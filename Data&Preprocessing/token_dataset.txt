We O
state O

simple O
but O
important O
fact O
in O
Theorem O

a O

The O
following O
two O
statements O
are O
equivalent O
: O
Proof O
It O
is O
straightforward O
to O
note O
that O
, O
as O
ATy O
= O
c O
, O
we O
have O
cTx O

However O
it O
will O
be O
useful O
to O
our O
subsequent O
extension O
to O
note O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
rows-pace O
is O
the O
orthogonal O
complement O

the O
nullspace O
, O
and O
can O
be O
also O
written O
as O
. O

Equivalently O
, O
any O
vector O
z O
in O
the O
nullspace O
may O
be O
described O
as O
a O
difference O
between O

i.e O

, O
z O

x1 O
– O
x2 O
, O
where O
x1 O
, O
x2 O
∈ O
SEC O
. O

Therefore O
the O
rowspace O
may O
also O
be O
written O
as O
, O
which O
explicitly O
states O
the O
equivalence O

The O
principal O
components O
of O
A O
corresponding O
to O
the O
r O
nonzero O
singular O
values O
must O
be O
in O
the O
rowspace O
. O

Again O
, O
given O
a O
singular-value O
decomposition O
A O
= O
USVT O
, O
we O
have O
VSUTy O
= O
c O
for O

and O
hence O
, O
where O
the O
ui O

are O

Later O
we O

also O

The O
