A 90 day Timeline Followback (TLFB) calendar was used to measure the frequency and amount of drinking for all subjects. The first dimension of impulsivity, trait-impulsivity, was measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), which is one of the most widely-used self-report measures of trait-impulsivity, refers to aspects of inattention, spontaneous actions, and lack of forethought.

It includes Urgency (negative) (UPPS (\u2212)), Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation-seeking, and Positive-urgency (UPPS (+)). Second dimension of impulsivity is choice impulsivity. This deficiency was measured by delay discounting task (DDT). The DDT measures impulsivity by presenting the subject with an option between receiving a smaller immediate monetary reward or a potentially greater delayed reward. Participants were presented with a choice between an immediate reward and a fixed larger ($100) but delayed (zero to 30 days) rewards. Accordingly, a discounting factor k represents the rate of discounting of the delayed outcome. As k values are not normally distributed, a natural log-transformation is usually applied and the ln(k) is used for the analyses. Higher ln(k) values mean greater preference for immediate rewards.

The results showed that compared with abstainer, relapsers exhibited significantly decreased resting state synchrony within the reward network, the executive control network, and the visual network. The same group also studied functional organization in long-term abstinent alcoholics. The results revealed that compared with normal controls, long-term abstinence led to decreased synchrony within the limbic reward regions, such as the caudate and the thalamus, when using the sgACC and the NAcc seeds. Seed-based methods have also been used to identify the role of the posterior cingulate cortex in the default mode network as well as the potential for the cerebellum to be a node within the DMN. The study revealed the compromised FC in the posterior cingulate and the frontocerebellar regions in alcoholics. Those studies focused on connectivity patterns of predefined seed regions. Our work identified differences between AD and HC within large-scale brain networks and between-network coupling that are important in addiction disorders using data-driven method. More specifically, the FC in the \u201cimpulsive\u201d system (ASN) exhibited greater FC in AD relative to HC. ASN contains the nucleus accumbens, putamen, and caudate which are known to be involved in primary reward processing. It is widely accepted that alcohol stimulates dopamine release in the ventral striatum, and thus reinforces alcohol consumption. This suggested that AD might have enhanced intrinsic neuronal activity in the ASN at rest. This finding is consistent with preclinical reports showing that alcohol induces a persistent increase in the baseline sensitivity of brain reward systems. ASN also has been reported to exhibit greater FC in smokers than normal controls. Thus, the greater ASN FC we found in AD relative to HC may represent a chronic alcohol-induced increase in baseline reward-system sensitivity. AD also exhibited greater FC in amygdala within the ASN. The amygdala is thought to primarily contribute to the acquisition, consolidation, and expression of learning of the drug-related cues that drive relapse to drug-seeking behaviors. This area is also robustly activated under drug-related cues, and was found to exhibit robust resting-state FC with affective brain areas including OFC. Our finding of enhanced FC in the amygdala may be relevant to previous studies that have demonstrated the involvement of these areas in the pathology of addiction. The next system implicated in addiction is \u201creflective\u201d system which contains three networks in our study: OFCN, LECN and RECN. Our findings indicate greater within-network FC within the OFCN in AD relative to HC. The OFC and MPFC are major areas of motivation, drive, and salience evaluation, which are impaired in drug addicts and play an important role in the output of compulsive drug-seeking behaviors. Studies have shown enhanced activation in specific mesocorticolimbic dopamine system areas including OFC in alcohol-cue exposure. In the present study, significantly increased resting-state FC was found, consistent with the previous results. The ECN serves a wide range of cognitive control functions. The prefrontal cortex is important for decision-making, inhibitory control and self-awareness, and it may become hypoactive in states of addiction. The ECN might be viewed as particularly pertinent to the field of substance dependence since it is thought to be involved in goal-directed behavior and cognitive control. The increased motivation to find and use drugs combined with an inability to inhibit drug-related behaviors is thought to represent a failure of executive control. Resting state studies have identified that this network operates in a lateralized manner. Studies have shown that Individuals with drug addictions have increased willingness to approach rewards. Approach behaviors are thought to involve executive control processes, and left prefrontal cortex is known to be more strongly involved in approach behaviors compared to right prefrontal cortex. Studies also suggest that the RECN was more strongly associated with avoidance. Compare to HC, our results showed that AD exhibited greater FC within the LECN, but there was no significant difference between AD and HC in terms of FC within the RECN. Studies have shown substance dependent individuals have greater left hemisphere connectivity in the LECN at rest.

In this study, we found enhanced within-network FC in bilateral anterior insula and right posterior insula in AD. This may reflect the changes of motivational states as well as the subjective awareness of the craving state in AD. We also found enhanced between-network coupling among SN, ASN and ECN. This may provide some evidence that these three networks were working together to compensate the compromised functionality caused by structural damage of alcohol. However, the FC only reflects the temporal correlations between regions, and on its face value it does not provide any direct information how these correlations are mediated. How these three systems interacted with each other was still unknown. Further studies and analyses such as mediation analysis on these three systems as well as DTI data to provide more detailed information about structural connectivity are needed to test the hypothesis proposed by No\u00ebl et al. that the insula would modulate the dynamics between the impulsive system and reflective system.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27109, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Connectivity of DMN has been linked to the core processes of human cognition, including mind-wandering and self-monitoring, the integration of cognitive and emotional processing, and introspective thoughts.

In this study, we also found increased FC in ACC within a-DMN which has been known as an important region in cognitive control and error monitoring. This result may underline addiction-related impairment of cognitive control. Task-based fMRI studies have shown that impaired suppression of the DMN is related to poor cognitive performance such as memory formation and compromised learning of cognitive skill.

These approaches center the outcomes as a result of the balance of the Impulsive and reflexive circuits. This Reflexive/Impulsive model has been used for explaining the relationship among RSN. A more complex circuitry that explains the relationship among the RSNs of this reflexive-Impulse system in addiction incorporates not only the connectivity among RSNs but also the connectivity between regions within each RSN.
