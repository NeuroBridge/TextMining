However it remains unclear whether these alterations are disorder-specific or shared, and whether they clearly relate to symptom generation or not. We studied brain responses to unexpected rewards during a simulated slot-machine game in 24 patients with depression, 21 patients with schizophrenia, and 21 healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We investigated relationships between brain activation, task-related motivation, and questionnaire rated anhedonia. There was reduced activation in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, inferior temporal gyrus, and occipital cortex in both depression and schizophrenia in comparison with healthy participants during receipt of unexpected reward. In the medial prefrontal cortex both patient groups showed reduced activation, with activation significantly more abnormal in schizophrenia than depression. Anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortical activation predicted task-related motivation, which in turn predicted anhedonia severity in schizophrenia. Our findings provide evidence for overlapping hypofunction in ventral striatal and orbitofrontal regions in depression and schizophrenia during unexpected reward receipt, and for a relationship between unexpected reward processing in the medial prefrontal cortex and the generation of motivational states.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1575, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1588, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Depression and schizophrenia are associated with deficits in motivation and enjoyment, which have been collectively termed anhedonia by some authors.

Some evidence suggests that striatal hypofunction during reward processing is present in schizophrenia and depression, and may contribute to the motivational and hedonic problems experienced by patients, whilst other authors have emphasized the importance of orbitofrontal cortex function in this regard. It remains unknown whether the neurobiological disturbances in reward processing are different in schizophrenia and depression and it is not yet clear which aspects of reward processing are particularly problematic in these conditions, or whether any associated neural deficits are predominantly cortical or subcortical in origin.

Parietal activation associated with the uncertainty of outcomes has previously been shown to be abnormal in schizophrenia. In the medial prefrontal cortex, including the superior frontal gyrus and anterior paracingulate, activation in both patient groups was significantly abnormal (showing hypoactivation to unexpected reward receipt) with the schizophrenia group showing significantly greater abnormality than the depression group. Medial frontal and anterior cingulate hypoactivation has been reported during the receipt of an expected reward in schizophrenia, and preclinical studies indicate that these cortical regions are critical for motivated behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23825, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Relationship Between Brain Responses to an Unexpected Reward And Motivational Scores", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23910, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Motivation to play the game was positively associated with activation to unexpected reward in a cluster situated in medial prefrontal areas, including the anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyrus, in the whole sample (adjusting for diagnosis); this cluster overlapped with the medial prefrontal cluster in which schizophrenia participants showed lower activation than controls and depression, and depression participants showed lower activation than controls, when receiving an unexpected reward. This evidence of an association between brain response to unexpected reward receipt and motivation, rather than pleasure, adds complexity and nuance to models of reward processing that parse pleasure and motivation into separable psychological processes with distinct neural components. However, a full-model should take account of how unexpected reward-related responses influences future behavior through motivation. Although SHAPS scores were associated with task-related measures of motivation, and brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex was associated with task-related motivation, there was no direct association between brain activation and SHAPS scores, suggesting that medial prefrontal activation may be indirectly associated with anhedonic symptoms via its association with task-related motivation.

In experiments in healthy volunteers, certain antipsychotics and antidepressants have been shown to result in reduced reward-related brain activation; other experiments in healthy controls and in patients with schizophrenia have suggested that atypical antipsychotic medications may improve reward-related brain activation relative to placebo or to typical antipsychotic medication. The balance of the (limited) evidence suggests that antidepressant and (atypical) antipsychotic treatment help normalize brain responses to reward-related stimuli in patients with depression and schizophrenia, respectively. All of our schizophrenia participants were taking atypical antipsychotic medication. Given that we did not find significant differences between medicated vs unmedicated depressed participants and no associations between brain activity and dose of medication, it is not likely that medication completely explains the reward processing group differences observed in our study, though we recognize that studies in patients not taking medication are required to confirm our results. We note that there have been some previous studies documenting altered striatal reward prediction error signaling in unmedicated schizophrenia patients (eg,). All of our patient participants subjectively endorsed at least some degree of anhedonia, so our results may not be representative of patients with schizophrenia and depression who are not anhedonic.
