Furthermore, cannabinoids can activate CB1 receptors in the hippocampus, effecting dopamine release and higher activation in the service of normative performance in vigilance tasks is typical of cannabis studies in youth.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25177, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It should be noted, however, that the response inhibition task used in this study might have assessed additional cognitive constructs. For example, the task involved a low-frequency presentation which is susceptible to the oddball effect, and a switching target between runs which potentially recruited working memory networks. Further, the task was relatively easy for most participants and involved repetitive stimuli, which may have resulted in the task assessing attention more generally as opposed to response inhibition. The alignment of our results with meta-analysis results of attention tasks support this theory. While one could argue that the lack of anterior cingulate cortex differences in ADHD contradicts this, anterior cingulate activation appears to diminish with increasing age.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25974, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite the robust effects of diagnosis presented in this work, there are limitations to be considered. LNCG sample sizes were small when considering subgroups broken down by site and cannabis use status. This is especially relevant for the lack of significant difference between smoking status in ADHD and LNCG participants, and correlations with activation and age of first use. Further, the ADHD and LNCG groups differed in the number of correct NoGo trials, thereby potentially influencing statistical inference. In addition, our sample, especially the cannabis users, was disproportionately male. A recent study found gender differences in right parietal and left fronto-parietal regions during motor inhibition. Although our secondary analyses using gender as a covariate did not show it to significantly impact the findings, our results may not generalize to female cannabis-users. We also excluded adults who reported binge-drinking alcohol more than once a week. Heavy drinking, often co-occurring with frequent cannabis use, may have contributed to results in prior studies. We did not assess brain-based activity prior to cannabis use; longitudinal studies with both behavioral and imaging measures are needed to disentangle a temporal ordering of constructs. Regardless, to our knowledge, this study is the largest to date investigating the association between ADHD and cannabis use, and, as a multisite study encompassing a heterogeneous sample, increases the generalizability of results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27476, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We caution that the absence of behavioral decrements in regular light cannabis users does not necessarily indicate that chronic cannabis exerts minimal effects on the non-intoxicated brain. We detected a cannabis-by-ADHD interaction in hippocampus and cerebellar vermis, where activation during inhibition was higher in cannabis users compared to non-users, but only within the non-ADHD subject groups. Altered gray matter volume in right parahippocampal gyrus, right hippocampus, and cerebellar vermis has been found in cannabis-using subjects. Moreover, greater right parahippocampal recruitment during a face-naming task was also found in cannabis users. Therefore, it is possible that altered patterns of activation to Go/NoGo faces in these structures among non-ADHD cannabis users stem from these morphological abnormalities, where the ADHD neurodevelopmental phenotype avoids this regional brain effect by engaging different neurocircuitry to inhibit non-target behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28455, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Indeed, a recent comprehensive review of 43 studies examining structural and functional brain differences between chronic cannabis users and controls indicates numerous altered patterns (usually increases) of brain activation in the service of normal behavioral performance in cannabis users. Such activation increases in cortical executive control regions are typically interpreted as evidence of less efficient cortical processing and where, in contrast, reduced activation in response to impulsive errors can be interpreted as blunted awareness of errors in drug users. Therefore, the lack of behavioral and brain main effects of regular light cannabis use may not generalize beyond young adult light-to-moderate users and may not apply to older cannabis users following decades of use.
