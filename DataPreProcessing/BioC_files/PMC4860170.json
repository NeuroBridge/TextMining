However, no previous study has assessed the relationship between these markers of central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction in AD participants and their potential joint effects on relapse risk. Forty early abstinent, treatment engaged AD patients underwent a laboratory experiment with exposure to neutral, alcohol, and stress cues and a separate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan with similar cue exposure. Neutral-relaxed state cort:ACTH ratio was significantly associated with VmPFC hyperreactivity to neutral-relaxing cues, and also with hypoactivation in response to alcohol and stress cues in AD patients. Basal heart rate, neutral cort:ACTH ratio, and neutral VmPFC hyperreactivty were each associated with risk of relapse. However, abnormal VmPFC activation and elevated cort:ACTH ratio overlap in predicting risk for relapse, and dysfunctional VmPFC response was the sole significant predictor of odds of relapse in a joint model of relapse risk.

However, our understanding of how peripheral stress responses relate to neurobiological mechanisms associated with the chronic, relapsing nature of AD is limited. Chronic alcohol abuse and stress have been linked to altered hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) dysfunction and altered basal sympathetic activity. For example, blunted HPA axis reactivity to stress has been associated with increased craving and risk of relapse in early abstinent AD participants (, Junghanns et al., 2003). Recently, work from our laboratory has indicated that AD-associated HPA axis dysfunction may also be reflected in high morning fasting basal levels of cortisol and high adrenal sensitivity in the active neutral-relaxing condition, as measured by a high cortisol: adrenocorticotropic hormone ratio (cort:ACTH ratio). A higher than normal morning cort:ACTH ratio is indicative of greater cortisol in the blood and therefore the brain. This upregulated adrenal state may prevent an effective cortisol response to acute stressors, in part by altering autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. AD-associated ANS dysfunction may be evidenced by elevated basal heart rate and lower heart rate variability. The effects of increased basal heart rate therefore could be to worsen stress regulation, a potentially significant factor influencing alcoholic binge drinking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3268, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the central nervous system (CNS), overlearned associations between negative affect and alcohol consumption are encoded by striatal reward and habit circuits. Recent studies suggest that AD and stress each contribute to a corresponding loss of inhibitory regulation of these basal ganglia circuits by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The repeated cycles of alcohol binges and withdrawal characteristic of AD result in increased glutamatergic activity and decreased GABAergic tone throughout the striatal corticolimbic circuits, leading to a hyper-excitable, basal neurophysiological state. The combination of increased basal CRH tone and altered glutamatergic signaling results in altered monoamergic transmission during acute withdrawal that continues into protracted withdrawal. Clinically, this altered neurobiology is associated with increased anxiety, negative mood, high alcohol craving, sleep difficulties, and poor impulse control. It follows that during early abstinence, alcohol cues are especially salient and in combination with stress, negative mood, and anxiety, are among the most commonly cited reasons for relapse in AD. Environmental and interoceptive alcohol and stress cues are therefore especially relevant during protracted withdrawal/early abstinence and may also significantly impact relapse risk (Sinha, 2012).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4602, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our group has developed and validated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocols that assess the central nervous system responses to neutral-relaxed, alcohol, and stress cues and laboratory paradigms that assess the peripheral (endocrine and autonomic) responses to neutral-relaxed, alcohol, and stress cues that are relevant in alcohol relapse (, 2012). Using these paradigms, we reported hyperactivation in regulatory regions, i.e., ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VmPFC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), during the neutral-relaxing state, and that response is predictive of shortened time to relapse in AD patients. Conversely, we reported that blunted neural VmPFC/rACC response to stress is predictive of time to relapse and relapse severity. In addition, in a different study, we reported both high fasting morning cortisol level and high cort: ACTH ratio, a marker of adrenal sensitivity, were predictive of time to relapse.

For example, the VmPFC receives extensive visceral input and in turn, regulates autonomic system activity. The VmPFC is also involved in the suppression of negative affect and cognitions related to long term consequences. Furthermore, the rACC works in conjunction with the VmPFC to suppress prepotent (habit-driven) responses to stimuli and rACC activation is necessary for behavioral flexibility. The VmPFC modulates stress-related physiological changes via its influence on the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and HPA activity. Increased HPA axis activity and high glucocorticoids may decrease prefrontal inhibition of peripheral and central stress responses via steroid-induced upregulation of excitatory amino acids, which may interact with pro-inflammatory cytokines to decrease synaptic relay efficacy between the VmPFC and PVN. Additionally, both the VmPFC and rACC influence behavioral and emotional coping responses to alcohol and stress and cues via direct synaptic connections to the extended amygdala. If these synaptic relays are damaged via glucocorticoid-induced excitotoxicity, then self-directed behavior may be replaced by habit and sensory-driven automatic responding (Bechara et al., 2005,).

Correlation among these peripheral and central stress response measures would support the hypothesis that prefrontal and HPA axis dysfunction, due to stress and AD, interact with and are potentially causally related to one another. Therefore, we performed an independent analysis on a subgroup of AD participants who each participated in two separate studies of neural fMRI response to stress and alcohol cues related to relapse risk and in the peripheral stress response related to relapse risk during the same alcohol abstinence and inpatient treatment episode, reported in our previous papers. Given that these AD patients participated in both studies, it permitted the unique opportunity to examine relationships between peripheral and central prefrontal stress responses and their unique and combined contribution to future relapse. We attempted to determine if statistical associations exist between adrenal sensitivity, basal heart rate, and neural activation in medial prefrontal stress regulation regions of the brain in response to neutral-relaxing, alcohol, and stress cues.

Thus, the VmPFC, the seat of visceral motor regulation and emotion regulation, exerts less control over the HPA axis and autonomic reactivity. For example, the autonomic dysfunction indicated by increased basal heart rate in AD may be a consequence of VmPFC hypoactivation during stress, an inability to exert executive control over limbic and striatal regions, and the associated emotional dysregulation. However, resting heart rate is not only related to sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, but also a dysregulation of parasympathetic activity. This imbalance between the functional branches of the motor division of the peripheral nervous system may, in turn, influence neural activity during acutely stressful states. Given the multitude of factors that influence resting heart rate, it is not surprising that it was not independently predictive of shorted time to relapse in our analyses. Further study on the exact nature of the interactions between VmPFC activity, HPA axis dysregulation, and autonomic disturbances are necessary to elucidate their exact roles in relapse to alcoholic drinking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28676, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, there are a few important limitations of this study. First, the cort:ACTH ratio were not measured during the fMRI session, but rather assessed in a separate laboratory experiment. However, the finding that morning fasting adrenal sensitivity assessed during a laboratory experimental session involving neutral and stress provocation correlated with neural response to similar cue exposure days later in an fMRI experiment suggests there is an enduring relationship between HPA axis sensitization and the inability to regulate basal stress reactivity or to mount an adequate neural prefrontal response to stress and alcohol cues in recovering AD individuals. Second, although elevated heart rate is a biomarker of autonomic dysregulation, lower hear rate variability has been shown to be an important indicator of stress reactivity and dysregulation and the current study did not record heart rate variability during the experiments. Third, given the small sample size we were unable to examine sex differences in these biomarkers of AD. Etiological differences in the course of AD between men and women have been reported, and thus endocrine and neural mechanisms that underlie relapse may differ between the sexes. Additionally, 90% of our sample were current smokers and the potential contribution of nicotine dependence to adrenal sensitivity and/or VmPFC activity was not able to be distinguished in this analysis. Thus, these findings need to replicated and extended in a larger sample. Despite these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between adrenal sensitivity, basal heart rate, and neural response to neutral, alcohol, and stress cues in early abstinent AD patients. The findings suggest clear interactions between the neural response to neutral-relaxing, alcohol, and stress cues and HPA axis and autonomic dysregulation in AD and in their role in alcohol relapse risk. The exact nature and directionality of these interactions may differ during acute and chronic alcohol intake and depend on both context and disease progression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30778, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These limitations notwithstanding, neutral-relaxed state cort: ACTH ratio appears to be a significant biomarker of VmPFC dysfunction in AD, which itself is a neuromarker that might be used in future studies of AD risk and relapse. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that neuromarkers tend to provide more accurate prognosis than traditional behavioral measures. Treatment providers can benefit from using peripheral biomarkers, including altered adrenal sensitivity, as proxy for neural dysfunction to identify patients at greater risk of relapse. If accessible, fMRI of VmPFC hyperreactivity in the neutral-relaxing state might serve as a more sensitive and specific predictor of relapse risk. Furthermore, normalization of VmPFC dysfunction may be a useful target in medication or behavioral therapy trials. The development of pharmacotherapies for AUDs has sometimes proceeded directly from promising preclinical results to randomized clinical trials, leading to disappointing and conflicting results. For example, medications that directly affect HPA axis functioning, such as CRH antagonists, seem to have little effect on human drinking behavior, despite robust effects in animal models. This might be due to the multiple interactions between the HPA axis, the SAM system, the HPG axis, and the PFC in AUDs. We suggest that intermediate human laboratory and neuroimaging paradigms should be used to test the effects of novel therapeutics on alcohol-induced stress system alterations that influence craving and relapse. Specifically, there may be benefit in future a priori tests of these hypotheses to be conducted in simultaneously collected endocrine, autonomic, and neural measures at repeated time points in early abstinence. For example, endocrine and autonomic data could be collected during tests of neurofeedback aimed at reducing craving. As disrupted prefrontal control is emerging as a key aspect of alcohol craving and relapse, multimodal studies core stress systems markers and related psychological variables (affect and behavior regulation) may elucidate novel therapeutic mechanisms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32899, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32922, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Author contributions: DS and RS were responsible for the study concept and design.
