Most of these functions are impaired in schizophrenia, for example, the impaired decision-making has been thought to be a stable and independent psychopathology in schizophrenia, which has been attributed to the dysfunction of the right PFm. In addition, patients with lesions involving the PFm have shown impairment in recognition of pictures and sounds. Although we did not find any rsFC abnormality between PFm and cognitive-related brain regions that directly accounts for cognitive dysfunction, we found abnormal rsFC between the PFm and the visual and sensorimotor regions. These findings suggest that the abnormal integration of sensory and motor information in the PFm may indirectly affect cognitive processing in patients with schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22099, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several limitations should be noted when one interprets our findings. First, most of the schizophrenia patients participating in this study have received antipsychotic drugs with different time periods. Although we did not find any significant correlations between the rsFC changes of the IPL subregions and the antipsychotic dosages in these patients and significant differences in the rsFCs of the bilateral PFm between the 9 drug-na\u00efve patients and the 86 patients with antipsychotic treatments, we cannot absolutely exclude the possible influence of the various antipsychotic medications on our results. Further studies are needed to validate our findings in a large sample of drug-na\u00efve patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Second, because most of patients were chronic patients with schizophrenia, we cannot determine whether our findings can be generalized to all stages of schizophrenia. Third, we did not collect neuropsychological data on multiple sensory integration, sensorimotor integration, and IPL-related cognitive processing. The lack of these behavioral data prevents us from drawing a definite conclusion on our findings. Finally, we selected asymmetric seed regions for the two hemispheric IPLs, preventing us from accurately comparing connectivity patterns and differences between the two hemispheres.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23428, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23439, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "By systematically investigating the rsFC changes of the IPL subregions in schizophrenia, we found that only the PFm had significantly increased rsFC with the visual and sensorimotor regions in schizophrenia patients.

Moreover, the abnormally increased rsFC between the PFm and the sensorimotor-related regions may indicate abnormalities in multi-sensory integration and sensorimotor integration in schizophrenia, which may further interfere the cognitive processing of the PFm of the IPL.
