Dynamic FNC is a recent extension of the conventional FNC analysis that takes into account FNC changes over short periods of time. While such dynamic FNC measures may be more informative about various aspects of connectivity, there has been no detailed head-to-head comparison of the ability of static and dynamic FNC to perform classification in complex mental illnesses. This paper proposes a framework for automatic classification of schizophrenia, bipolar and healthy subjects based on their static and dynamic FNC features. Also, we compare cross-validated classification performance between static and dynamic FNC. Results show that the dynamic FNC significantly outperforms the static FNC in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating that features from dynamic FNC have distinct advantages over static FNC for classification purposes. Moreover, combining static and dynamic FNC features does not significantly improve the classification performance over the dynamic FNC features alone, suggesting that static FNC does not add any significant information when combined with dynamic FNC for classification purposes. A three-way classification methodology based on static and dynamic FNC features discriminates individual subjects into appropriate diagnostic groups with high accuracy. Our proposed classification framework is potentially applicable to additional mental disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1730, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1. Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1746, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Functional connectivity (FC) can be quantified using a variety of different neuroimaging techniques. A commonly used measure is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures synchronized brain activity via blood oxygenation and infers functional interactions among different brain regions. FC, defined as temporal correlation (or other types of statistical dependency) among spatially distant brain regions, has recently been used to examine the functional organization and temporal dependencies among these remote brain regions. Different analytic tools have been applied to resting-state fMRI data to describe brain functional connectivity. Two widely used FC approaches are (i) seed-based analysis and (ii) purely data-driven methods, such as ICA. FC can also be investigated at the network level using spatial independent component analysis (ICA), and connectivity among spatial components is referred to as functional network connectivity (FNC).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2712, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The majority of FNC studies are primarily based on the assumption that FNC is stationary throughout the entire scan session (or at least stationary during a given task or resting-state condition). Static FNC analysis overlooks the fact that individual subjects are likely to engage in slightly different mental activities at different instances in time. Also evidence of dynamic fluctuation in FC from several studies supports the idea of dynamic changes in FC during the experimental period. More recently, studies have started utilizing the powerful information contained within the temporal features of spontaneous FC of BOLD signals. Connectivity dynamics capture uncontrolled but reoccurring patterns of interactions among intrinsic networks during task engagement or at rest. These studies provide results that cannot be detected with static functional connectivity analyses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3594, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There is an increasing interest in designing robust and accurate techniques to classify subjects into groups using functional imaging data. For example, previous studies showed the use of functional connectivity-based features for classification of schizophrenia and bipolar patients at the individual level. used an atlas-based method to extract mean time-courses of 116 brain regions in the resting-state for both healthy controls and schizophrenia subjects. The correlation between these time-courses made the feature vector for each subject. By applying feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods, they reduced the dimensionality down to three where they classified patients from controls with a high accuracy. proposed a classification approach for schizophrenia patients based on fMRI time-series from the voxels showing between-group temporal dissimilarity using leave-one-out cross-validation method. Another study combined both structural and functional MRI data for classification of schizophrenia patients and created a training set by projecting the high dimensional data onto a lower dimensional space using the principle component analysis (PCA), achieving a high classification accuracy. A recent study performed automatic classification of schizophrenia using both structural and functional MRI features, and showed that better classification accuracy could be achieved by using both MRI features, compared to using only a single feature. However, only a few studies have focused on classification analyses of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. In, temporal lobe and default mode networks were used as features using a leave-one-out cross-validation framework, and classified schizophrenia and bipolar patients at individual level. In another classification study, a support vector machine (SVM) was applied on the verbal fluency task-based patterns of regional brain responses to identify schizophrenia and bipolar patients at the individual level.

Several previous studies have shown that schizophrenia and bipolar patients can be discriminated at group-level by using the information on dysfunctional integration of the brain.We hypothesized that disrupted functional integration in schizophrenia and bipolar patients as captured by FNC analysis reveal powerful information for automatic discriminative analysis at subject-level. We expected some connectivity measures to be better captured in a static model and others in a dynamic model. Static FNC provides information about the overall mean connectivity and may be more optimal for connectivity that is persistent across the entire experiment than a dynamic FNC approach. On the other hand, information on local connectivity changes at different time windows will be better captured by dynamic FNC. Thus, we hypothesize that both static and dynamic FNC methods capture complementary aspects of connectivity, and combining static and dynamic FNC features will improve classification performance beyond the achievable performance from each type of these features individually.
