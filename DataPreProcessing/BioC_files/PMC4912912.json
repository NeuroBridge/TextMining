The standard methods for calculating the order of multimodal data focus only on sources with the greatest individual energy and ignore relations across datasets. Additionally, these techniques as well as the most widely-used methods for determining the degree of similarity between datasets assume sufficient sample support and are not effective in the sample-poor regime. In this paper, we propose to jointly estimate the degree of similarity between datasets and their order when few samples are present using principal component analysis and canonical correlation analysis (PCA-CCA). By considering these two problems simultaneously, we are able to minimize the assumptions placed on the data and achieve superior performance in the sample-poor regime compared to traditional techniques. We apply PCA-CCA to the pairwise combinations of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) data drawn from patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while performing an auditory oddball task. The PCA-CCA results indicate that the fMRI and sMRI datasets are the most similar, whereas the sMRI and EEG datasets share the least similarity.

This is particularly an issue when performing multimodal data fusion, since the number of samples, i.e. subjects, is typically much less than the dimension of the neurological data that is used.

Other methods for estimating the number of common and distinctive sources include: orthogonal n-way partial least squares (OnPLS), generalized singular value decomposition, and distinctive and common components with simultaneous-component analysis (DISCO-SCA). These methods all assume sufficient sample support and thus perform poorly when the number of samples is not significantly greater than the number of observations.
