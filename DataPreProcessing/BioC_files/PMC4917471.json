As yet however, complex brain network topology in AD and its association with disease progression are unknown. We applied graph theory to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to examine weighted global efficiency and local (clustering coefficient, degree and eigenvector centrality) network topology and the functional role of the striatum in 24 AD patients compared with 20 matched healthy controls (HCs), and their association with dependence characteristics. Graph analyses were performed based on Pearson\u2019s correlations between RS-fMRI time series, while correcting for age, gender and head motion. We found no significant group differences between AD patients and HCs in network topology. Notably, within the patient group, but not in HCs, the whole-brain network showed reduced average cluster coefficient with more severe alcohol use, whereas longer AD duration within the patient group was associated with a global decrease in efficiency, degree and clustering coefficient. Additionally, within four a-priori chosen bilateral striatal nodes, alcohol use severity was associated with lower clustering coefficient in the left caudate. Longer AD duration was associated with reduced clustering coefficient in caudate and putamen, and reduced degree in bilateral caudate, but with increased eigenvector centrality in left posterior putamen. Especially changes in global network topology and clustering coefficient in anterior striatum remained strikingly robust after exploratory variations in network weight.

AD and other substance use disorders are regarded as disorders of the brain, and knowledge on the underlying neurobiology has increased tremendously over the past decades (for reviews see e.g.). In this process, functional neuro-imaging techniques have been widely used to show cue-specific or task-specific changes in local brain activity. These studies have shown a central role of the striatum in addiction, as it is highly involved in reward-related behaviors as well as habit formation, constructs that are pivotal in addictive behaviors. A change in striatal involvement over the course of the disorder is also shown, such as increased involvement of posterior putamen during cue-reactivity and instrumental learning in more chronic and more compulsive alcohol dependent subjects. Still, focusing solely on local functional alterations under task-specific circumstances hampers insights into integrated global brain functioning in non-task related circumstances, which contributes to behavioral variability. Moreover, it remains unclear how integration between striatal brain areas into a broader functional network in the brain is related to the duration and severity characteristics of AD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3277, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, in the study of substance use disorders, integration between brain areas has been studied by examining functional connectivity with techniques such as independent or principal component analysis, dynamic causal modeling or a priori defined seed-based connectivity.

However, the brain is increasingly considered a connectome, representing a complex network of highly intercommunicating neural components. Knowledge about the connectome in patients with a substance use disorder is scarce and to our knowledge absent in patients with AD.

In general, RS-fMRI is a reliable and valid technique that shows proficient testretest reliability, meaningfully correlates with the (neuronal) EEG-signal, and is associated with cognitive functioning both in health and disease. The application of graph theory on RS-fMRI has been used in numerous neurological disorders to demonstrate an altered resting-state brain network with reduced integrity and reduced efficiency of disease-related networks (e.g.). The graph theoretical approach is fairly new within the field of psychiatry, but it rapidly gains attention.

The EC is a measure of the influence of a node in a network. Basically, a node with a high EC has connections with nodes that themselves have a strong connection with many other nodes that are central within the network.

This may have influenced our results on the relation between AD severity with global and local network characteristics. Therefore, we included total GM volume as an additional covariate to all between group and within group analyses. GM volume correction did not affect the comparison of topology network characteristics between the AD and the HC group, which remained non-significant. Within the AD group, the global network characteristics were still significantly lower in patients with longer AD duration (CCN: P = 0.0072; DN: P = 0.0129; GE: P = 0.0146), whereas the inverse relation between AD severity and CCN became trendwise significant (r2 = 0.4867, P = 0.0750). When adding total GM volume as a covariate to the striatal analyses most of the original results remained significant: higher AD severity was still associated with lower CCi in the left caudate nucleus (P = 0.0472), and longer AD duration was still associated with lower CCi in the bilateral caudate nucleus (Left: P = 0.0443; Right: P = 0.0251) and left anterior putamen (P = 0.0367), with lower Di in the right caudate nucleus (P = 0.0414), and with higher ECi in left posterior putamen (P = 0.0174).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25728, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "DISCUSSION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25739, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The brain network topology of AD patients does not significantly differ from that of HCs.

Reduced global network efficiency adversely affects cognition, including intelligence. It is therefore conceivable that these network changes in AD are partly responsible for cognitive dysfunctions reported in addicted patients. Interestingly, local topology in the striatum also seemed associated with AD characteristics. Reduced efficiency with longer AD duration in anterior striatum (caudate nucleus and anterior putamen), thought to be involved in goal-directed behavior, is consistent with prior evidence of reduced anterior putamen activation in alcohol dependent patients during goal-directed behavior. We also see a putative increase in network centrality of the posterior putamen with longer AD duration, an area known for its involvement in habitual actions. This finding could match the notion of a negative spiral towards maladaptive habitual drug taking in addiction-vulnerable animals and human addiction, such as AD (for reviews, see:). Using task-related functional MRI, we earlier showed increased posterior putamen involvement during cuereactivity and instrumental learning with prolonged AD duration. It should be noted that in the current study, contrary to the consistent topology changes in whole-brain network, caudate and anterior putamen, topology changes in the striatum associated with AD severity, and changes in the posterior putamen with AD duration were inconsistent when exploring a broader range of thresholds of the weighted graph (see Table S 3).

Some local network characteristics outside the striatum only differed between groups when considered at an uncorrected threshold (see Supporting Information Table S1). The lack of group differences is especially surprising considering the here shown association between network topology and AD characteristics. The fact that a large portion of our AD sample was recruited from a population-based cohort, which did not primarily seek help for alcohol-related problems, might contribute to this. This has namely led to the inclusion of a heteroge-neous AD sample with some minimally severe AD patients producing a weak contrast between the AD and the HC groups. To further explore this, we post hoc split the AD group based on median AUDIT score to compare the most severe patients with HC, see Supporting Information Text S1. This does indicate a deviation from \u2018healthy\u2019 in more severe AD patients with an AUDIT score above the clinical cut-off (AUDIT score: 20) for risk of dependence. However, considering the smaller subsample (n = 12) of this exploratory analysis, and the weak effects on global topology, this should be interpreted with caution. Notably, other studies using graph analysis in behavioral addictions similarly failed to show a difference in global network topology with HCs, while also showing disease-associated effects within the patient samples.
