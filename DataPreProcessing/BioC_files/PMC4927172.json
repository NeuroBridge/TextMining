Using these time series, one can estimate frequency-band specific functional connectivity between sensors or regions of interest, and thereby construct functional brain networks that can be examined from a graph theoretic perspective. Despite their common use, however, practical guidelines for the choice of wavelet method, filter, and length have remained largely undelineated. Here, we explicitly explore the effects of wavelet method (MODWT vs. DWT), wavelet filter (Daubechies Extremal Phase, Daubechies Least Asymmetric, and Coiflet families), and wavelet length (2 to 24)\u2014each essential parameters in wavelet-based methods\u2014on the estimated values of graph metrics and in their sensitivity to alterations in psychiatric disease. We observe that the MODWT method produces less variable estimates than the DWT method. We also observe that the length of the wavelet filter chosen has a greater impact on the estimated values of graph metrics than the type of wavelet chosen. Furthermore, wavelet length impacts the sensitivity of the method to detect differences between health and disease and tunes classification accuracy. Collectively, our results suggest that the choice of wavelet method and length significantly alters the reliability and sensitivity of these methods in estimating values of metrics drawn from graph theory.

Although a relatively recent addition to the methods available for analyzing neuroimaging data, network science has enhanced our understanding of the brain as a complex system. Rooted in techniques derived from graph theory, brain network analysis has been used to study neural diseases, aging, and cognitive function. The graph theory formalism defines a network by nodes (brain regions) and edges (connections between brain regions). In neuroimaging studies, nodes can describe atlas-based regions or voxels, and edges can define physical connections, in the case of anatomical networks, or functional connections, which describe a statistical relationship between the activity time series of two nodes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2733, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The goal of generating a brain network is straightforward: to use network science to understand the structure and function of the brain.

Network analysis can also be used to explore fundamental principles of brain network organization, including small-world architecture, cost-efficiency, and reconfiguration dynamics. Across these studies, the main focus is to understand the organization of nodes and edges in the network. However, what has received less attention is the methodology used to define the functional relationships between nodes.

This feature undermines the utility of measuring functional connectivity between a pair of regional time series using a correlation (time domain) or coherence (frequency domain), because both time- and frequency-domain measures of association are not properly estimable for long memory processes.

We found that the MODWT produces less variable estimates than the DWT method, and that wavelet length significantly impacts graph metric values and sensitivity to group differences. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of reporting the choices utilized in neuroimaging studies and provide concrete recommendations for these choices in wavelet-based analyses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32898, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Wavelet Filtering versus Band Pass Filtering Before embarking on a thorough discussion of our results, it is worth briefly mentioning the differences\u2014including advantages and disadvantages\u2014of wavelet filtering versus band pass filtering. Importantly, the differences between the two methods have been extensively described and quantified in the mathematics and signal processing literature, but unfortunately have rarely been discussed in the neuroimaging literature. Perhaps the two most salient differences between the two methods lie in the preservation of signal shape and in the ability to denoise signal content. Simple bandpass filters traditionally used in time series analysis have the benefits of being easy and fast to compute but because they are implemented in the frequency domain, they have the unfortunate side effect of distorting the time domain, which in turn can alter the shape of transient waveforms, such as those characteristic of neural signals. Wavelet decomposition methods by contrast work simultaneously in the frequency and time domains by fitting \u201clittle waves\u201d or wavelets directly to the data, which offers greater veracity in representing neural signals. Moreover, wavelets offer simple denoising properties not offered by bandpass filtering. This is specifically because bandpass filters can only clean data in which the signal and the noise occupy different frequency bands. Unfortunately, in many neurophysiological time series, noise and desired signal occupy overlapping frequency bands, which is where wavelets can be used to some advantage. Specifically, wavelet methods can be used to decompose a noisy signal into different scales and remove the noise while preserving the signal, regardless of the frequency content. These denoising properties have demonstrated particular utility in the study of fMRI time series, such as those used in this study, but also in the context of ASL and PET. Together, the capabilities for signal preservation and cleaning make wavelet methods often preferable to bandpass methods.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34954, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Discrete versus Continuous Wavelet Transforms Once one has chosen to apply a wavelet filtering method, one is faced with the choice of using a discrete wavelet transform (DWT; or its close cousin the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform, MODWT), or using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Indeed, the CWT implemented with a Morlet wavelet has been used successfully in the study of fMRI time series. CWT works by computing the inner products of a continuous signal with a set of continuous wavelets. While an interesting and worthwhile approach, CWT has specific mathematical disadvantages that motivated us (and others, particularly in the context of fMRI time series) to focus our exposition on MODWT and DWT. These include the fact that (i) the CWT is inherently redundant and therefore computationally intensive, (ii) it does not provide information regarding signal phase, and (iii) one cannot reconstruct the original signal from the CWT coefficients (again, due to the redundancy). However, CWT also has some benefits, particularly in enabling an assessment of frequency bands that are not necessarily different by powers of 2. To capitalize on the major advantages of both the DWT and CWT approaches, it could be interesting in future to use the notions of wavelet packet trees to study hierarchical structure in fMRI BOLD time series and its impact on observed functional graph architecture.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36365, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the remainder of this section, we translate the results of our paper into concrete recommendations for the field, and we close with a brief discussion of important future directions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36551, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The Choice of Wavelet Method The superior performance of MODWT in the context of the numerical experiments performed here is consistent with features of its theoretical construction. First, and perhaps most importantly, MODWT is well defined for any signal length, making it statistically appropriate for the processing of arbitrary signals. In contrast, strictly speaking a DWT of level J0 can be applied only to signals whose length is a multiple of , significantly limiting its application to signals of arbitrary lengths. In practice when applying the DWT to signals of arbitrary lengths, one can choose to avoid this issue\u2014as we did in this study\u2014by preserving at most one extra scaling coefficient at each level of wavelet decomposition. Second, while DWT is an orthogonal transform, MODWT is not. In fact, MODWT is highly redundant and invariant under \u2018circular shift\u2019. This feature of MODWT preserves the smooth time-varying structure in regional time series that is otherwise lost during the application of DWT. In the context of human neuroimaging, analyses based on MODWT therefore more accurately reflect the dynamics of brain activity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37700, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The Choice of Wavelet Filter Type and Length Wavelet filter types offer differently shaped wavelets that can be applied to empirical time series in a wavelet decomposition. While there is a generally well-accepted notion that one should choose a wavelet that displays similar time-varying features to the time series at hand, we observed that wavelet filter type had very little influence on graph metrics extracted from resting state fMRI signals. The much larger factor impacting graph metrics was the wavelet length, which tunes the fine-scale detail of the wavelet shape: larger wavelet length provides smoother wavelets. In general, graph metrics obtained using the Daubechies Extremal Phase wavelets changed more from wavelet lengths 2 to 6 than from lengths 6 to 20. These results are intuitive: the changes in wavelet smoothness are more apparent at shorter wavelet lengths than at larger wavelet lengths, and their impact on estimated wavelet coefficients should follow. From a reliability perspective, we would argue that one would wish to choose a wavelet of a relatively larger length, to ensure that one\u2019s results are (i) not sensitive to artifacts of jagged edges in the wavelet and (ii) are relatively robust to small perturbations in wavelet length. Yet, it is important to keep in mind that very large wavelet lengths may suffer from the following limitations: (i) more coefficients may be influenced by boundary conditions, (ii) a decrease in the degree of localization of the wavelet coefficients, (iii) an increase in computational burden. The ideal choice may therefore be a moderate length that retains the advantages of long wavelets without gaining any associated disadvantages.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39403, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Wavelets for Classification In our methodological recommendations thus far, we have called on arguments of reliability, insensitivity to artifact, and decreased variability to support specific choices in wavelet-based functional network analysis. In a final analysis we further asked whether one can support these choices based on differential sensitivity to group differences in functional network architecture. In analyses based on scale 2 wavelet coefficients (corresponding to 0.06\u20130.125 Hz), the answer is clear: longer wavelet lengths provide increased sensitivity to group differences as measured both by parametric t-tests and non-parametric machine learning algorithms based on decision trees. Using these longer wavelets, we observe significantly greater classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values than those previously observed in this same data set, complementing prior work demonstrating differences in spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in BOLD signal and functional or structural network architecture between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Thus, in addition to their benefits in terms of sensitivity and robustness, longer wavelets offer greater sensitivity to group differences in this data set, supporting their choice in the performance of wavelet-based analyses of resting state fMRI data more broadly. We speculate that there might be some underlying structural difference between the two groups of subjects that is consistent among individuals, and that the longer wavelet lengths smooth small differences between individuals so that large-scale differences are clearer. More generally, we speculate that larger wavelet lengths are better able to distinguish group-level features, while shorter wavelets may better distinguish individual-level features.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41224, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Longer Wavelets and Vanishing Moments As mentioned earlier, wavelet methods offer significant advantages over bandpass filtering in terms of signal preservation and denoising. These capabilities are supported by the fact that wavelets have vanishing moments, the number of which is the maximum degree of the polynomials the scaling function can reproduce. Both Daubechies and Coiflet wavelets have p vanishing moments for lengths 2p. For denoising purposes, it has been suggested that the number of vanishing moments should be greater than 2H + 1 where H is the Hurst exponent. Preliminary evidence suggests that the Hurst exponent for fMRI noise lies below 1, suggesting that one might wish to use wavelets with at least 4 vanishing moments. In the Daubechies family, this would correspond to a wavelet of length 8, which is a length that our results also support as demonstrating particularly high reliability, decreased sensitivity to artifact, and decreased variability. However, in the context of other clinical or task data, these choices might be quite different. While these heuristics suggest a minimal number of vanishing moments, it is not as simple to define a maximal number of vanishing moments that should be considered. Evidence suggests that very large numbers of vanishing moments can lead to computational artifacts in the decomposed signal. However, the point at which these artifacts occur is difficult to predict for different data types.

However, this scale covers only a portion of the larger frequency range often interpreted in resting fMRI: 0.008\u20130.15Hz. This larger frequency range actually encompasses several wavelet scales at a TR of 2 s: scale 1 corresponding to 0.12\u20130.25 Hz, scale 2 corresponding to 0.06\u20130.12 Hz, scale 3 corresponding to 0.03\u20130.06 Hz, and scale 4 corresponding to 0.015\u20130.03 Hz. While here in the main text we focus on scale 2, in the SI we provide a detailed account of the structure of graphs constructed from scales 1, 3, and 4. The inclusion of these scales is supported by previous literature demonstrating their neurophysiological relevance in terms of graph construction and functional connectivity profiles. For example, there is extensive precedent for examining functional connectivity patterns in frequency ranges including but not limited to scale 2 (0.06\u20130.12 Hz), in particular dating back to some of the very earliest work roughly 10 years ago. In their very influential paper, Achard and colleagues demonstrated that functional networks obtained at rest displayed significant small-world structure in scales 1 through 6, in their data representing frequency bands covering 0.007\u20140.45 Hz. Since that seminal paper, others have demonstrated that graphs constructed from frequencies above the traditionally studied bands (e.g., 0.09\u20130.18 Hz) demonstrate greater heritability than graphs constructed from frequency bands below 0.09 Hz. However, while heritability of graph statistics might be greatest in high frequency bands, sensitivity to disease may be greatest in other bands. For example, Wang and colleagues demonstrate that resting state functional connectivity graphs in people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment are most different from healthy controls in the low frequency band 0.031\u20130.063 Hz.
