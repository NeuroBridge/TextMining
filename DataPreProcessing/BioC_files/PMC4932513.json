Functional neuroimaging has been used to assess differences in the mean strength of brain activity in smokers\u2019 brains, however less is known about the temporal dynamics within smokers\u2019 brains. Temporal dynamics is a key feature of a dynamic system such as the brain, and may carry information critical to understanding the brain mechanisms underlying cigarette smoking. We measured the temporal dynamics of brain activity using brain entropy (BEN) mapping and compared BEN between chronic non-deprived smokers and non-smoking controls. Because of the known sex differences in neural and behavioral smoking characteristics, comparisons were also made between males and females. Associations between BEN and smoking related clinical measures were assessed in smokers. Our data showed globally higher BEN in chronic smokers compared to controls. The escalated BEN was associated with more years of smoking in the right limbic area and frontal region. Female nonsmokers showed higher BEN than male nonsmokers in prefrontal cortex, insula, and precuneus, but the BEN sex difference in smokers was less pronounced.

We also found sex effects of resting BEN in non-smokers as well as in smokers, however the BEN difference between male and female smokers was markedly reduced than non-smokers. The altered resting BEN entropy patterns and the patterns related to smoking behavior provided new aspects of smoking-related brain alterations, helping to better understand the underlying neural mechanisms of nicotine dependence from a temporal dynamics perspective. This is different from the existing nicotine dependence resting state studies wherein the information gleaned reflects static functional connectivity or resting state network activity, i.e. the correlation between time series of different regions. As an alternative and additive method, BEN provides a method to characterize the temporal dynamics of the resting brain. The BEN mapping technique and our findings might provide new hints for developing effective approaches to treat cigarette dependence by targeting the irregularities of the fluctuating activity within the resting brain.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24598, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Additional Information", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24621, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "How to cite this article: Li, Z. et al.
