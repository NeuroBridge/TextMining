Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have found significant reductions in striatal dopamine D2 receptors, and blunted amphetamine-induced dopamine release, in substance users compared to healthy controls. Extant literature is limited and inconsistent concerning vulnerability associated with having a family history of substance abuse (FH+). Some studies have reported familial liability associated with higher dopamine receptor levels, reduced dopamine response to stimulant challenges and decreased response to oral alcohol. However other reports have failed to find group differences based on family history. We explored the interaction of familial liability and behavioral risk with multi-modal molecular and neural imaging of the dopaminergic system. Forty-four young adult male subjects performed monetary incentive delay tasks during both [11C]raclopride PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. FH+ subjects were identified as Low (n=24) or High Risk (n=9) based on early initiation of drunkenness. FH+ High Risk subjects exhibited heightened striatal dopamine response to monetary reward but did not differ in neural activations compared with FH+ Low Risk subjects and controls with no familial loading (FH-, n=11). Across all subjects, a negative relationship was found between dopamine release and age of first drunkenness and a positive relationship with neural response to reward receipt.

The significant question remains why the majority of youth transition through this period successfully while a subset remains vulnerable to development of substance use disorders. Concurrent to this period of experimentation, dopamine receptor concentrations, primarily in the striatum (including the nucleus accumbens, NAcc) reach peak levels. Critically, the mesolimbic dopamine system is hypothesized to play a role in addiction disorders, with blunted levels of dopamine D2 receptors and dopamine transmission associated with abuse of alcohol as well as stimulants.

Research has probed the how the dopaminergic system may be involved in familial risk using positron emission tomography (PET). For example, Volkow and colleagues found that non-alcoholic adult members of alcoholic families had higher dopamine D2 receptor availability in the caudate and ventral striatum than non-alcoholic controls, suggesting high levels of receptors might be a protective factor against alcohol problems in these individuals. More recently, enrolled young adults with a family history of substance use disorders (FH+) who reported occasional use of psychostimulants. These subjects had blunted stimulant-induced dopamine release compared to two groups of controls - no familial loading (FH-) subjects that were drug-na\u00efve and FH- subjects who matched the high-risk group on personal drug use though the groups did not differ on baseline receptor availability. Taken together, these studies suggest that for individuals with familial risk, high D2 receptor levels may be associated with resilience while reduced striatal dopamine release following a stimulant challenge might be a biomarker of vulnerability for substance use disorders. However, an earlier stimulant challenge study of nonalcoholic subjects found no effect of family history either on D2 receptor levels or dopamine release.

The current levels of alcohol consumption (\u223c12 drinks/week) are similar to those of the high-risk group in the alcohol challenge study (\u223c13 drinks/week) by. In fact, both the present study and that study lend support to a recent neurodevelopmental model of vulnerability to addiction presented by. This model hypothesizes that vulnerable individuals may have heightened responsivity to a variety of salient stimuli which may translate into risk-taking behaviors, including experimentation with drugs. If substance use is initiated and continued, this use would become associated with cues through conditioning and sensitization, eventually leading to accentuated response to drug-cues and attenuated response to non-drug rewards. In support of this model, Casey et al. has shown that current substance users had low dopamine release associated with an amphetamine challenges which had no drug cues present in contrast to the increased dopamine release associated with an alcohol challenge which involves multiple sensory cues associated with oral consumption. Given that none of our high-risk subjects have reached a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and analysis without the single subject with a marijuana dependence diagnosis had no effect on our findings, we would suggest that these subjects are still in the \u2018early\u2019 vulnerability stage where the reward system has not become conditioned to focus on drug cues. Continued longitudinal scans, which are ongoing in our sample, may potentially identify a transition in cue responding in those subjects who reach diagnosis in the future. In addition, our lack of group differences, either by family history or risk level, in binding levels during the control condition, while not the conventional method of measurement, may suggest that preexisting receptor levels are not contributing to risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27776, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to dopamine BPND and release, neural reward responsivity has also been investigated as a potential biomarker of risk. For example, our prior work reported blunted activation to reward anticipation in FH+ young adults with low levels of alcohol use compared with FH- young adults. However, FH+ young adults who were risky drinkers did not differ from FH- young adults matched on drinking, which suggests that blunted activation may be a resilience mechanisms in FH+. In a follow-up repeated measures analysis with a larger sample (n = 175; scans = 473), across a larger age range (8-27 years), we did not find an effect of family history but reported a quadratic association with age where adolescents displayed amplified striatal response which was related to later problem alcohol use.

This heterogeneity may be related not only to development, but also to variations in task design and analysis methods (Balodis and Potenza).

Other work using the MID in both PET and fMRI has reported a relationship between ventral striatal dopamine release and anticipatory accumbens activation with the suggestion that either local dopamine release may trigger local blood oxygenation level dependent signal or, conversely, be the consequence of increased neural activation. Given the larger sample size in this study (n=44) compared to Schott et al (n=14), it is interesting that we did not duplicate their finding. That study performed a regression between NAcc dopamine release and anticipatory response but not feedback response. Dependent on study design, there is often considerable collinearity and potential confound between the anticipatory and feedback responses. Other fMRI studies have demonstrated that feedback of performance activates the ventral striatum and, in fact, as opposed to the dorsal striatum, its activation is increased by feedback when a monetary incentive in present. Removal of a monetary incentive leads to a significant drop in activation suggesting that feedback itself may serve as a task intrinsic reward. As dopamine release during a video game has been shown to positively correlate with task performance, our study importantly links ventral striatal dopamine release with neural response to feedback. This may be a step in understanding the mechanisms of intrinsically motivated behaviors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30718, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It is important to acknowledge that, in contrast to our original study of the MID task to induce dopamine release, we did not see a strong effect of task in this study.

For several methodological reasons - including age range, familial liability, different versions of the fMRI task, etc. - these groups are not easily compared. We note, however, that other work has demonstrated greater dopamine release in many regions of the brain (with the exception of the dorsal striatum) in women. The fact that the task effect was highly significant in the High Risk group may support the use of behaviorally-induced dopamine release as a potential biomarker, particularly in male subjects.
