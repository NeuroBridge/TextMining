We aimed to determine the extent to which elevated peripheral cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression: (1) characterizes a subgroup of people with schizophrenia and (2) shows a relationship to cognition, brain volume and/or symptoms. Forty-three outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and matched healthy controls were assessed for peripheral cytokine mRNAs (interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-18), intelligence quotient, memory and verbal fluency, symptom severity and cortical brain volumes integral to language (that is, Broca's and Wernicke's areas). IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels were 28% increased in schizophrenia compared with controls (t(82)=2.64, P<0.01). Using a two-step clustering procedure, we identified a subgroup of people displaying relatively elevated cytokine mRNA levels (17/43 people with schizophrenia and 9/42 controls). Individuals with schizophrenia in the elevated cytokine subgroup performed significantly worse than the low-cytokine subgroup on verbal fluency (F(1,40)=15.7, P<0.001). There was a 17% volume reduction of the left pars opercularis (POp) (Broca's area) in patients with elevated cytokines compared with patients with lower cytokines (F(1,29)=9.41, P=0.005). Negative linear relationships between IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels and both verbal fluency and left POp volume were found in schizophrenia. This study is among the first to link blood biomarkers of inflammation with both cognitive deficits and brain volume reductions in people with schizophrenia, supporting that those with elevated cytokines represent a neurobiologically meaningful subgroup.

Plausible causative pathways may involve early (prenatal) activation of the immune system and/or abnormal immune responses contributing to the ongoing pathophysiology of schizophrenia, which are supported by epidemiological observations, animal models, post-mortem brain research and clinical studies. Group comparisons of peripheral circulating cytokines (signaling peptides of the immune system mediating the inflammation response) between individuals with schizophrenia and controls have consistently identified higher mean levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines in schizophrenia and even greater elevations during acute psychosis.

Similarly to Alzheimer's disease, individuals with schizophrenia, as a group, are known to show significantly poorer performance on many cognitive domains, including COWAT verbal fluency. Of particular interest with regards to impaired verbal fluency in schizophrenia are structural and functional changes in Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have found abnormal cortical folding and decreased volumes in schizophrenia compared with controls.

The individuals with schizophrenia in the elevated versus low-cytokine group were on average 4 years older. Cytokine protein levels in the blood, with the possible exception of IL-1\u03b2, are known to increase with age. As only IL-8 mRNA levels showed a statistically significant relationship with age in our patients, the age difference between the elevated and low-cytokine groups appears unlikely to have unduly influenced our results. Finally, it is possible that patients with more exaggerated cortical pathology and worse verbal fluency are more likely to have inflammatory changes in their blood owing to years of unremitting illness and to systematic differences in lifestyle factors like changes in diet, exercise and sleep, which could independently be associated with increases in markers of inflammation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27267, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The challenges of determining to what extent blood biomarkers vary across the course of the illness and in response to factors such as antipsychotic exposure and symptom status emphasize the importance of studying the relationship of brain structural changes, clinical features and blood biomarkers of inflammation using a longitudinal design that includes the prodrome, first-episode psychosis and acute relapses.

The main boundary between peripheral circulation and the brain is the blood\u2013brain barrier, which may be disrupted in the elevated cytokine schizophrenia group as can be found in other inflammatory conditions. Increased IL-1\u03b2 leads to the induction of Nitric Oxide Synthase through activation of IL-1\u03b2 receptors on brain vascular cells and the subsequent production of diffusible NO. Thus, elevated IL-1\u03b2 in the periphery could cause blood\u2013brain barrier disruption and change the active transport of cytokines across the blood\u2013brain barrier, which may result in increased immune system communication between blood and brain in people with schizophrenia compared with controls. The present study was not designed to identify molecular mechanisms through which inflammation may mediate decreases in brain volumes, although we speculate that the mechanisms may be similar to those that cause cellular damage by peripheral chronic inflammation in other diseases (for review see). An interesting possibility is that increased peripheral inflammation leads to changes in tryptophan metabolism, resulting in increased kynurenine that can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, be converted to quinolinic acid and lead to neurotoxicity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29273, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Some individuals with an elevated cytokine expression pattern are also found in the healthy control group. This finding is not unexpected as slightly increased or chronic immune activation can be found because of a variety of causes that were not used as exclusion criteria in our study, including allergies, asthma or arthritis. This demonstrates that falling into the 'elevated cytokine' category as defined here is not in itself sufficient to cause schizophrenia. Rather it would appear that a specific type of brain-based susceptibility to immune activation may be needed to trigger the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Indeed, we have found evidence for the involvement of cytokines in the molecular and cellular neuropathology in people with schizophrenia with an elevated cytokine subgroup of people with schizophrenia found in two post-mortem cohorts.
