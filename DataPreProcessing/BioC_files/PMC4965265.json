However, its formulation assumes that the measured brain signals are generated by a linear mixture of the underlying brain networks and this assumption limits its ability to detect the inherent nonlinear nature of brain interactions. In this paper, we introduce nonlinear independent component estimation (NICE) to structural MRI data to detect abnormal patterns of gray matter concentration in schizophrenia patients. For this biomedical application, we further addressed the issue of model regularization of nonlinear ICA by performing dimensionality reduction prior to NICE, together with an appropriate control of the complexity of the model and the usage of a proper approximation of the probability distribution functions of the estimated components. We show that our results are consistent with previous findings in the literature, but we also demonstrate that the incorporation of nonlinear associations in the data enables the detection of spatial patterns that are not identified by linear ICA.

However, component 4 for the 20-dimension data reduction seems not to be driven as strongly as the other one by embedded nonlinearities. For the new data reduction scheme, ICA still estimates a component spanning the superior temporal gyrus and another one that covers the frontal gyrus, though not on the same location. When compared to NICE, it can be seen that NICE component 4 and ICA component 2 both cover the inferior frontal gyrus. Therefore, it can be argued that NICE detects more components associated to disease than ICA for either setting of dimensionality reduction.

After RBM data reduction ICA is able to capture abnormal tissue concentration in the cerebellum, which is consistent with NICE findings. In addition, ICA is still capable of detecting the regions covered by ICA component 1 with PCA reduction.

This finding is consistent with the patterns of decreased GMC reported in different meta-analysis of MRI studies of schizophrenia,,. It is also interesting to note that while this component has been replicated in other ICA studies of sMRI,, NICE also incorporates the parahipoccampal gyrus when the data is reduced to 30 dimensions via PCA.

As it was discussed in Section VIII, components 2 and 4 seem to be strongly influenced by the nonlinearities induced by NICE for PCA reduction to 30 dimensions, an argument that seems to be reinforced by the fact that these components were not detected by ICA. Nonetheless, NICE component 4 after reduction to 20 principal components seems to be less influenced by the nonlinearities embedded in the model. Similarly, it can be argued that component 2 (after PCA reduction) was detected due to the nonlinearities induced by NICE as spatial independence between all of the components is enforced. Alternatively, it may be possible that this component has not been found as consistently as others such as the one spanning the superior temporal gyrus in ICA-based studies, as the basal ganglia was shown to estimate group differences in. Equally important is the finding of another subcortical region such as the thalamus when the data is reduced by means of an RBM. In this case, components 1 and 2 suggest a reduction of GMC in this region. Given that the thalamus plays a crucial role in the coordination of information between brain regions, abnormal structural patterns in the thalamus would explain some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Overall, it seems like nonlinear dependencies between inputs and outputs are present in all components, but some are influenced by stronger nonlinearities.

Regarding the specific case of sMRI data, the regularization could impose a lower bound on the size of connected clusters in each component or enforce a certain degree of correlation between neighboring pixels for the estimated components.
