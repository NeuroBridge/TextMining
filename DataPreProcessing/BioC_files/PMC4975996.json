Indeed, national estimates indicate that rates of substance use during adolescence climb steadily from 20 to 70% between 12 and 17 years of age. Of great concern is that substance use such as alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and other illicit drugs often increases the risk of dependency, unprotected intercourse, and interpersonal violence, leading to adverse health outcomes later in life. Developmental neuroscience research suggests that the increased risky behaviors including substance use in adolescence are due, in part, to imbalanced developmental trajectories of brain circuits between the subcortical limbic and prefrontal networks (; see also), and thus adolescents exhibit heightened emotional impulsivity and a lack of effective cognitive control, resulting in greater substance use behaviors. Therefore, investigating the neural underpinnings associated with substance use is critical to reduce risk of substance use and increase protective factors for adolescents.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2200, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A growing body of literature in developmental neuroscience provides considerable evidence that functional coupling between limbic and prefrontal systems plays an important role in emotion regulation and risk-taking behavior during adolescence, contributing to substance use. For example, functional MRI (fMRI) studies using task-based indexes of functional brain activation have demonstrated a developmental shift in functional connectivity between limbic and prefrontal circuitry, such that children show positive coupling, which switches to negative coupling by adulthood. Thus, negative functional coupling between these circuitries is an index of maturation of neural networks of the brain, representing enhanced inhibitory projections from frontal to limbic regions. Consistently, a recent longitudinal fMRI study highlighted inverse connectivity between limbic and prefrontal systems by demonstrating that adolescents who show longitudinal declines in functional coupling between the ventral striatum (VS), a region in the limbic system, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region in the prefrontal, executive system, exhibited greater decreases in risk-taking behavior over time. Tract-tracing studies in rodents further supports this view by showing that an inverse association between these two systems is derived from greater suppression of limbic activity via descending projections from the prefrontal region, which increasingly emerges over development. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies in humans have further demonstrated the importance of functional connectivity and links to adolescent behavior. For example, higher positive functional connectivity between limbic and prefrontal circuits is associated with hyperresponsiveness and overvaluation of rewards, behaviors which contribute to higher frequency of substance-use behavior in adolescents. Indeed, a recent rs-fMRI study demonstrated that positive resting-state functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal regions was related to earlier substance use. Similarly, adolescents with a family history of alcoholism showed less negative connectivity between NAcc and other executive control regions including the inferior frontal gyrus and ventrolateral PFC. In sum, these findings suggest that inverse or segregated limbic-prefrontal connectivity is related to decreased risky-behaviors during adolescence", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4613, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given previous evidence indicating developmental maturity of the brain can be indexed by the degree of inverse functional coupling between limbic and PFC systems, representing the enhanced top-down inhibitory processing of the prefrontal system over the heavier bottom-up signaling from the limbic system, the main goal of current study was to investigate the behavioral outcomes of functional connectivity between these two systems using rs-fMRI. rs-fMRI can provide a novel framework for investigating the functional systems in the large-scale organization of the developing brain in adolescents, independent of stimulus-induced brain activity usually driven by either experimental demands or participants\u2019 cognitive and emotional tendencies. In particular, we sought to provide a novel functional network-level account of adolescent brain connectivity associated with substance-use behavior by using independent component analysis (ICA) focusing on between-network coupling. Previous evidence has demonstrated that independent networks with opposing functions (e.g., top-down inhibitory processing of the prefrontal system versus bottom-up processing of the limbic system) are more likely to show an inverse correlation (i.e., negative connectivity at between-network level). Most importantly, this inverse coupling between opposite functional networks increases with age while sub-region connectivity strength increases in each functional network (i.e., positive connectivity at within-network level) as a result of enhanced efficiency in between- and within-network communication. Although prior work has found limbic-prefrontal functional connectivity plays a role in adolescents\u2019 sensitivity to rewards and substance-use behaviors (e.g.,), the approach they used was seed-based ROI which does not necessarily distinguish between whether the connectivity metric in certain paired voxels or regions is due to either between- or within network involvement. It is difficult to disentangle whether the source of the connectivity valence between seed regions (e.g., amygdala or VS) and their pairwise regions of interest (e.g., mPFC or dorsolateral PFC; dlPFC) is derived from either between- or within-network. Given the difficulty of evaluating the network level of brain systems (i.e., between- and within network connectivity), ICA holds several advantages over the seed-based approach in rs-fMRI. First, ICA identifies functional networks distinctly using spatial independence. By taking into account multiple simultaneous voxel-by-voxel time-course dynamics, ICA can decompose data into a linear mixture of spatially independent and temporally coherent course signals that are usually intermingled within a given voxel which would be indistinguishable in a conventional seed-based approach, and thus ICA can provide insight into whole-brain functional systems independently for both within- and between-network connectivity without a priori hypotheses for a specific seed-region. Furthermore, ICA requires no a priori specification of non-resting state network relevant signal variability such as global signal fluctuation and noise such as physiological dynamics and head movement that commonly arises in seed-based correlation approach and leads to signal quality changes (e.g., Power et al., 2012) because an ICA characterizes individual-level spatiotemporal dynamics of each brain network by multiple regressions while controlling for the influence of other networks and sources of variability (e.g., noise and global signal). In addition to the analytic aspect of ICA described above, ICA is relatively unaffected by different temporal sampling rates (see) thereby increasing flexibility in use of multiple datasets collected from multiple sites and scan protocols (e.g.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8399, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given the network level approach of using ICA, we were particularly interested in examining between-functional resting-state network (RSN) connectivity between the limbic and right fronto-parietal networks (FPN). The limbic network broadly includes amygdala, VS, primary olfactory, limbic associated cortices (BA 28/34/35/36/38), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), thalamus and basal ganglia (BG), and is involved in emotional and autonomic processes for reward, fear, and anxiety, indicating that this network represents the brain system for bottom-up emotional processing. The right FPN composes of dlPFC, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and midcingulate on the right side of brain and is well known for its strong involvement in multiple top-down cognitive control processes that require continuous attentional monitoring, response inhibition, and control.

The transition to mid adolescence (e.g., 13\u201317 years) is a developmental period marked by steep increases in risky behavior and poor self-control.

Thus, the segregation into negatively valenced connectivity between the fronto-parietal and limbic networks among non-substance users in the current study may therefore reflect increasing sophistication of functional coupling between these networks as the brain matures throughout adolescence. Our findings are consistent with prior resting-state studies. For instance, Weissman and colleagues (2015) used seed-based resting-state analyses and found that earlier substance use onset was associated with greater positive coupling between the bilateral nucleus accumbens and regions of the FPN. Similarly, Cservenka and colleagues (2014) used seed-based resting state analyses and found that adolescents at risk for substance use (i.e., history of family alcoholism) showed less negative connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC).

Indeed, previous studies have shown that adults with impaired right FPN have a deficit in cognitive tasks such as the Stroop and Go/No-Go task requiring executive function of inhibition and control.

For example, found that limbic-prefrontal positive connectivity was associated with enhanced impulse control using a delayed discounting decision task. Similarly, have implicated that resting-state connectivity between amygdala and mPFC increases with age (i.e., stronger positive connectivity). These seemingly contradictory findings are not unexpected. First, as noted by He (2013), the evoked- and intrinsic neural connectivity interact in unpredictable ways, and the valence of connectivity is possible to be reversed between them. Furthermore, spontaneous BOLD signal can be evoked differently by different cognitive demands of task-based approaches, which can alter the valence of connectivity associated with the narrowed power distribution across frequencies. Second, resting-state connectivity can be differentiated depending on the analytic approach (seed vs. ICA) or the connectivity metric (within- and between network). While independent networks with opposing functions are more likely to show more negative valence of connectivity (i.e., between-network level), sub-region connectivity strength in each functional network can increase regardless of its connectivity direction (i.e., valence) at the same time as a result of enhanced efficiency in between- and within-network communication. For example, previous evidence has demonstrated that inverse coupling between opposite functional networks increases with age, whereas sub-region connectivity strength within given networks increases. Therefore, the reversed valence but increased connectivity strength (magnitude) between amygdala-mPFC connectivity in the study of might be due to the within-network observation rather than between-network given the nature of seed-based approach which cannot distinguish connectivity metrics (i.e., within- and between networks).

However, given the nature of the correlative approach in functional connectivity, the metric per se is not necessarily straightforward in terms of positive and negative value from the absolute zero point because functional connectivity is more about how much neural signals in certain voxels (or networks) fluctuate together (i.e., positive correlation) or reversely (i.e., negative-, inverse- or anti correlation) with neural signals in other voxels (or networks).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30530, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our analyses focused on the limbic network connectivity with the right FPN and its influence on self-control in adolescents.

For example, the SN is involved in the detection of salient stimuli and can initiate the attentional control system of the brain by decreasing the connectivity between DMN and CEN transiently (for a comprehensive review, see). That is, the moment-by-moment connectivity changes between different networks play an importance role in enhancement for cognitive and attentional control in the human brain system.

First, we cannot determine whether the functional connectivity patterns preceded and contributed to substance use-behaviors and cognitive control, or vice versa given our correlational analysis and cross-sectional sample. However, it is plausible to interpret that less risky behavior is a result of increased prefrontal inhibitory process in the limbic system (i.e., inverse functional coupling), and our regression model using mediation supported this pathway (i.e., model 1). In our other model using substance-use-onset as the independent variable to predict functional connectivity or self-control, we failed to find any mediation effects, increasing confidence that the observed less substance use was derived from the effect of inverse functional coupling between top-down and bottom-up networks combined with heightened self-control, and not vice versa. Also, because we focused on adolescents using a cross-sectional approach, and adults\u2019 substance-use behavior was not collected in the current study, it is not clear whether the current findings may vary across larger developmental groups and how resting state connectivity patterns change developmentally to predict substance use behaviors. Second, we only used self-report measures of adolescents\u2019 behavior, and thus our assessment might be a suboptimal method to measure self-control and risky behavior compared to experimental based assessments in the laboratory such as the balloon analog risk task (e.g.,) and Go-NoGo task (e.g.,), which measure risk-taking behavior and cognitive control, respectively.
