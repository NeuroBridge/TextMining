Our stimulant and non-stimulant groups did differ on levels of non-stimulant substance use; although our results were substantively the same after covarying total years of non-stimulant substance abuse, there may be differences in poly-drug users above and beyond the duration of such use. It is worth noting that comorbid substance use is common in stimulant users. Thus, despite potential complicating effects of poly-drug use, our sample of stimulant users is highly representative of the stimulant using population. Another potential limitation was that our measure of duration did not account for the amount of the drugs used. Although previous research indicates that the duration measure of stimulant use can have meaningful correlates in the brain (i.e.,, 2013) this may not have adequately quantified severity of use.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26208, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, regular stimulant users demonstrated abnormal neural activity during moral processing in fronto-limbic regions. Specifically, lifetime regular stimulant users had hypoactivation in the amygdala, while duration of stimulant use was related to decreased ACC engagement. These results correspond to the fronto-limbic moral processing system, suggesting that stimulant users may have impairment in regions in this system. This is the first study to suggest impairments in the neural systems of moral processing in both cocaine and methamphetamine users. Although further research into the connectivity of systems in stimulant use is needed, this provides promising initial understanding of fronto-limbic deficits in stimulant users.", "sentences": [],
