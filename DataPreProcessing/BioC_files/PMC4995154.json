While this notion became prevalent and received considerable discussion (see, e.g.,), thus far there has been no direct evidence to support it. Jansma and colleagues did observe a reduction in activation in DLPFC in patients from a 2-back to a 3-back load of the n-back task, but their finding has not been replicated in the very large literature using n-back tasks, was carried out with only 10 participants in each group, included error trials, and no inverted-U was observed in healthy participants. We propose that the failure thus far to demonstrate the hypothesized inverted-U may be due to the relative coarseness of the WM load manipulations allowed by commonly used WM tasks, such as the n-back and Sternberg tasks, where a limited number of steps limits the ability of the task to demonstrate an inverted-U. Consequently, we adapted the Self-Ordered WM Task (SOT), a classic neuropsychological test of DLPFC function, for use with fMRI. Our version of the task allows for a gradual increase in WM load from 0 to 7 items in a single trial, and SOT performance correlates with performance on a visual change detection task, the gold standard for estimating visual WM capacity.

These were averaged within each cluster to produce a scalar value for each participant in each cluster, which was then related to WM capacity in a step-forward linear regression model selection framework (see supplement).

The resulting model demonstrated independent contributions to WM capacity from a) the inverted-U fit in the smaller left prefrontal cortex region, which behaved very similarly to the larger DLPFC cluster (see below), and was positively associated with WM capacity; b) precuneus, in which activation was positively associated with WM capacity; and c) the suppression of activation in mPFC, where activation was negatively associated with WM capacity in patients (but not controls).

Rather, the flattening or blunting of the inverted-U observed here was proposed later, to explain findings of a reduced load-activation slope in patients relative to controls, although no inverted-U was observed directly in that study. Second, patients demonstrated a relative failure to deactivate mPFC during WM task performance, which was also associated with greater deficits in WM capacity among patients with schizophrenia. This failure to deactivate portions of the so-called default-mode network by patients with schizophrenia has been widely reported, although we are aware of only one prior report linking deactivation of this region to WM task performance, in healthy individuals (but not patients; 43). Finally, activation in medial visual cortex (precuneus) was both significantly increased in schizophrenia and positively associated with WM capacity. Critically, multiple regression indicated an independent role for each of these three mechanisms in WM deficits.

While the present results cannot speak directly to the molecular underpinnings of WM deficits in schizophrenia, and would certainly benefit from replication, here we report a direct connection between DLPFC dysfunction and WM deficits in schizophrenia in a clinical sample. Critically, this dysfunction does not come in the form of simply increased or decreased activation, but rather in a more subtle alteration of an activation pattern associated with strong WM capacity across diagnostic groups, which can (presumably) only be elucidated under conditions that allow for fine-grained manipulation of WM load over a broad WM loads; namely, a failure to show a robust inverted-U relationship between WM load and activation in left DLPFC. This has important implications for future work, which will be needed to better understand how this functional alteration in inverted-U activation in DLPFC operates in clinical samples and animal models, and which could potentially identify new targets for treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. That is, the overwhelming majority of WM tasks that have been used to probe WM in both clinical and basic research employ at most two or three WM loads, which is likely insufficient to characterize the inverted-U activation pattern (or lack thereof) shown to be associated with WM capacity in the present study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22156, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A critical unresolved question relates to the functional significance of the inverted-U observed in healthy controls, which we have discussed at some length elsewhere.

Moreover, the positive association between the inverted-U pattern and WM capacity observed also suggests that this activation pattern is adaptive. Although we are at present unable to definitively adjudicate between competing possibilities, in general terms it seems most likely that the inverted-U reflects an adaptive shift in cognitive strategy that patients (or at least many patients) fail to engage. For example, as we have argued elsewhere, participants may gradually shift from a WM-mediated to a long-term memory mediated strategy that requires less reliance on active maintenance. In this case, the failure by patients to exhibit this neural response could reflect inefficient strategy use, direct impairment to the WM system that limits the extent of DLPFC activation (thereby flattening the inverted-U), impairment in long-term memory that renders a strategy switch maladaptive, or impairment in whatever mechanism initiates such a switch.

We also observed a region of the precuneus which was activated more by patients with schizophrenia than healthy controls, but which also showed a positive association between activation and WM capacity.

Without such a link (even one that is only correlational), observations such as the widely reported reduction in activation of DLPFC during WM task performance in patients with schizophrenia are difficult to interpret. If such a reduction is not clearly linked to poorer performance, which it is not in the large majority of the literature, it cannot be concluded that such a finding is related to cognitive deficits or WM impairment; indeed, it could be epiphenomenal to some other disease process that is not relevant to the process being studied. Here we observed no relationship between the overall level of activation in DLPFC and WM capacity in either healthy individuals or patients with schizophrenia, consistent with the literature, although the pattern of activation across loads within DLPFC was predictive of capacity. This is suggestive of a dynamic process that may depend more on the ability to flexibly alter the neural processes brought to bear on a behavioral goal in the course of a single trial than it does on the ability to produce a large increase in BOLD signal in a region thought to carry out executive control processes. In our view, the field should strive to move away from simply describing alterations in BOLD signal in patient samples, and attempt to rigorously characterize biomarkers of WM or other cognitive deficits, such as those described here. Once a biomarker has been established, and ideally replicated, researchers can then attempt to characterize other cognitive, neural, molecular, or genetic mechanisms associated with the biomarker and ultimately attempt to identify interventions (pharmacological or otherwise) that target the biomarker and could potentially produce improvements in WM or other cognitive deficits.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26959, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As a final note, it is important to bear in mind that our two patient samples were identified more naturalistically than experimentally. Our unmedicated group consisted of psychiatrically stable outpatients who either refuse to take medications or were off medications for reasons unrelated to this study. Thus, they represent a population that is distinct from our medicated sample in ways that extend beyond medication status, and so any differences (or similarities) cannot necessarily be attributed to the medications per se. For example, the close correspondence in overall symptomatology between the two groups (see Table 1) strongly suggests that our unmedicated sample is more mildly psychotic than our medicated sample. Similarly, there was considerable suggestive (i.e. trend-level) evidence that the medicated group may have performed more poorly on the SOT than unmedicated patients. While, if real, this could plausibly be an effect of antipsychotic medications, it could also reflect more serious impairment in the medicated group. Thus, while the lack of differences between patient groups in any of our neural outcome measures or the observed relationships between neural outcomes and WM capacity suggests that the phenomenon under consideration are not strongly impacted by antipsychotic medication, it remains possible that these medications do exert important influences that have been missed here as a result of other systematic differences between these two groups.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28446, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28469, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Financial Disclosures", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28491, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Dr Girgis has received research support from Otsuka, Genentech, and Pharmanac.
