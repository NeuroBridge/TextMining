This involved comparing the eigenvalues from the PCA of the stacked, single trial EEG data correlation matrix to eigenvalues from a PCA of a thousand completely simulated random normal data matrices of equal rank. A 95% cutoff, derived from the simulated data eigenvalue distribution, was used to determine how many components to extract from the EEG data. All subjects had 3, 4, or 5 components with eigenvalues exceeding this cut-off, and neither the number of components (HC: 3.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.737, SZ: 3.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.602; t(64)\u00a0=\u00a00.9686, p\u00a0=\u00a00.3364), nor the percentage of variance explained by those selected components (HC: 91.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7%, SZ: 92.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8%; t(64)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.74, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0824) significantly differed between groups. ICA was then performed on each subject's single trial EEG data in EEGLAB with initial PCA dimension reduction (i.e. number of components to extract from EEG) set according to the previous estimate. Two researchers independently inspected individual component properties (i.e. fronto-central N100-P200 spatial loading, auditory evoked potential time course of ERP average from the component's single trial epochs, and 1/f power spectrum) to identify ERP-related independent components (ICs) and to exclude artifact-related ICs, and then they conferred to achieve consensus on which ICs to retain. Data from 13 (5 HC, 8 SZ) subjects were dropped from further analysis because zero components were selected (i.e. none of the ICs satisfied the criteria used to identify EEG/ERP ICs). The mean framewise displacement in this group of 13 participants suggested significantly greater mean motion values (median\u00a0=\u00a00.1656) than the 53 participants included in the analysis (median\u00a0=\u00a00.0856) using a Wilcoxon rank sum test (Z\u00a0=\u00a03.466, W\u00a0=\u00a0651, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005).

Our approach is similar to the CCA method described by others, with some important differences. The method is based on the concepts that true EEG data tend to show high auto-correlation and exhibit power-law scaling (i.e., power is proportional to 1/frequency), but that high frequency random noise in EEG (e.g., muscle artifact, electromyographic (EMG)) tends to show low auto-correlation and violates power-law scaling (i.e., inappropriately high power at higher frequencies relative to low frequencies). The CCA de-noising procedure is performed separately for each subject on the single trial EEG epoch data. For each 1500\u00a0ms epoch sampled at 250\u00a0Hz, the (S\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0X) matrix containing the time series of S\u00a0=\u00a0375 EEG amplitude values (s1, s2, s3 \u2026s375) at each of X\u00a0=\u00a031 scalp electrodes (x1, x2, x3\u2026x31) is subjected to a CCA with the (S\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Y) matrix containing the s\u00a0+\u00a01 time-lagged series of 375 EEG amplitude values (s2, s3, s4 \u2026s375, s376, where s376\u00a0=\u00a00) at each of the same 31 electrodes (y1, y2, y3\u2026y31). This is the multivariate equivalent of auto-regressive time series correlation. Since both the X and Y vectors each contain 31 electrodes, a total of 31 independent canonical correlations can be extracted. Each canonical correlation coefficient expresses the correlation of a time series of values representing the weighted sums of the X electrodes with a s\u00a0+\u00a01 time series of values representing the weighted sums of the Y electrodes, with weights chosen to yield the largest canonical correlation that accounts for variance independent of the variance accounted for by all previously extracted canonical correlations. Thus, each canonical correlation coefficient has an associated time series of values that constitutes the canonical variate, X (i.e. each time point has a value that is a linear function of the canonical weights and raw data associated with the 31 electrodes), as well as a similar canonical variate, Y. The current CCA de-noising method only makes use of the set of 31 canonical X variates, one for each of the 31 extracted canonical correlations. When the time series represented by a canonical variate is subjected to a fast Fourier transformation (FFT), the resulting power spectrum can be evaluated to determine whether the canonical variate conforms to the power-law expected from EEG data, in which case it should be retained, or whether it violates the power law as would be expected for high-frequency noise (e.g. EMG contamination), in which case it should be excluded. With this approach, the retained canonical variates are those showing the strongest canonical correlations, whereas the rejected canonical variates are those showing the weakest canonical correlations. The specific criterion used to make these retain/reject decisions is where our CCA denoising approach differs from previously published approaches (e.g.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48187, "infons": {"section_type": "APPENDIX", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previously described CCA denoising approaches have made decisions about which canonical variates to retain or reject by taking the ratio of high frequency (e.g. 15 to 30\u00a0Hz) to low frequency (e.g. <\u00a015\u00a0Hz) power, rejecting canonical variates with ratios greater than a pre-determined limit (e.g. if high/low\u00a0>\u00a01/5 in). Such ratios provide a very rough heuristic for determining whether a canonical variate's power spectrum has power-law scaling (i.e. 1/f\u03b2 or f\u03b1, where \u2212\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b1) where log-transformed power decreases linearly with increasing log-transformed frequency. Previous studies have suggested that the power-law exponent, \u03b1, which corresponds to the slope of the linear regression of log-power on log-frequency, is \u2212\u00a01 or less for human EEG, whereas white noise or EMG has an exponent of approximately zero. In order to develop a precise and conservative criterion for deciding which canonical variates to retain, we used simple linear regression to estimate \u03b1 by regressing log-power on log-frequency. However, rather than running this regression once using all of the available log power and log frequency values obtained from the FFT of the canonical variate, thereby yielding a single estimate of \u03b1 that could be unduly influenced by contamination from a few frequencies (e.g. 60\u00a0Hz or alpha band), a bootstrap procedure was used to generate a distribution of \u03b1 estimates. Specifically, for each canonical variate and each trial epoch, the linear regression of log-power on log-frequency used to estimate \u03b1 was repeated 1000 times by randomly sampling, without replacement, half of the frequency bins between 1 and 125\u00a0Hz from the FFT. If the distribution of 1000 \u03b1 estimates, which constitutes a 99.9% bootstrap confidence interval for \u03b1, contains a value of \u2212\u00a01 or smaller, then the canonical variate was retained, whereas if the smallest value in the bootstrap distribution is greater than \u2212\u00a01, the canonical variate is rejected. All rejected canonical variates are then algebraically removed during back-projection to the original EEG epoch space, generating a de-noised EEG epoch.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50284, "infons": {"section_type": "APPENDIX", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Joint independent analysis components that were not subjected to group or correlation analyses", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50379, "infons": {"section_type": "APPENDIX", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Three of the five joint ICs were not included in group comparisons and correlation analyses based on the criteria described in the main text.
