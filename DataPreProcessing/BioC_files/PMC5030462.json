Few previous studies have addressed globus pallidus volume laterality or made a direct comparison of left- and right-side volumes, although, contradictory to our results, some previous studies have reported enlarged globus pallidus volumes only on the right side in schizophrenia. van Erp et al. demonstrated a bilaterally increased volume of the globus pallidus in schizophrenia with similar effect sizes for both left and right regions, while not investigating the volume lateralization of this region. We presume no lateralization differences between groups in their data set. Of note, our results were likely not owing to a technical pitfall or instability of the current imaging analysis technology, because the additional analysis using FSL found similar results to the main analysis using FreeSurfer. Thus, schizophrenia\u2013control differences in the lateralization of globus pallidus volume could be robust.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25872, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several reports of left globus pallidus abnormalities in schizophrenia using imaging modalities other than structural MRI. A positron emission tomography study showed significantly higher blood flow in the left globus pallidus in never-medicated patients with schizophrenia than in controls. Another positron emission tomography study revealed a correlation between the severity of negative symptoms and increased left external globus pallidus activation in schizophrenia. A functional MRI study showed that patients with schizophrenia demonstrated greater activation during procedural learning in the left globus pallidus. Further, some previous investigations have shown altered connectivity involving the globus pallidus in schizophrenia. A resting-state functional MRI study revealed significantly aberrant interhemispheric connections in the globus pallidus, as well as a negative correlation with bilateral connections of the pallidum and duration of illness in schizophrenia. Finally, a diffusion tensor imaging study showed that patients with schizophrenia have lower-than-normal fractional anisotropy values in the bilateral globus pallidus, implying aberrant microstructures of the globus pallidus.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27091, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The basal ganglia have important roles in motor function and the reward system, and the globus pallidus externus is in the central position among the loop circuits of the basal ganglia. It has long been known that the basal ganglia use modulatory systems to regulate cerebral cortical activity via a projection to the thalamus. A recent mouse study described a direct GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acidergic) projection from the globus pallidus externus to the frontal cortex, which is exclusively ipsilateral and sensitive to antipsychotic drugs. These results imply the existence of altered structural and functional connectivity, especially ipsilateral connectivity, between basal ganglia and frontal cortices in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, altered GABAergic interneuron function resulting in dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is closely associated with impairments in executive functioning such as working memory, may occur ipsilaterally. Thus, it is suggested that there may be aberrant laterality in neural pathways and connectivity patterns related to the globus pallidus in schizophrenia. Further research is required to elucidate this hypothesis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28289, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A few limitations to the current study should be noted. First, possible effects of medically prescribed drugs on subcortical regional volumes in patients with schizophrenia cannot be overlooked. Although few studies reported associations between limbic volumes and antipsychotic medications, several studies have demonstrated increased basal ganglia volume after treatment with neuroleptics (especially typical neuroleptics). A review by Ebdrup et al., however, revealed that typical neuroleptics do not increase the volume of the basal ganglia, while atypical neuroleptics do. A recent meta-analytic study revealed no significant longitudinal differences in caudate volume related to antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia. Thus, results regarding medication-induced changes in subcortical regional volumes in schizophrenia remain controversial and heterogeneous. Second, the results of any meta-analysis must be interpreted cautiously, because of possible confounds such as a statistical paradox. The sample sizes of this study were unequal; therefore, the current meta-analytic results may be unstable. Third, we did not investigate correlations between subcortical region volumes and clinical characteristics. Only the Osaka site was able to provide such detailed clinical characteristics. The ENIGMA consortium has already launched a research project studying such associations. The Osaka site supplied its own data set of T1-weighted images and clinical information to this ENIGMA project.

Further, we revealed leftward asymmetry for thalamus, lateral ventricle, caudate and putamen volumes, and rightward asymmetry for amygdala and hippocampal volumes both in controls and in patients with schizophrenia. Also, we demonstrated schizophrenia-specific leftward asymmetry in globus pallidus volume.
