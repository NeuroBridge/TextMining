For tobacco smokers, these cues have been associated with the rewarding effects of nicotine, signal the potential end of withdrawal symptoms, and have the ability to motivate continued drug use. Thus, it is unsurprising that cortical brain regions involved in self-relevant processing show enhanced activity when smokers view such cues. A meta-analysis showed that brain regions typically reactive to smoking cues include the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) extending into the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and the precuneus (PrC) extending into the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).

Some evidence suggests that cortical midline glutamate (Glu) may play a role in regulating DMN suppression during externally focused cognition. Specifically, a high level of Glu in the PCC/precuneus is associated with reduced task-related DMN suppression. Further, dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) Glu may modulate task-related activity in regions of the DMN during cognitive control. This concept is consistent with nicotine dependence research as the smoking cessation therapy varenicline not only facilitated DMN suppression during externally focused cognition, but also reduced dACC Glu. The relationship between dACC Glu and DMN activity is particularly relevant considering the fact that the dACC is a primary hub of the salience network (SN), which is thought to guide task-specific suppression or engagement of the DMN by identifying the most relevant internal or extrapersonal stimuli.

There also were significant differences between the groups in age, expired CO on entry into the study, and FTND score. These group differences further suggest the robustness of the primary findings, as variation in these domains did not diminish the association between dACC Glu and DMN activity. It should be noted that while the groups did differ in age, both groups were comprised of relatively young adults (primary cohort range: 22\u201341 years, replication cohort: 18\u201333 years). Thus, we are unable to determine whether the reported association will be found other age groups such as adolescents or older adults. Additionally, despite group differences in FTND scores, both groups were identified as moderately nicotine dependent and we are unable to say whether individuals with mild or severe nicotine dependence would show the same relationship between dACC Glu and DMN activity. Additionally, we did not find any association between FTND and DMN smoking vs. neutral reactivity or dACC Glu/Cr in the primary (DMN: r = \u2212 0.21, p > 0.4, dACC Glu/Cr: 0.04, p > 0.87) or replication cohorts (DMN: r = 0.9, p > 0.01, dACC Glu/Cr: \u22120.23, p > 0.4). This lack of an association is consistent with the work of others where dACC Glu showed no relationship with smoking variables such as age of first cigarette, daily cigarette consumption, or lifetime cigarette exposure. Such findings suggest that while dACC Glu does not have an overt relationship with traditional smoking measures, dACC Glu is associated with brain function that may prime individuals to engage in self-referential processing under certain conditions such as during exposure to smoking cues.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25717, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several study limitations of this study that warrant discussion. First, MRS is unable to determine whether the measured Glu is related to neurotransmission, metabolism, or both. As such we cannot determine the specific mechanism through which heightened Glu may interact with DMN function and dACC connectivity. The approach that we took in the present study does not permit us to identify the causal link between these measures. However, the converging evidence across disciplines linking midline cortical Glu and DMN activity indicates an important relationship. Most telling is that varenicline-induced suppression of both dACC Glu and DMN reactivity, which supports the concept that these neurobiological factors are associated. Whether smoking cessation treatments disrupt the association between dACC Glu and DMN cue reactivity should be studied further. Additionally, future research is needed to clarify the exact mechanism for the relationship between dACC Glu and DMN cue reactivity. Such work would be supported by the investigation of the DMN during tasks unrelated to smoking involving healthy control participants to determine whether the relationship between dACC Glu/Cr extends to DMN engagement beyond smoking cue-reactivity. Healthy controls were not included in the current work as enhanced responding to smoking cues should only be noted in drug users, a concept supported by the fact that no reliable cuereactivity has been reported in non-smokers (Engleman et al., 2011). Despite these limitations, the current findings indicate that smokers with relatively greater levels of dACC Glu/Cr are more likely to engage the DMN when exposed to smoking cues suggesting that they are engaging in self-referential processing and may have difficulty disengaging from these internal smoking-related thoughts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27547, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
