Participants in both groups are administered baseline assessments to measure their alcohol consumption and severity of dependence and a variety of psychological and behavioural characteristics that are hypothesised to predict success with rtfMRI NFT. During the following 4 months, experimental participants are given six NFT sessions, and before and after each session various alcohol-related measures are taken. Participants in the control group are given the same measures to coincide with their timing in the experimental group. Eight and 12 months after the baseline assessment, both groups are followed up with a battery of measures. The primary research questions are whether NFT can be used to teach participants to down-regulate their brain activation in the presence of alcohol stimuli or to up-regulate their brain activation in response to pictures related to healthy goal pursuits, and, if so, whether this translates into reductions in alcohol consumption. The primary outcome measures will be those derived from the functional brain imaging data.

Thus, definitive conclusions about the efficacy of biofeedback could not be reached. Nevertheless, the interest in it prevailed into the 1980s and beyond, and at this time there was an increase in the number of ailments for which it was used. Additionally, EEG biofeedback was extended to cognitive enhancement and skill training for musicians and dancers and even surgeons, again with promising results.

For example, it localises brain signals to specific areas of the brain with more precise resolution, and it capitalises on the fact that relevant brain areas can be activated when patients only imagine particular events happening (e.g. moving a limb of the body, having a drink of alcohol). rtfMRI NFT has already been used in pilot studies to help patients with a variety of disorders to ameliorate their symptoms or unwanted behaviour. These include patients with debilitating pain, Parkinson\u2019s disease, depression, and nicotine addiction, or alcohol. The feedback that patients receive about their brain reactions and their ability to regulate them seems to have an added benefit in that it helps them to acquire a sense of control over their symptoms (e.g.).
