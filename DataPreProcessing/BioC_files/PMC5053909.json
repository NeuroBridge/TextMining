In addition to positive relationships between AMYG BOLD activity and dysphoric mood among women in our study, women with higher dysphoric mood at baseline showed decreased connectivity between HYPO and AMYG with OFC, and AMYG with HIPP. Anatomical and functional connectivity between the OFC (particularly the medial OFC, as found here) and subcortical limbic regions, such as the HYPO and AMYG, have been implicated in the processing of emotional stimuli and stress. The directionality of the current results (negative relationships between AMYG-OFC and AMYG-HIPP connectivity and dysphoric mood in women) is in agreement with recent evidence of stress-induced decreases in AMYG-OFC connectivity in healthy individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26868, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Nuclei in the HYPO and central medial AMYG are the most sexually dimorphic regions in the brain, and HIPP and OFC are also sexually dimorphic. In fact, we previously demonstrated HYPO and AMYG abnormalities in developmental prenatal stress models of adult depressive and anxiety-like behaviors in rats and mice, particularly in females, thus suggesting deficits in sexually dimorphic regions here have sex-dependent developmental roots. This is also suggested by our recent work in population-level studies of the same prenatal cohort as subjects in the study presented here, in which we demonstrated prenatal immune exposures predicting sex differences in the risk for depression and psychoses. Sex differences in AMYG connectivity have been also reported by others, for example, during rest, and substantial impact of circulating estradiol on functional connectivity between AMYG nuclei and regions of the default mode network during rest was suggested.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27824, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are a few potential limitations of this study. Our measure of dysphoric mood reflected clinical state rather than as a trait, thus hindering generalization to long-standing mood dysregulation. However, participants in our study with psychiatric illness were recurrent cases in remission and correlations between the POMS measures and Hamilton Depression Scale were high (see Supplementary Results), suggesting findings may also reflect trait characteristics. Future studies will benefit from including trait-related behavioral markers in relation to brain activity phenotyping. Another limitation of our study is the fact that we measured dysphoric mood only at baseline and thus our findings relate to baseline dysphoric mood and brain responses to negative affective stimuli. In future studies, it would be advantageous to assess changes in dysphoric mood induced by the negative affective stimuli.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28731, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The fact that we did not have the power to correct for the multiple comparisons related to the number of subsequently tested seeds or regions of interest is also a potential limitation. However, the initial whole brain analysis demonstrated significant (FWE-corrected) activity in the hypothesized negative affective circuitry regions. Thus, the regions of interest in the subsequent BOLD and connectivity analyses were derived independently through a robust (n=99), FWE-corrected analysis, which reduced the odds of potential type 1 errors and supported the relevance of the results. In addition, given that we chose a hypothesis-driven approach and limited the number of tested seeds and regions of interest to the hypothesized a priori selected ones, we cannot generalize to non-hypothesized regions in the brain. However, in independent samples over the last 10 years, we have consistently activated these regions using this fMRI paradigm and demonstrated significant sex differences in brain activity.

However, post-hoc examination of the data revealed a higher rate of substance use among men than women, and subjects with substance use histories demonstrated greater severity of dysphoric mood state. This is consistent with other studies reporting high rates of mood dysregulation among individuals with substance use, and some studies demonstrating a sex difference in the link between depressed mood and self-medication.

It is important for future work to delineate the underlying physiological mechanisms and origins of these deficits in order to more fully identify the biosignature associated with arousal and negative affect. A recent fMRI study combined brain activity measures with clinical measures with success at better predicting variance in treatment response. The ultimate goal of identifying the neural, physiologic and genetic signatures of shared traits is to discover new targets for drug discovery to enhance treatment efficacy. We demonstrated here that this entails a sex-dependent lens on therapeutic development, particularly when considering mood states across the spectrum of healthy individuals and those with psychiatric
