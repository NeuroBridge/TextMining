Additional exclusion criteria for healthy controls included a history of any mental disorder and a first-degree relative with any mental disorder. The severity of psychiatric symptoms in the patients with schizophrenia was quantitatively assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).
