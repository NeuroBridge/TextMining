We filled this gap by learning cross-individual co-variance among structural and functional measures using large-scale neuroimaging datasets. A discover-confirm scheme was applied to two independent samples (N\u00a0=\u00a0184 and N\u00a0=\u00a0340) of multi-modal neuroimaging datasets.

Fifteen multi-metric co-variance units, representing different co-variance relationships among the 12 metrics, were reliable across the two sets of neuroimaging datasets. The reliable co-variance units were summarized into a database, where users can select any location on the cortical map of any metric to examine the co-varying maps with the other 11 metrics. This database characterized the six functional metrics based on their co-variance with structural metrics, and provided a detailed reference to connect previous findings using different metrics and to predict maps of unexamined metrics.

For example, the vol, area, and thick metrics are popular measures used to quantify brain morphometric abnormalities in schizophrenia (e.g., Ohtani et al.; Sprooten et al.; Xiang et al.). In particular, these metrics play different roles in distinguishing schizophrenia from bipolar disorder patients (Rimol et al.). The curv, lgi, and sulc metrics have been developed to characterize gyri-folding patterns (Schaer et al.), reflecting complex interactions between differential growth rates, various physical processes, and the specific layout of cortical fiber connections (White and Hilgetag).

In addition to traditional seed-based temporal correlations, metrics, including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (alff), degree centrality (dc), eigenvector centrality (ec), regional homogeneity (reho), and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (falff), have been frequently used in functional imaging studies. Indeed, alff and falff metrics have been employed to quantify abnormalities in voxel-wise low-frequency fluctuations in schizophrenia patients (Yang et al.; Zou et al.; Zuo et al.), and these metrics reflect distinguishable locations of abnormality in the cortex (Hoptman et al.). The reho metric (Zang et al.) reflects the local synchronization of low-frequency fluctuations as a local connectivity measure (for a comprehensive review, see Jiang and Zuo). The use of the surface-based reho metric to exclude the influence of non-gray matter signals (i.e., partial volume effects) has recently been proposed (Zuo et al.) in association with the hierarchical architecture of functional organization in the human brain (Jiang et al.). The dc and ec metrics characterize the intrinsic functional organizations of the brain in a graph-theoretical perspective (Buckner et al.; Bullmore and Sporns; Lohmann et al.; Zuo et al.; Zuo and Xing), which has been adopted in neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia to investigate deficits in brain network hubs (Alexander-Bloch; Lord et al.; for a review see Rubinov and Bullmore).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5050, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While a number of studies have demonstrated superior performance of combining information from multiple metrics (or imaging modalities) to examine neural mechanisms underlying behaviors and distinguish mental disorders (Fan et al.; Kim et al.; Palaniyappan and Liddle; Wee et al.; Zhang et al.), the relationships between these structural and functional metrics are largely unknown. Specifically, our understanding of the associations across multiple neuroimaging metrics is restricted in three aspects: first, nearly all multi-modal studies integrate no more than three metrics; second, many studies combine information from multiple metrics based on their spatial overlaps, but relevant metrics do not necessarily overlap in space; and third, most studies compare specific groups of patients to healthy controls.

The gRAICAR algorithm is effective in revealing intrinsic inter-subject relationships (Kyathanahally et al.; Yang et al.) or patient subtypes (Yang et al.). Supplementary Fig.\u00a01 presents a demonstration of the gRAICAR algorithm. Specifically, gRAICAR first constructed a full similarity matrix (FSM) containing pair-wise similarity between all the SCMs from the 12 metrics (Fig. S1A). The similarity between the SCMs was defined as the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between their subject courses. The value of this similarity reflects the coherence between two SCMs in terms of their cross-subject variations. gRAICAR then searched through the FSM for clusters of SCMs (demonstrated in Fig. S1). The first operation in the search procedure was ranking the SCMs according to their \u201cpopularity\u201d among SCMs from different metrics. The following steps were conducted to compute the \u201cpopularity\u201d of SCMs: (1) the FSM was segmented into metric-blocks, so that the FSMs from the same metric stayed together and the similarity values between them were represented in a block within the FSM (Fig. S1A). (2) The similarity values were converted into relative values (Zrow) within each row in each metric-block (Fig. S1B). (3) The maximal value in each row of each metric-block in Zrow was then retained in a new matrix (Zmax), and all other values were set to 0 (Fig. S1C). Each row in the Zmax matrix thus revealed the most similar SCMs from different metrics to the SCM represented in current row. (4) The Zmax matrix was multiplied to its transform (multiply elements in corresponding locations, Fig. S1D). This operation eliminated unpaired inter-metric maximal similarities. (5) In the resultant matrix, the sum of each row yielded the \u201cpopularity\u201d value for each SCM, representing a special form of centrality that takes specificity and mutual correspondence of SCMs into account. We then computed a standardized FSM by adding the Zrow matrix to its transpose, so that the similarity between a pair of SCMs from different metrics was standardized among all SCMs from the relevant metrics (Fig. S1E).

First, the full picture of the relationships between six functional and six structural metrics brings in a novel avenue to characterize the functional metrics. A fundamental question for the neuroimaging field is what the functional metrics really tell us or what is their generative mechanism from the brain structure (Betzel et al.). Many researchers have attempted to associate functional metrics to various phenotypes (Medaglia et al.), but have not achieved a fully clear understanding of the biological meaning of these functional metrics. Our study offers a novel perspective that characterizes functional metrics based on their shared information with the structural metrics across individuals. Specifically, our results as in Fig.\u00a02 suggest that alff weakly reflect variability in vol and area, dc has specific associations with vol, and ec has strong and specific associations with vol and area. The falff seems to carry unique information because it does not associate with any structural metrics. Surface-based reho reflects a combination of multiple structural metrics including area, sulc, curv, and thick. Reho2 is different from reho in that it has much weaker associations to structural metrics, echoing the nature of this local connectivity measure as a multi-modal, multi-scale neuroimaging marker of the human connectome (Jiang and Zuo). Interestingly, since the reho metric reflects local coherence of the intrinsic neural activities (Zang et al.), an insight from our finding is that only the coherence of activity within a close neighborhood (reho) reflects a synthesized variation of structural metrics, but not the coherence in a larger neighborhood (reho2). Another implication from Fig.\u00a02 is that ec is the most structure-related functional metric, while falff is the most structure-irrelevant functional metric. Our systematic, unbiased investigation on large samples makes it possible to uncover these novel insights about the functional metrics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41455, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, the present study extends the scope of structural\u2013functional association investigations. Most studies linked structural and functional metrics based on their spatial correspondence (Liao et al.; Seeley et al.; Segall; Zhang et al.; Vidal-Pineiro et al.). The MMCUs found in our study suggest that the most reliably associated metric maps do not necessarily overlap in space. For instance, Fig.\u00a03 indicates that multiple structural metrics (lgi, area, and vol) around the right SFG co-vary with the functional metrics (ec and alff). However, the SCMs of ec and alff showed different spatial distributions: while the ec SCM was consistent with the structural metrics, the alff SCM showed widespread contributions across the brain. This argument is supported by studies on mental disorders. For instance, gray matter abnormality in parietal and frontal regions in schizophrenia patients has been associated to the abnormal functional activations in bilateral temporal regions under an oddball task (Calhoun et al.); abnormal correlation between the mean cortical thickness and the mean fractional anisotropy of the white matter has also been reported in schizophrenia patients (Sasamoto et al.).

Given the general principle that combining more unique information helps to improve the predictive power, our result that the functional metrics carry different information from the structural metrics suggests that combining more functional metrics may improve the performance of a machine-learning application. On the other hand, including more features in machine-learning models can lead to very high dimensionality and over-fitting issues. The reliable MMCUs in our study provide highly detailed reference for selecting effective features, and thus help to avoid the over-fitting problem. As an example, Fig.\u00a04 indicates that the vol and area metrics in the middle frontal gyrus strongly co-vary with the lgi of the right posterior insula and the sulc of the inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting these four features are mutually dependent and three of them could be excluded in a machine-learning study.

Knowledge that bridges genetic factors, neural activities, and neuroimaging properties (Richiardi et al.) might help investigations of the detailed mechanisms for these observations, serving as important topics for future studies (e.g., genetic basis and computational model of these MMCUs).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49518, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Methodological issues", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49540, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As argued by several studies, preprocessing pipelines (e.g., how to correct for motion artifacts) influence the results of functional MRI studies (Strother et al.; Power et al.; Aurich et al.; Glatard et al.). Consequently, differences in preprocessing pipelines should be taken into account when comparing other findings to our results (i.e., using our results as a reference for common structural\u2013functional associations). To alleviate this issue, we chose a preprocessing strategy that was shown to generate graph-theoretical metrics with the maximal inter-subject reliability and minimal dependency on subject head motion among several commonly used preprocessing pipelines (Aurich et al.). We argue that while different preprocessing pipelines have different considerations and advantages, they share an identical ultimate goal to produce results that are robust against confounding factors such as head motion, and that our choice of preprocessing pipeline is a maximal effort to reduce the influence of processing pipelines. As an additional effort to produce reproducible and useful results (Pernet and Poline), we shared all datasets (FCP-Cambridge and CoRR-SWU), preprocessing pipelines such as CCS, gRAICAR,3 and other scripts4 to the public for researchers to tune the processing parameters at will in examining pipeline-specific/independent structural\u2013functional associations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50930, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another important issue is that the dimensionality estimations in the ICA decomposition may impact the resultant MMCUs.
