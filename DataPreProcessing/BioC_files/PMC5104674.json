This framework also enables whole brain voxel-wise searching by combining multivariate techniques such as ReliefF, clustering, correlation-based feature selection and multiple regression models, which is more flexible and can achieve better prediction performance than alternative atlas-based methods. For 50 healthy controls and 47 schizophrenia patients, three kinds of features derived from resting-state fMRI (fALFF), sMRI (gray matter) and DTI (fractional anisotropy) were extracted and fed into a regression model, achieving high prediction for both cognitive scores (MCCB composite r = 0.7033, MCCB social cognition r = 0.7084) and symptomatic scores (positive and negative syndrome scale [PANSS] positive r = 0.7785, PANSS negative r = 0.7804). Moreover, the brain areas likely responsible for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia, including middle temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, striatum, cuneus and cerebellum, were located with different weights, as well as regions predicting PANSS symptoms, including thalamus, striatum and inferior parietal lobule, pinpointing the potential neuromarkers. Finally, compared to a single modality, multimodal combination achieves higher prediction accuracy and enables individualized prediction on multiple clinical measures.

Neuroimaging has greatly enhanced our understanding of the human brain and its variation across individuals (neurodiversity) in health and disease. However, most criteria that used to assess severity/prognosis of brain disorders are still primarily based on clinical judgment; thus, the subjective factors of the doctors cannot be avoided. In addition, the overlapped cognitive or behavior performance of several mental disorders emphasizes the inadequacy of a diagnosis based purely on symptoms or behaviors alone and highlights the need for objective imaging neuromarkers that can assist the timely diagnosis or treatment. Therefore, using brain-imaging data to identify the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive impairment or symptom changes in brain diseases is an important research topic, since it is helpful for better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the illness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3144, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Predictive data mining has become popular in neuroimaging studies in a recent decade, especially for mental disorders research. Recent studies have started to use machine-learning techniques to detect neuroimaging patterns that may predict cognitive or behavioral performance. And initial brain measures have indicated compelling potential to predict health-related outcomes. However, most predictive studies to date have only related variation in baseline brain measures to variation in subsequent outcomes, which could be described more as post-diction or correlation rather than prediction. There are, however, a few examples of studies that are indeed \u201cpredicting\u201d specific values of the target measures. For example, Wan et al. has proposed an elegant regression model called CORNLIN that employs a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to predict multiple cognitive scores based on 98 structural MRI regions of interests (ROIs) for Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients. The polynomial model used in CORNLIN can detect either a nonlinear or linear relationship between brain structure and cognitive decline. Stonnington et al. adopted relevance vector regression, a sparse kernel method formulated in a Bayesian framework, to predict four sets of cognitive scores using MRI voxel based morphometry measures. Wang et al. and Zhang et al. employed multi-task learning strategies for selecting biomarkers that could predict multiple clinical scores, e.g., using \u21132\u2013norm coupled with \u21131-norm in regression models or multi-task feature selection coupled with a support vector machine (SVM).

In addition, quite often the input feature dimensionality is restricted, e.g. based on ROI features derived from AAL (Anatomical Automatic Labeling) templates, but without performing whole brain voxel-wise searching because of the computational load. Hence, we are motivated to propose a generalized model that is able to predict explicit values of the targeted measures by whole brain voxel-wise searching via cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and by combining joint information from multiple imaging modalities. Based on this motivation, we could use purely data-driven techniques to estimate the cognitive scores symptom changes or to classify disease subcategories using MRI measures, providing a potentially biologically valid framework for understanding mental illnesses or for even predicting the progression of the disease.

Then data-driven spatial clustering was performed to obtain fewer ROI-based features by averaging of the clusters, of which one cluster may consist several parts of the brain regions parcellated by atlas-based template, such AAL template. Note that using brain regions segmented by atlas as features is an alternative in our prediction, whereas, our proposed method is a purely data-driven feature extraction via whole brain voxel-wise searching, and achieves a higher prediction accuracy compared to AAL atlas-based methods, see results and the supplementary file (Supplementary Table S4). After this, the ROI-based features of different modalities were combined to take advantage of the multimodal complementary information, and further refined by correlation-based feature selection (CFS), producing a feature subset before regression. This step is necessary; since spatial clustering and averaging generate ROIs that compared to voxel-wise features indicate decreased relevance to target measure and may contain redundant information. Finally, by cutting-edge multiple regression models, a combination of joint brain feature subsets is formed to best predict the targeted measures.
