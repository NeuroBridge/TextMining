Functions investigated should include emotional processing and regulation, in addition to executive functions, as these functions may be differently associated with substance use development in females and males. Similar regions of reduced gray matter have been found to be a characteristic that crosses diagnostic boundaries. More work is needed investigating sexual dimorphism in mechanisms driving drug-seeking behavior and transitions to substance use problems in females and males with BD, including environmental/societal influences, and commonalities and distinctions between BD and other psychiatric disorders. The current study did not include an at risk comparison group so diagnostic-associated neuroanatomical factors associated with risk cannot be determined. Future studies focused on mechanisms underlying variation in GMV, and associated outcomes, in BD are needed. The glutamatergic system is involved in adolescent brain maturation and abnormalities within this system are implicated in addiction and pediatric BD. Other factors that could contribute to altered GMV in BD include, but are not limited to, abnormalities in the serotonergic system and/or sex hormones. For example, rodent studies suggest estrogen in females can reduce neuron density in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Studies examining resilience to developing substance use in psychiatric disorders and at risk populations could reveal novel therapeutic strategies.

This comorbidity often develops in adolescence and is associated with adverse outcomes. We prospectively investigated the relationship of gray matter volume (GMV) to subsequent substance use problems in adolescents with BD. Results indicate substance use problems in BD are associated with lower dorsolateral prefrontal GMV in females and males, lower orbitofrontal and insula GMV in females, and lower rostral prefrontal GMV in males. These common and sex-related findings point to regulatory brain systems that may underlie comorbid substance abuse and serve as targets for early detection and intervention strategies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
