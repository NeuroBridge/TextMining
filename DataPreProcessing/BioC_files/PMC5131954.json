It is triggered by the possibility of obtaining rewards to initiate the neurobehavioral adaptations necessary to achieve them by directing the information from motivational circuits to cognitive and action circuits. In drug addiction, the altered dopamine (DA) modulation of the meso-cortico-limbic reward circuitry, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), underlies the disproportionate motivational value of drug use at the expense of other non-drug reinforcers and the user\u2019s loss of control over his/her drug intake. We examine how the magnitude of the reward affects goal-directed processes in healthy control (HC) subjects and abstinent cocaine dependent (ACD) patients by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a counting Stroop task with blocked levels of monetary incentives of different magnitudes (\u20ac0, \u20ac0.01, \u20ac0.5, \u20ac1 or \u20ac1.5). Our results showed that increasing reward magnitude enhances (1) performance facilitation in both groups; (2) left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity in HC and left superior occipital cortex activity in ACD; and (3) left DLPFC and left putamen connectivity in ACD compared to HC. Moreover, we observed that (4) dorsal striatal and pallidum activity was associated with craving and addiction severity during the parametric increases in the monetary reward.

In addition to behavioral and/or pharmacological treatment, patients were monitored for continued abstinence with urine toxicology testing or through clinical interviews with a psychiatrist who supervised treatment. All 34 patients received the primary Axis I diagnosis of cocaine dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Due to the high rates of comorbidity with alcohol and other drug abuse in the patient population, patients were not excluded if they had abused other drugs or alcohol prior to the onset of their cocaine abstinence. On the other hand, the HC group was recruited by placing posters in public places such as town halls and universities, and through word of mouth. A previous interview collected past and current drug use data and ensured that HC had no history of psychoactive substance dependence or abuse. Exclusion criteria for HC and ACD were as follows: 1) Any major psychiatric illness; 2) Head trauma resulting in loss of consciousness for longer than 30 min; 3) Presence of any past or current brain pathology; 4) The presence of any contraindications to an MRI environment. Before the scanning session, the ACD filled in two addiction severity-related scales: the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA,) and the Spanish version of the Severity Dependence Scale (SDS,). Furthermore, patients were screened on their craving-related score, based on the 12-item Spanish version of the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire-General (SCCQ-G-12,) (see Table 1).

By contrast, to test the brain areas where ACD showed a higher parametric modulation than HC, we fitted the contrast [2 1\u20131\u20132\u20132\u20131 1 2].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18680, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Psychophysiological interactions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18713, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The PPI analysis determines the regions whose time series of activation exhibit significant covariance with the seed. PPI is a context-dependent connectivity measure used to explain the regional activity of other brain regions in terms of the interaction between responses in a seed region and a cognitive process. We carried out a PPI analysis using the generalized PPI toolbox (gPPI; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi;). For each participant and task condition (psychological variables) in the gPPI, we calculated an interaction term using the de-convolved activity of the seed region and the separate regressors that represented the task conditions. Then we re-convolved the calculated interaction terms with the hemodynamic response function and included them in a GLM model, along with the time course of the seed region, the regressors modeling the task conditions, and the motion parameters. In the present study, we planned to perform a gPPI for each brain area in the PFC that showed significant differences between groups in parametric modulation as a function of the reward magnitude (see the Results section). After generating the model, we performed contrast images using the beta-weights for the interaction terms. Specifically, we generated statistical contrast images by subtracting the \u20ac0 condition from the rest of the reward magnitudes (once again, R1, R2, R3, R4) to test which regions changed their task-related connectivity with the seed as a function of the monetary reward. We performed a 4x2 mixed-design ANOVA, including the within-subject factor Reward (R1, R2, R3, R4) and the between-subject factor Group (HC, ACD) in order to compare HC and ACD on the way parametric increases in monetary reward magnitude modulate the connectivity between the prefrontal and striatal regions, and we fitted the same contrast as in the fMRI analysis to test between-group differences.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20612, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Regression analysis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20632, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Regression analyses were utilized to investigate the relationship between individual scores on the CSSA, SDS and SCCQ-N-10 questionnaires and brain activation during reward magnitude increases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20826, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Region-of-interest analysis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20854, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We focused our analyses on regions of interest (ROIs) for two reasons: to analyze the brain regions previously associated with interference task performance in cocaine addiction, and to maximize statistical power.

Then, we ran a gPPI analysis using the same ROI that we used for the previous functional analyses in this area. As Table 3 shows, we observed greater connectivity between the left DLPFC and the left putamen in ACD than in HC when we analyzed the parametric effect (R1<R2<R3<R4) (FWE at p<0.05). For illustration purposes, we plotted the parametric effect (R1<R2<R3<R4) by extracting the eigenvalues for each separate monetary condition (R1, R2, R3, R4) and for each group, from the suprathreshold voxels in the putamen (see Fig 5). The beta-weights were analyzed using the SPSS software package, v.20, by performing the following analyses: (1) a 4x2 mixed-design ANOVA including the within-subject factor Reward (R1, R2, R3, R4) for each group; (2) within-group pairwise comparisons between reward conditions; and (3) pairwise comparisons between experimental groups for each reward condition. Again, these post-hoc analyses were run to examine what drove the parametric effects, obtaining a more thorough picture of what is driving the effect, but they should not be considered for statistical inference.

At the brain level, increasing the reward magnitude increased left DLPFC activation in HC compared to ACD, whereas it increased left superior occipital cortex activation in ACD compared to HC. In addition, increasing the reward magnitude strengthened the connectivity between the left DLPFC and the left putamen more in ACD than in HC. Finally, high individual craving scores were negatively associated with the left caudate, and dependence severity scores were positively related to the right pallidum during parametric reward increases. Therefore, the present study shows differences between HC and ACD in the regional brain activation and connectivity involving the frontostriatal circuitry and other areas, as a function of increasing the monetary reward magnitudes and clinical variables, with no behavioral differences between the groups\u2019 performance, but within-group enhanced behavioral performance under reward conditions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36822, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Impact of reward on performance and its relation with self-reported interest on reward value", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36915, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The behavioral results confirm the enhanced task performance in both groups under monetary reward contingencies in the absence of significant differences between HC and ACD in performance improvement; that is, both groups decreased their RTs and error rate as the monetary reward increased. Reward-associated enhanced performance in our study agrees with previous reports that evaluated the effects of a monetary reward in cocaine addicts and healthy controls during cognitive control tasks such as drug Stroop, spatial learning, and decision making. Therefore, although drug addiction is characterized by an enhanced motivational value of the drug at the expense of other reinforcers and impaired cognitive control, our results and previous ones suggest that cocaine addicts\u2019 goal-directed behavior benefits from an immediate monetary reward contingency. Regarding the relationship between self-reported interest and behavioral improvement, similarly to Goldstein et al., we did not observe a group effect or an interaction effect on self-reported interest. However, we obtained between-group differences when comparing the correlation coefficients, with a trend toward showing the opposite pattern of correlations for HC and ACD between self-reported interest and RT and SDrt. These results might be interpreted as additional evidence for reward threshold elevations or reward sensitivity decreases in cocaine addicts. Otherwise, these results can be explained in the context of secondary reinforcing effects of money in rewarding drug procurement, associated with money availability. We speculate about whether the fact that increases in the monetary reward magnitude improved goal-directed behavior in ACD would suggest the need to change strategies in abstinence therapies by weighting up reward rather than using other reinforcing contingencies (e.g., motivate drug users to attend treatment sessions regularly). In this regard, the fact that money availability can condition drug procurement might mean that clinical interventions should focus on promoting the more immediate and reinforcing goal of social, family, and health rewards because monetary reward cues could increase craving or drug urges, contributing to maintained drug use.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39161, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Impact of monetary reward gradients on brain activity", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39215, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Functional results confirm our second hypothesis because the activity of the prefrontal regions was negatively modulated by the increasing monetary reward magnitude in ACD compared to HC, but ACD increase the activation of other brain regions, such as the superior occipital cortex, which might counteract prefrontal differences with HC. The brain activation in the absence of performance differences between these same groups may be interpreted in several ways (see for a discussion on similar effects), but the most frequent interpretation in drug addiction research would be to consider differences in patients\u2019 brain activation as a vulnerability index for the cognitive dysfunction underlying the neuronal changes associated with lengthy drug use. The DLPFC plays an important role in integrating cognitive and motivational information processing, and previous studies using cognitive tasks have shown its involvement in reward modulation. The interaction effect obtained in the DLPFC shows a difference between the groups\u2019 BOLD signal in relation to their sensitivity to reward gradients. Thus, the reduced activation in the DLPFC during goal-directed behavior associated with achieving higher monetary rewards in ACD agrees with addiction features that compromise cognitive control and reduce reward sensitivity associated with drug-related changes and frontal lobe functioning and top-down processes; although we observed increased activation in occipital regions in the ACD group. We suggest that reward may modulate different neural pathways from those shown to be modulated by monetary gradients in ACD compared to HC. We observed an interaction effect in the superior occipital cortex which could be interpreted as an attentional reactivity to reward that allowed functional compensation. In fact, previous studies evaluating the involvement of cocaine addiction in cognitive control functions such as attention and working memory found that, compared to HC, ACD showed hyperactivity in brain areas such as the parietal and occipital cortex. This result was interpreted as a greater recruitment of the visual attention network to support sustained visual processing, in order to compensate for the deficit in executive functions. In addition, previous studies using control attention tasks with monetary contingencies have related the enhancement of the bilateral occipital cortex to visual spatial attention, suggesting that the superior occipital cortex is an important area involved in attentional orientation, depending on the motivational meaning of the stimulus.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41796, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Brain connectivity between left DLPFC and left putamen", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41851, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We confirmed our third hypothesis.

DLPFC-striatum connectivity has been described in classic accounts of motivation system anatomy as an associative network involved in goal-directed instrumental behavior sensitive to changes in the outcome of the action; that is, DLPFC motivational and cognitive information integration appears to rely on interactions with the striatum. Although no previous studies have investigated the connectivity in the frontrostriatal network related to reward contingencies in cocaine addicts, Konova et al. and Tau et al. related the response to money in the striatum to impaired involvement of brain regions during task performance. Specifically, Konova et al. associated putamen hyperactivity during a parametric increase in the monetary reward on a drug Stroop task with a general ventromedial prefrontal deactivation across reward conditions, which was interpreted as a compensatory mechanism necessary to maintain similar levels of performance.

Regarding the former, previous studies exploring cocaine craving observed that caudate activation increased during higher self-reported craving. However, we should take into account that the methodology employed in these studies was quite different from ours because these paradigms induced craving by showing a cocaine video, and then they evaluated the relationship between self-reported craving at that moment and brain activity. By contrast, we used an interference Stroop condition in which participants were requested to involve cognitive-control processes to obtain money, whereas craving reported by the cocaine addicts refers to what they felt during the past two weeks. We suggest that left caudate hypoactivation could be related to poor cognitive control associated with craving according to previous studies.
