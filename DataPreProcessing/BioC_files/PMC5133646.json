Based on evidence that the posterior hippocampus mediates memory for fine-grained spatial information, and prior evidence that patients show unimpaired eye-movement memory effects for item but not for spatial changes, we predicted that patients would be specifically impaired in their ability to recruit the posterior hippocampus to detect spatial changes, but that there would be no group difference during detection of item changes. fMRI results supported the prediction of reduced posterior hippocampal activation in patients with schizophrenia during recognition of spatial changes, but, unexpectedly, also showed a group difference in the anterior hippocampus, in which patients demonstrated greater activation than healthy controls during correct recognition of item changes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21174, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As noted in the introduction, the dorsal hippocampus in rats, which is homologous to the posterior hippocampus in humans, is known to support fine-grained representation of spatial configurations, and dorsal hippocampal lesions impair spatial memory. The present paradigm was designed to place heavy demands on these processes by assessing memory for subtle changes in the positions of objects in a complex scene. Consistent with this, fMRI results showed that healthy controls relied disproportionately on the posterior hippocampus to detect item and spatial changes. The notion that the posterior hippocampus may be particularly vulnerable to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia was first suggested by post-mortem studies. More recently, a resting state fMRI study used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to demonstrate that connectivity from the hippocampus to inferior frontal gyrus was reduced in patients with schizophrenia and in individuals at high risk for psychosis in the posterior but not in the anterior hippocampus. Moreover, a structural MRI study demonstrated regionally specific volumetric reductions in the tail of the hippocampus that were more prominent in patients with schizophrenia than in patients with major depressive disorder. The present study provides further support to the notion of a dysfunctional posterior hippocampus in people with schizophrenia and suggests that future fMRI studies may wish to separately examine anterior and posterior portions of the hippocampus rather than treating it as a unitary structure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22719, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An unexpected finding was that, during detection of item changes, activity in the anterior hippocampus was abnormally increased in patients with schizophrenia relative to healthy controls. Although this finding was not predicted, it fits well with theories proposing that portions of the anterior hippocampus are \u201chyperactive\u201d in schizophrenia. According to this view, either abnormal modulation of phasic dopamine activity, or disrupted glutamatergic or GABAergic signaling may lead to hyperexcitability in the anterior hippocampus. A possible explanation for patient hyperactivity in the current study is that patients may have disproportionately relied on the anterior hippocampus to successfully detect item changes.

The anterior temporal network has preferential connectivity with the anterior hippocampus, and includes the lateral entorhinal, perirhinal, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex. This anterior temporal network has been implicated in familiarity-based item recognition and semantic processes that are less severely impaired in patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, the posterior medial network includes the parahippocampal, retrosplenial, medial prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortex, and shows preferential connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. Activation in this posterior medial network is enhanced during recollection-based recognition and spatial memory retrieval - processes that are known to be impaired in patients with schizophrenia. This explanation is admittedly speculative, and whole-brain results did not reveal a pattern of regional impairments during spatial memory that could clearly be assigned to either network. A possible way forward may be to examine resting-state functional connectivity in these anterior temporal and posterior medial networks in relation to validated measures of specific encoding and retrieval processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24994, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "People with schizophrenia also had memory impairments across item change and spatial change conditions.

Participants learned each item in relation to the item's location in a complex visual scene, which provided a very strong learning context. It is well established that when items are initially associated with a strong context, recognition of the items is context dependent (see, for example,).

Examination of these memory processes with the current task paradigm in individuals who are at clinical or genetic high risk for psychosis, but are not medicated, is another approach that may help to identify any role that medication plays in this differential pattern of anterior and posterior hippocampal functioning in patients with schizophrenia. Nevertheless, the observed group by condition interactions for both the anterior and posterior hippocampus are difficult to attribute to a medication confound, which might be expected to have a less regionally and functionally specific impact on hippocampal processing.
