Here we used functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping to study alcohol-related changes in resting brain activity and their association with behavior. Heavy drinkers (HD; N=16; 16 males) and normal controls (NM; N=24; 14 males) were tested after placebo and after acute alcohol administration. Group comparisons showed that NM had higher FCD in visual and prefrontal cortices, default-mode network regions, and thalamus, while HD had higher FCD in cerebellum. Acute alcohol significantly increased FCD within the thalamus, impaired cognitive and motor functions, and affected self-reports of mood/drug effects in both groups. Partial least squares regression showed alcohol-induced changes in mood/drug effects were associated with changes in thalamic FCD in both groups. Disruptions in motor function were associated with increases in cerebellar FCD in NM and thalamus FCD in HD. Alcohol-induced declines in cognitive performance were associated with connectivity increases in visual cortex and thalamus in NM, but in HD, increases in precuneus FCD were associated with improved cognitive performance. Acute alcohol reduced \u201cneurocognitive coupling\u201d, the association between behavioral performance and FCD (indexing brain activity), an effect that was accentuated in HD compared to NM. Findings suggest that reduced cortical connectivity in HD contribute to decline in cognitive abilities associated with heavy alcohol consumption, whereas increased cerebellar connectivity in HD may have compensatory effects on behavioral performance.

While it is debatable whether moderate drinking offers any health benefits, the deleterious effects of excessive alcohol use on the brain and behavior are well recognized. There has been a challenge to characterize the effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure on the association between resting brain activity and behavior. Studies measuring resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) during alcohol intoxication have shown CBF increases particularly within the frontal and temporal cortices, which in part reflect ethanol-induced vasodilatation. In contrast, studies measuring cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) during alcohol intoxication have shown reductions in glucose metabolism throughout the brain that were most pronounced in the visual cortex and cerebellum. The opposite effects of acute alcohol on CBF and CMRglc, on one hand reflect alcohol\u2019s vasoactive effects, and on the other hand reflect the use of alternative energy sources for brain metabolism (e.g., alcohol\u2019s metabolite acetate). Specifically, recent work has suggested that biphasic vasoactive properties of alcohol may disrupt the coupling between neuronal activity and CBF. In relation to the association between CMRglc and brain activity during intoxication, our work has suggested that alcohol-induced decreases in glucose metabolism are concurrent with brain-wide increases in acetate metabolism. The acetate content in plasma increases during alcohol intoxication. Thus, we have interpreted alcohol-induced decreases in glucose metabolism to reflect the preference of glial cells for acetate as an energy source. This effect appears to be accentuated in heavy alcohol drinkers and in alcoholics. CBF and CMRglc measures seem to reveal a more consistent pattern for the effect of chronic drinking on the resting brain. Relative to light drinkers, heavy drinkers show lower resting CBF, particularly within the frontal lobe, and lower resting CMRglc, possibly due to higher acetate metabolism. In summary, it is difficult to determine the extent to which effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure on CBF and CMRglc reflect exclusive changes in neuronal activity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4188, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Alternative measures of resting brain activity include fMRI resting-state functional connectivity, which estimates synchronous changes in blood oxygenation level between and within brain regions at rest. Inter- and intra-regional resting-state fMRI connectivity reflect synchronous oscillations in neuronal activity that are largely insensitive to vasodilation, and are also unlikely to be affected by brain-wide changes in metabolic supply. Moreover, prior research has shown that measures of resting state functional connectivity are sensitive to effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure on the brain. Specifically, alcohol intoxication has been associated with increases in connectivity between the brainstem and somatosensory network, and within the visual network, as well as time-varying changes in connectivity within the default mode network (DMN). As for chronic exposures, the frequency of alcohol use has been associated with connectivity in the dorsal DMN, and alcoholics show weaker within- (including the DMN) and between-network connectivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5251, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Up to now, fMRI resting-state research in alcohol and alcoholism has been mostly limited to pre-defined resting state networks or seed-voxel correlations. Recently, functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping has been proposed as a voxel-wise measure of resting state functional connectivity. Specifically, this approach provides measures of local functional connectivity density (lFCD; size of the local cluster of correlated voxels) and global functional connectivity density (gFCD; the total number of correlated voxels) for each voxel. Studies in healthy controls have suggested that lFCD and gFCD account for up to 70% of glucose demand in the resting brain indicating that they serve as an index of brain activity at rest. To mitigate confounds from CBF and CMRglc measures, our goal here was to use lFCD and gFCD as alternative measures to assess the effects of acute and chronic alcohol consumption on activity of the brain at rest.

Since alcohol intoxication is associated with multiple behavioral domains, here we investigated the association between brain regions showing significant alcohol-related changes in FCD and behavioral measures in three categories: mood/drug effects, motor, and cognitive functions. Specifically, we predicted that alcohol-induced changes in mood/drug effects would be concurrent with connectivity changes in thalamus and limbic brain regions showing FCD effects . We predicted that alcohol-related motor effects (e.g., balance and coordination) would be concurrent with connectivity changes in cerebellar regions showing alcohol-related FCD effects. For cognitive effects of alcohol, a recent meta-analysis reported that multiple cognitive domains are affected in alcoholics including, executive functions which rely on prefrontal cortex (PFC), and visuospatial abilities which rely on occipital and parietal regions. Hence, we hypothesized that alcohol effects on cognitive performance would be associated with FCD effects in PFC and occipital and parietal regions. It has been increasingly recognized that the cerebellum also contributes to cognitive functions and that cerebellar damage contributes to cognitive deficits in alcoholics. Accordingly, we hypothesized an association between FCD effects in cerebellum and alcohol effects on cognitive performance. Finally, we assessed the effects of alcohol administration on the overall neurocognitive coupling: the association between behavioral performance and FCD in regions with significant voxel-wise alcohol-related effects.

The sensitivity of the thalamus to acute alcohol is also consistent with prior findings showing high uptake of alcohol in the thalamus of non-human primates. The thalamic nuclei that were affected by alcohol namely the VLN and MDN are nuclei that receive direct projection from DA neurons in VTA and hence their activation might reflect alcohol induced dopaminergic signaling. In fact we had previously shown that DA increases triggered by methylphenidate (MP) were associated with metabolic changes in the thalamus, which were significantly increased in controls but not in alcoholics. Our findings also showed that acute alcohol significantly increased global connectivity in the midbrain as a part of a gFCD cluster centered at the thalamus (Table 2), which is where DA neurons are located. This effect is consistent with the influence of alcohol on DA signaling.

Acute and chronic alcohol consumption affect a wide range of mood, motor, and cognitive measures. Alcohol affects neuronal activity, but also indirect measures of neuronal activity. Increases in CBF through vasodilation and deceases in glucose metabolism through metabolizing acetate are of examples of effects of alcohol on indirect measures of brain activity. Because of the high sensitivity of CBF and CMRglc to non-neuronal alcohol-induced effects, here we used an alternative index of resting brain activity, i.e., resting functional connectivity density (FCD), to index slow-rate synchronous neuronal rhythms within (lFCD) and between (gFCD) brain regions. Prior research has shown that that FCD accounts for a large proportion of glucose demand of resting brain activity. Furthermore, there is evidence that resting-state connectivity is more sensitive to the effects of alcohol intoxication on neuronal activity relative to CBF measures. Our results show that neither acute nor chronic alcohol affect FCD indices in the whole brain (Supp. Table 4).

To alleviate the concern that the group differences might be driven by gender imbalance,  between NM and HD, we performed group comparisons after excluding the female participants from the NM group.

A range of ROIs contributed to predicting cognitive performance in HD, who also performed worse on a range of cognitive tasks relative to NM.
