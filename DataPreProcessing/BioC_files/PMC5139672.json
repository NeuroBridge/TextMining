The CNP focused on two phenotype domains\u2014memory/working memory and response inhibition\u2014because these neurocognitive domains have been examined across multiple levels of analysis and are relevant to multiple neuropsychiatric syndromes. To examine these domains the CNP collected interviews and rating scales, self-report measures, neurocognitive exams using both paper-pencil and computerized tests, and neuroimaging data comprising structural MRI (sMRI), high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), and functional MRI (fMRI) both at rest (rsfMRI) and during five different cognitive activation paradigms. The CNP was committed to the perspective that most phenotypes should be considered dimensional until evidence of categorical structure was clear, and for this reason focused most on assessing phenotypes across a broad range of healthy people rather than specific groups representing individuals with neuropsychiatric syndromes. The CNP sample additionally included smaller groups of people who had diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (following DSM-IV), to determine where these individuals\u2019 scores would fall with respect to the distributions observed in healthy individuals. The CNP was one of 9 Interdisciplinary Research Consortia supported by the NIH Roadmap Initiative from 2007\u20132012.

Quality assurance was performed using a semi-automated method, including the following steps: confirmed that the b-values and applied directions were the same as expected, calculated mean in-mask FA and average or mean diffusivity (AD, MD), calculated and plotted motion, created a standard deviation image based on regular and motion corrected files, and used regional maps to calculate the percentage of cropped voxels in the occipital lobe, frontal lobe, temporal lobes, cerebellum, and the most superior portion of the brain. Trained individuals then used the results of this script to evaluate scan quality. This included a visual inspection of the FA map, visual inspection of the color map to ensure tracts were coded correctly, a check for cropping in which if more than 10 percent of voxels in a region were cropped, the map was visually inspected to ensure that the cropped region did not encroach on a major tract (i.e., regions that would be included in the FSL DTI skeleton), and the raw data were watched as a movie. Data were flagged for coverage (0=no cropping, 1=minor cropping, 2=severe unuseable cropping), motion (based on watching raw data as movie, and on motion plots), tensor direction flags (based on b-value and direction calculations, and on observation of the color map), artifact flags (including noise, striping, and the vibration artifact that affected many Siemens Trio systems during this time period).
