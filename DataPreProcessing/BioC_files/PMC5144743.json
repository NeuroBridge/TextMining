Alcohol and stress cues have consistently been shown to increase craving and relapse risk in recovering alcohol dependent (AUD) patients. However, differences in functional connectivity in response to these cues have not been studied using data-driven approaches. Here, voxel-wise connectivity is used in a whole-brain investigation of functional connectivity differences associated with alcohol and stress cues and to examine whether these differences are related to subsequent relapse. In Study 1, 45, 4- to 8-week abstinent, recovering AUD patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during individualized imagery of alcohol, stress, and neutral cues. Relapse measures were collected prospectively for 90\u00a0days post-discharge from inpatient treatment. AUD patients showed blunted anterior (ACC), mid (MCC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), voxel-wise connectivity responses to stress compared to neutral cues and blunted PCC response to alcohol compared to neutral cues. Using Cox proportional hazard regression, weaker connectivity in ACC and MCC during neutral exposure was associated with longer time to relapse (better recovery outcome). Similarly, greater connectivity in PCC during alcohol-cue compared to stress cue was associated with longer time to relapse. In Study 2, a sub-group of 30 AUD patients were demographically-matched to 30 healthy control (HC) participants for group comparisons.

Alcohol cues elicit reward responses in the brain. Studies have reported alcohol-related neuroadaptive changes in the brain circuits of alcohol dependent individuals, such that continued alcohol abuse increases incentive salience toward alcohol stimuli by altering the neural connectivity in reward and salience circuits. Together, our findings of reduced cingulate connectivity specific to alcohol cue in AUD patients suggest that prolonged alcohol consumption in AUD individuals may sensitize and alter cingulate connectivity in response to alcohol cues, probably resulting from their incentive salience to alcohol-associated stimuli. Further, our findings suggest that AUD patients with cingulate connectivity most similar to HC participants appear to have the most favorable relapse outcomes, emphasizing the crucial role of intact cingulate connectivity in maintaining alcohol abstinence.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26263, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Taken together, the current study using the ICD analysis sheds new light on the understanding of alcoholism by providing neural connectivity evidence that may underlie brain activity patterns using conventional task-based fMRI method. We report that that altered cingulate connectivity significantly contribute to alcohol-related pathology that is also significant for clinical outcomes of early relapse risk. Our prior task-based study identified hyperactivity in the vmPFC and parietal cortex (including the precuneus) during neutral states as key predictors of early relapse. The vmPFC and parietal lobes are anatomically interconnected with the cingulate cortex with the former more connected with the ACC and the latter with the PCC. Excessive connectivity during neutral states in the cingulate cortex may result in increased information transfer and processing, which may lead to hyper-reactivity in these regions. These results suggest that alcoholism may be characterized by abnormal activity in the medial PFC and precuneus, with underlying altered cingulate connectivity that bridges between these regions. Our finding highlights the importance of using ICD in understanding more comprehensive picture of alcohol pathology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27498, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study has several strengths including well-matched groups, successful prospective follow-up of AUD patients 90\u00a0days post-discharge from treatment, a well-validated individualized imagery task, and a novel, voxel-wise data-driven connectivity method. This study also has several limitations including a largely male population, the lack of pre-treatment connectivity data, and the lack of resting-state fMRI data. Sex differences in connectivity and cue reactivity exist in healthy individuals, and, thus, may mask subtle changes in AUD connectivity. Research suggests that nicotine use can alter network dynamics of the cingulate in possibly similar ways. Given the extensive comorbidity between alcohol and nicotine addiction found in general and clinical populations as well as in current study, it may be difficult to fully disentangle effects of alcohol dependency from effects of nicotine usage. However, it should be noted that the current study included smoking status as a covariate, and within the AUD group, cingulate connectivity predicted early relapse, suggesting a significant contribution of chronic alcohol abuse over and above nicotine effects with important clinical implication for alcohol addiction pathology. Comparisons of pre- and post-treatment data with paired connectivity methods could improve connectivity's predictive power of relapse and the assessment of treatment efficacy. Unlike standard block or event-related imagery paradigms, our imagery paradigm included two 2.5-min blocks of continuous imagery data providing a sufficient amount of data for robust data-driven connectivity analyses. While this approach could be a strength allowing for the exploration of the neurobiology of relapse due to alcohol and stress cues, task-based fMRI studies can be limited in a clinical setting. Future studies should additionally examine resting-state connectivity to more comprehensively understand the clinical profile of alcohol addiction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29469, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29481, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Functional connectivity of the cingulate cortex was identified as a key factor in the neurobiological response to alcohol and stress cues in AUD patients and a marker of later relapse.
