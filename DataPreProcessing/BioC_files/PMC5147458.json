The primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between adversity in childhood and striatal dopamine function in early adulthood. Secondary objectives were to compare exposure to childhood adversity and striatal dopamine function in young people at ultra high risk (UHR) of psychosis and healthy volunteers. Sixty-seven young adults, comprising 47 individuals at UHR for psychosis and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited from the same geographic area and were matched for age, gender and substance use. Presynaptic dopamine function in the associative striatum was assessed using 18F-DOPA positron emission tomography.

Within the sample as a whole, both severe physical or sexual abuse (T63\u00a0=\u00a02.92; P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and unstable family arrangements (T57\u00a0=\u00a02.80; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) in childhood were associated with elevated dopamine function in the associative striatum in adulthood.
