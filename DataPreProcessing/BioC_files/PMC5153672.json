Moreover, this unique study will enable us to test whether an early alcohol prevention intervention produces protective effects on brain structure, function and connectivity in adolescents, while controlling for potential pre-morbid factors associated with a susceptibility to early onset drinking. By focusing on the neural correlates of adolescents at risk for harmful drinking, and by examining the effects of adolescent drinking and binge drinking on the development of brain structure and function, the study will extend the knowledge gained from other large-scale studies (e.g., European Commission FP6-Health www.imagen-europe.com and National Institutes of Health\u2019s \u201cLongitudinal Studies on the Impact of Adolescent Drinking on the Adolescent Brain\u201d). Perhaps more importantly, this innovative experimental design will allow us to test the causal relationship between early alcohol exposure and neurocognitive and addiction outcomes by showing that delaying drinking in those most at-risk protects normal neurocognitive development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24441, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The main strengths of the study are that (i) the selection, intervention and measurement models are highly time-sensitive, capturing critical periods (12\u201314 and 14\u201316 years of age) when personality endophenotypes translate to risk for binge drinking and when early intervention can produce preventative effects. Furthermore, (ii) this critical period appears to overlap with the age at which drinking onset is highly related to future drinking, and when important brain maturation occurs. In addition, (iii) this research design is highly powered as our screening procedure, which is largely based on personality assessment at 12\u201313 years of age, identifies individuals, SS and IMP youth, for whom binge drinking is almost certain to develop within the next 12\u00a0months. Our previous research has shown that at 13\u00a0years of age, high SS and IMP adolescents have normal rates of drinking and binge drinking (around 40%), but experience a rapid rate of onset of binge drinking between 14 and 15\u00a0years of age, with approximately 95% reporting binge drinking at 15\u00a0years of age. We will also be able to (iv) test critical questions on the causal pathway from premorbid risk markers to early onset drinking, disruptions in brain function and, in turn, addiction outcomes. Finally, by being embedded into a larger population-based 5-year longitudinal randomized controlled trial, we will be able to directly (v) test the generalizability of our sample and findings to the general population, which is unique for pediatric neuroimaging studies, which tend to involve highly selective clinical samples or families with high education and socio-economic characteristics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26100, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Harmful alcohol use in early adolescence is associated with a more severe and protracted course of adult alcohol abuse and dependence and greater risk for severe psychiatric and other consequences of drinking. While these facts clearly indicate a need to focus our efforts on early intervention and prevention, particularly with vulnerable groups, only a fraction of the annual health budget dedicated to the treatment of substance abuse goes toward alcohol and drug prevention. This research will directly feed public knowledge on the harms associated with youth alcohol misuse, as well as the evidence base for selective interventions. The expected results will show direct effects of drinking on brain development and the benefits of early intervention and prevention efforts, effects that will be difficult to ignore in public policy
