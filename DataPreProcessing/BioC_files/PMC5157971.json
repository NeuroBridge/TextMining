In this study, we aimed to address whether thalamic nuclear groups show altered functional connectivity within the cerebral cortex in chronic ketamine users. One hundred and thirty subjects (41 ketamine users and 89 control subjects) underwent rsfMRI (resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Based on partial correlation functional connectivity analysis we partitioned the thalamus into six nuclear groups that correspond well with human histology. Then, in the area of each nuclear group, the functional connectivity differences between the chronic ketamine user group and normal control group were investigated. We found that the ketamine user group showed significantly less connectivity between the thalamic nuclear groups and the cortical regions-of-interest, including the prefrontal cortex, the motor cortex /supplementary motor area, and the posterior parietal cortex. However, no increased thalamic connectivity was observed for these regions as compared with controls.

Specifically, in the T map of one sample t-test of the thalamocortical connectivity of the drug-free control subjects (as shown in Fig 1B in the main manuscript), the voxel with the peak T value and its surrounding region with a relatively large T value (75% ~ 85% of the peak T value for different ROIs) was extracted as an ROI. Only right thalami ROIs are extracted. Then, we checked that the six ROIs contained no overlapping regions. In detail, the ROI_1 (dark blue) was located at the anterior and dorsomedial regions of the right thalamus, the ROI_2 (light blue) was located at ventral lateral portions of the thalamus, the ROI_3 (dark green) was located at ventral posterior-lateral portions of the thalamus, the ROI_4 (light green) was located at the posterior nucleus and the pulvinar, and the ROI_5 (red) and ROI_6 (yellow) were located at posterior medial and lateral areas of the thalamus, respectively (Fig 3). Next, the average fMRI time course was extracted from each thalamus ROI. Using these time courses, partial correlations were computed for each voxel in the brain. Then, the one sample t-test was used to obtain connectivity patterns of each thalamus ROI, separately for the drug free control subject group and the ketamine user group, as shown in Fig 4. We think that these connectivity patterns are very consistent with our hypothesis, that is, different thalamic nuclei have significant distinctive connection patterns with the cortex. For example, the thalamus ROI_1 shows strong connections with the prefrontal cortex, while the thalamus ROI_2 shows significant connection with the primary motor cortex and the supplementary motor area. In summary, we believe these results of thalamocortical connectivity are relatively reliable and are grounds for further testing. Finally, we used a two-sample t-test to investigate whether there were significant differences in the functional connectivity patterns of thalamus ROIs between the two groups. The significant decrease in thalamocortical connectivity in the ketamine user group is represented by the dotted purple lines in Fig 5.

We found that ketamine dependent subjects show significantly less connectivity between the thalamus and the cortical regions-of-interest, including the prefrontal cortex, the motor cortex /supplementary motor area, and the posterior parietal cortex.

However, another similar RSFC study revealed that the administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine significantly increased cortico-thalamic connectivity of the somatosensory and temporal cortex. One possible reason for this inconsistency may be due to the purpose of the study, the former is for treatment-resistant depression and the latter is for a schizophrenia model. Thus, these two studies focused on different circuit connectivity using similar methods.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25552, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Considering that addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease and a state of compulsive drug use, it can include tolerance, dependence and withdrawal symptoms. And the disrupted circuit connectivity in addictive drug users may inform specific neurobiological substrates associated with addiction.. Here, we discuss results from additional RSFC studies dealing with other types of substance addiction. A line of study demonstrated decreased functional connectivity in addiction of other drugs (such as cocaine and heroine). For example, a study on cocaine administration followed by fMRI observed decreased functional connectivity in the human primary visual and motor cortex after acute administration of cocaine. In addition, Kelly et al. found reduced prefrontal interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in cocaine-dependent participants compared to control subjects. By whole-brain resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis, Gu et al. reported almost universally reduced functional connectivity strength for six functional networks regions (ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) of the thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and rostral anterior cingulate cortex) in cocaine users. They also found that the MD thalamus seed yielded decreased rsFC within extensive striatal regions and impaired mesocorticolimbic circuits for the cocaine group. These regions are thought to be important for focusing and maintaining desired behaviors while suppressing unwanted behaviors. Drug dependent subjects are known to have difficulties with response inhibition, which likely contributes to the propensity to relapse in the presence of drug related cues. However, both decreased and increased functional connectivity have been reported in heroin users. For example, Ma et al. found increased functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and ventral/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the nucleus accumbens and orbital frontal cortex (OFC), the amygdala and OFC, and decreased functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and OFC and between prefrontal cortex and ACC. Additionally, evidence shows increased functional connectivity in the right hippocampus and decreased functional connectivity in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the left caudate in the default mode network (DMN) in 14 chronic heroin users compared with 13 non-addicted controls. Using graph theory analysis (GTA), Liu et al. found dysfunctional brain connectivity among several brain regions in the network of chronic heroin users that may contribute to decreased self-control, impaired inhibitory function, as well deficits in stress regulation in twelve chronic heroin users when compared with twelve controls.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28310, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "However, these are only a few studies that have examined addiction-related alterations in thalamocortical connectivity directly. Thalamocortical integration deficits in instrumental learning and performance could contribute to drug addiction as it often causes deficits in cognitive and emotional processes. With 54 cocaine dependent patients and 54 age and gender matched healthy adult subjects, a simple reaction time task-fMRI study showed alteration of error-related thalamic- ventral medial prefrontal cortex connectivity, which is associated with impaired self-control in patients with cocaine dependence. An animal study with electroencephalography (EEG) examined thalamocortical function in vivo and in vitro in mice after a cocaine \u201cbinge\u201d administration. It illustrated that thalamocortical dysfunctions in a cocaine hydrochloride \u201cbinge\u201d might be observed as a result of two distinct but additive events: 1. An increase in low frequency oscillatory thalamocortical activity and 2. Over-inhibition of ventrobasal neurons that can abnormally \u201clock\u201d the whole thalamocortical system at low frequencies, ultimately inducing a thalamocortical dysrhythmia-like state. Considering the key role of the thalamus in information transmission, processing, and basic corticocortical communication, examining the possible roles of the thalamus in addiction, as well as identifying open questions and exploring ways to address them may provide a more precise understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of addiction.

Functional brain imaging in humans and animals has revealed an interconnected set of cortical and limbic brain regions that are involved in associative learning and prove to be an underlying theme for craving and relapse (see review).

First, although ketamine use participants did not meet dependence for any other substances except nicotine they may have engaged in other substance use and as such would be different from the controls in this regard. Second, the ketamine and control groups differed in smoking status and education. Although our analyses suggested that decreased thalamocortical functional connectivity observed are unlikely to reflect group differences in smoking and educational levels, future studies should match groups on smoking status and levels of education. Third, as is typical of studies in drug dependent populations, the sample was predominantly male. The potential role of gender differences should be examined in future studies.
