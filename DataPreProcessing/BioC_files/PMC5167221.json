Regular drug users (N\u00a0=\u00a0122) received acute doses of cannabis (450\u00a0\u03bcg/kg THC), cocaine HCl 300\u00a0mg and placebo. Cognitive impulse control was assessed by means of the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT). Resting state fMRI was measured in a subset of participants to determine functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and (sub)cortical areas. The influence of cannabis and cocaine on impulsivity and functional connectivity significantly interacted with DBH genotype. Both drugs increased cognitive impulsivity in participants with CT/TT genotypes but not in CC participants. Both drugs also reduced functional connectivity between the NAc and the limbic lobe, prefrontal cortex, striatum and thalamus and primarily in individuals with CT/TT genotypes. Correlational analysis indicated a significant negative association between cognitive impulsivity and functional connectivity in subcortical areas of the brain. It is concluded that interference of cannabis and cocaine with cognitive impulse control and functional corticostriatal connectivity depends on DBH genotype.

The latter constitutes a cortico-subcortical network that receives modulatory input to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) from ascending dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (Alexander et al.; Bonelli and Cummings; Perreault et al.). The circuit broadly consists of a reflective system located in the medial prefrontal cortex and a reactive system located in the striatum. The reactive system is sensitive to reward and generates impulses following dopaminergic stimulation of the NAc whereas the reflective system operates glutamatergic control over impulses generated in the striatum (Bechara; Faure et al.; Kalivas and Volkow). All drugs of abuse increase dopamine transmission in the NAc (Nestler) which is essential for acute drug reward (Dagher and Robbins; Kalivas and Volkow; Volkow et al.) and may be very relevant for progressively shaping drug use into drug seeking behavior (Kalivas) by reducing inhibitory control over the reactive system (D\u2019Amour-Horvat and Leyton).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3099, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Vulnerability to drug addiction and loss of inhibitory control may be affected by inter-individual variations in genetic expression and tonic dopamine levels in the limbic circuit (Koob; Kreek et al.; Volkow et al.).

A prime factor influencing tonic dopamine in the brain is the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (D\u03b2H) (Hess et al.; Kreek et al.; Weinshenker and Schroeder) that catalyzes the biotransformation of dopamine into noradrenaline. A polymorphism in the DBH encoding gene, the single nucleotide polymorphism rs 1611115 (\u2212970C-T, formerly known as -1021C\u00a0>\u00a0T) accounts for up to 50\u00a0% of the variance in the D\u03b2H enzyme activity (Zabetian et al.). Individuals with the high activity CC genotype are expected to display low levels of dopamine. Individuals with low activity genotypes (CT and TT) are expected to display high levels of dopamine and have been associated with impulsive personality styles (Hess et al.).

The former changed from a reflective decision style during placebo (i.e. low impulsivity scores) to an impulsive decision style during drug intoxication (i.e. higher impulsivity scores). This is illustrated by the finding that CT/TT participants responded more rapidly at the cost of making more errors during cocaine and made more errors despite prolonged decision times during cannabis intoxication. CC homozygotes revealed relatively high impulsivity scores during placebo that did not alter during drug intoxication. Single doses of cannabis (Ramaekers et al.) and cocaine (van Wel et al.) have previously been reported to increase motor and cognitive impulsivity, particularly at higher doses (Fillmore et al.) or higher drug concentrations (Ramaekers et al.).

In particular, cannabis and cocaine decreased functional connectivity between the NAc and the limbic lobe (i.e. anterior cingulate), medial prefrontal cortex, striatum and thalamus. Reductions in functional connectivity were most prominent in individuals with CT/TT genotypes. These decrements may be largely related to the moderating effects of cannabis and cocaine on GABAergic projections to output nuclei within the basal ganglia. Both drugs elevate dopamine levels in the NAc (Bossong et al.; Kalivas and Duffy; Weiss et al.) which in turn increases inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission to the ventral pallidum through D1 receptor stimulation in the direct pathway. Inhibitory output to the ventral pallidum leads to reduction of GABAergic, inhibitory tone to the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, which, in turn, projects to the limbic areas of the cerebral cortex (Kalivas and Volkow; Nakanishi et al.; Pierce and Kumaresan). In addition, dopamine also turns down the inhibitory, indirect striatal pathway from the NAc to the thalamus via D2 receptor activation (Nakanishi et al.). The net effect of dopaminergic stimulation of D1 and D2 receptors in the NAc is therefore \u2018disinhibition\u2019 and increased thalamic feedback on pleasure and reward to the cerebral cortex. Loss of functional connectivity may reflect elevation of striatal \u2018bottom-up\u2019 impulses at the cost of \u2018reflective\u2019 top-down control from frontal parts in the limbic circuit. Indeed, correlational analyses confirm a strong association between cognitive impulsivity and functional connectivity in the subcortical areas (i.e. striatum, thalamus) of the brain. Impulsivity increased with lower functional connectivity in these areas, and this association was strongest in the drug conditions. This corresponds with the notion of striatal overdrive due to increased dopaminergic stimulation of the NAc and the subsequent \u2018disinhibition\u2019 of the thalamus which acts as the major relay between the reactive and reflective part of the reward system.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30447, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Drug induced disinhibition of corticostriatal circuits and subsequent loss of cognitive control may also provide an important mechanism by which drug users can progress to drug seeking. In the present study, loss of functional corticostriatal connectivity was particularly prominent in the (supracallosal) anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. These areas are implicated in detection of salient or erroneous events and the signaling of top down reorientation and implementation of attention (Beckmann et al.; Sutherland et al.). Reduced brain activity in these areas has been associated with comprised abilities to exert control over strong prepotent urges in cocaine users (Hester and Garavan). Reductions in functional corticostriatal connectivity have also been reported in chronic users of cocaine (Camchong et al.; Gu et al.; Tomasi et al.) and cannabis (Fischer et al.) during abstinence.

First, sample size in the current study, appears low to study genetic polymorphism. It has been argued that sample size should be well above a hundred participants or more to reliable assess genetic \u2013environment (e.g. drug) interactions (Duncan and Keller). The implication of a low sample size is that true genotype \u00d7 drug effects may go undetected or that rate of false discoveries progressively increases with the number of candidate genes that are being screened for drug interactions (Duncan and Keller). This argument is particularly true for association studies that randomly screen for a multitude of candidate gene-drug interactions. However, the present experimental study instead tested a single hypothesis about a single candidate gene (i.e. DBH) to exclude risk of chance capitalization and type 1 statistical errors. In such a scenario, sample size considerations are essentially not different from those in any other study making between group comparisons. The current study was well powered to demonstrate drug x DBH interactions in the MFFT. Sample size for resting state data was lower, but still within a sufficient range to pick up drug effects as demonstrated in previous studies (Honey et al.; Kelly et al.; Ramaekers et al.; Schrantee et al.). Moreover, pearson r correlations between functional connectivity and MFFT demonstrated a significant association between these 2 datasets, with coefficients varying between r\u00a0=\u00a0\u221230 and r\u00a0=\u00a0\u221250 indicating medium to large effect sizes.
