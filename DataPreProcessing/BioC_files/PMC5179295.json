Extending these results using a complementary neuroimaging modality, magnetoencephalography (MEG), we present the first direct comparison of functional connectivity between schizophrenia patients and controls, using these two modalities combined. We developed a novel MEG approach for estimation of networks using MEG that incorporates spatial independent component analysis (ICA) and pairwise correlations between independent component timecourses, to estimate intra- and intern-network connectivity. This analysis enables group-level inference and testing of between-group differences. Resting state MEG and fMRI data were acquired from a large sample of healthy controls (n=45) and schizophrenia patients (n=46). Group spatial ICA was performed on fMRI and MEG data to extract intrinsic fMRI and MEG networks and to compensate for signal leakage in MEG. Similar, but not identical spatial independent components were detected for MEG and fMRI. Analysis of functional network connectivity (FNC; i.e., pairwise correlations in network (ICA component) timecourses) revealed a differential between-modalities pattern, with greater connectivity among occipital networks in fMRI and among frontal networks in MEG. Most importantly, significant differences between controls and patients were observed in both modalities. MEG FNC results in particular indicated dysfunctional hyperconnectivity within frontal and temporal networks in patients, while in fMRI FNC was always greater for controls than for patients. This is the first study to apply group spatial ICA as an approach to leakage correction, and as such our results may be biased by spatial leakage effects. Results suggest that combining these two neuroimaging modalities reveals additional disease-relevant patterns of connectivity that were not detectable with fMRI or MEG alone.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2106, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Analysis of resting state data has yielded information across a wide range of topics including basic sensory processing, tobacco and alcohol use, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Resting state protocols are particularly advantageous for the study of disease states where patients may have difficulty responding or performing behavioral tasks due to compromised cognitive and/or physiological functions. Connectivity methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) are a set of powerful analysis techniques used to analyze resting brain activity. Such approaches are particularly relevant to disease states such as schizophrenia, in which dysfunctional connectivity (\u201cdysconnectivity\u201d) is hypothesized to underlie patient symptoms. Because this dysconnectivity is thought to be driven by aberrant synaptic plasticity, characterizing functional connectivity may be essential to understanding the disorder.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3177, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Group independent component analysis (gICA) is an effective means of interrogating functional dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. As typically applied to resting fMRI data, this technique identifies and reconstructs temporally-coherent, spatially-independent networks in groups of subjects, where \u201cnetworks\u201d are defined as components identified via ICA. Spatial independence facilitates the comparison of topographies, or maps, between groups, while the property of temporal coherence permits the assessment of interregional, connectivity between spatially independent networks. However, exclusive reliance on fMRI to generate such networks may limit inference on dysconnectivity: Whilst the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) response measured by fMRI allows high spatial resolution maps, it is limited by being an indirect and slow physiological signal. Neural oscillatory activity, which comprises rhythmic electrical activity in cell assemblies, is thought to underlie BOLD responses. This occurs in the ~1\u2013900Hz band; such rapid electrical signals cannot be assessed using fMRI but can be measured directly by techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), a noninvasive neuroimaging technique used to infer the cortical current distribution via assessment of the induced extra-cranial magnetic fields. Measurement of resting state brain activity using both fMRI and MEG, within a common sample of subjects, combines the strengths of each modality by allowing comparison of haemodynamic and electrophysiological effects. In this way we provide significant insight into functional connectivity, with special relevance for the study of schizophrenia and similar conditions. Significant progress towards integrating MEG and fMRI has been made in the past decade. MEG inverse solutions such now permit functional connectivity analysis in the same brain space as fMRI. This approach has already been used to evaluate intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in MEG in a similar way to that typically used in fMRI.

On the whole, our resting fMRI FNC findings converge with the schizophrenia literature, which reports hypoactivation across multiple regions, including the prefrontal cortex. However, prefrontal FNC with MEG was increased in our patient group. This suggests abnormally increased synchronous firing from neuronal populations in prefrontal networks in these chronically ill schizophrenia patients. Whether these hyper-synchronous networks underlie core deficits of the illness or represent compensation to overcome other primary functional defects, we cannot say. However, we did not find correlations with positive symptoms, which have been reported to be associated with fMRI functional hyper-connectivity. Our results suggesting hyper-synchronous prefrontal networks are consistent with the dysconnectivity model of schizophrenia and suggest that these represent a deficit at the neuronal population level and not merely in the coupling of vascular/neuronal function.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28751, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the present study, the combination of data from multiple modalities, collected at different times, conveys additional confidence in our results. For instance, one critique of resting fMRI data from populations with mental illness or disease is that patients may respond differentially to auditory scanner noise. We observed bilateral temporal components in fMRI, which has substantial background noise during scans, and unilateral temporal components in MEG, which is silent, providing some support for this critique. Similarly, schizophrenia patients have well-known autonomic nervous system dysregulation related to variability in heart rate and respiration which can directly affect the BOLD response. However, the electromagnetic signal detected by MEG is less affected, particularly when the cardiac signal has been removed as in the present study. Overlapping MEG-fMRI components can reasonably be assumed to be free of such influences, revealing only the underlying dysregulation. Finally, eye movements also differ between controls and patients, again directly affecting the BOLD signal, where changes in the flow of vitreous humor during eye movement increase signal variance from nearby regions. The corneo-retinal potential can affect electrophysiological signals, but generally would appear as a source between the eyes. In the present study, such eye movement artifacts were reduced through the application of SSP. Surviving frontal and occipital components that are in common for MEG and fMRI are arguably free of such modality-specific artifacts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30316, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Point spread \u2013 that is, the leakage of signal between projected timecourses \u2013 is a ubiquitous issue in beamformer analysis. In connectivity analysis, signal leakage manifests as zero-lag correlation between timecourses of spatially separate regions. Connectivity analysis of beamformer-projected timecourses without leakage correction will therefore lead to spurious connectivity estimates if one simply computes the connectivity between two source signals. Because signal leakage varies with sensor geometry, brain region, sensor noise, inverse solution, and the sparseness of the source space, no universal correction for leakage exists. The predominant approaches to correcting for leakage rely to some degree upon removing or ignoring zero-order correlations between timecourses. This includes partial correlation approaches, and, in phase-based connectivity, either analysis of the asymmetry of the phase distribution or removal of the real portion of coherence. Such approaches can be problematic because they discard true zero-order relationships, throwing out the signal \u2018baby\u2019 with the leakage \u2018bathwater\u2019. Further, these approaches are problematic because they rely to varying degrees on the assumption that brain sources are point sources rather than distributed sources. However, research in intracranial EEG has demonstrated that cortical sources are often distributed over at least 10 cm2 of the cortical surface (Chowdhury 2013, Huiskamp 2010) \u2013 that is, spatially-distributed sources detected via MEG may represent true distributed sources in the cortex. Therefore, even if an all-to-all voxelwise leakage correction were practical, it would be inadvisable, as it could broadly suppress true source extents ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32040, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given this, group spatial independent component analysis (sICA) may eventually provide a preferable form of leakage correction for FNC-based studies. In this data-driven technique for unmixing complex brain signals, the unmixing procedure produces a set of maximally independent network topologies (i.e., component maps), with timecourses that may be inter-related. Relationships among these networks can then be evaluated, as in the present study, using functional network connectivity (FNC). The leakage of signal among MEG sensors typically manifests as linear spatial blurring of the sources (cf.). This blurring will inflate the connectivity among cross-correlated sensor signals, potentially producing spurious estimates of connectivity if not addressed. However, such a signal is well-suited to unmixing by sICA, and when present may manifest as a spatial blurring of each individual component. The connectivity among these components might be relatively less influenced by leakage in such a scenario, as the ICA unmixing procedure may be expected to capture both source and leakage within a single component, as both source and leakage are by definition quite highly related. In the present study, our approach and statistical testing is focused on the cross-correlation among gICA-derived timecourses and as such the effects of signal leakage on these estimates of connectivity might be expected to be low. However, such claims need to be directly evaluated, a task which is beyond the scope of the current work but which we are pursuing in a separate paper. Should this approach be supported in our follow-up work, it may ultimately prove inadvisable to perform a separate leakage correction step if one is testing gICA-based among-component connectivity, or FNC. However, given the novelty of this approach, we need to mention that it is possible that FNC results presented in the present study are biased to some extent by signal leakage.

First, although this study combined MEG and fMRI, data from each modality were collected and analyzed separately, albeit in parallel. Techniques for true whole-brain multi-modal data fusion remain elusive, and potential sources of inter-modality differences such as the day of the scan and time of the scan cannot be ruled out. Second, although substantial spatial overlap was observed for MEG and fMRI, there was minimal overlap in the patterns of connectivity (i.e., FNC) between MEG and fMRI. This may be due to some sample-specific idiosyncrasies, to the differing sensitivities of FNC analysis between the two modalities, or to some combination of these factors. The optimal approach to addressing these issues is via replication in similar samples, which we hope to pursue in a future study. Third, while multiple MEG frequency bands were examined, this portion of the analysis was exploratory in nature. Future work should examine between-group effects both within frequency and across frequencies, an approach that will require a larger sample to ensure adequate power to detect such effects. Fourth, the inversion of MEG data from measurement channels to brain sources is an ill-posed problem, with approximately 300 measurement channels in most commercial devices, but thousands of potential sources in the brain. Although sources with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be resolved with separation of 0.5 mm using a beamformer approach, lower SNR data such as that obtained in resting studies will typically lead to local blurring of source activity. Fifth, while the ICA decomposition assumes a linear relationship between the derived components and the source signal, the BOLD signal and MEG source envelopes analyzed in the present study are themselves nonlinear functions of the true source signals, and the extent to which the ICA accurately represents this nonlinearity is unclear. Finally, although the present study used spatial ICA as an approach to leakage correction, it may be the case that the ICA unmixing procedure does not adequately compensate for leakage. A detailed simulation study testing this approach, while beyond the scope of the present study, is now in process.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36936, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.2 Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36951, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present study employed a novel approach to estimate intrinsic connectivity networks from group spatial ICA of fMRI and MEG data to evaluate spatial patterns and functional connectivity in a sample of schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers. This is the first study to use group spatial ICA with resting MEG data, and also the first to apply these methods to directly compare a patient population to healthy volunteers. We observed substantial spatial overlap in multiple intrinsic connectivity networks as assessed using spatial correlation. We also observed intermodality differences in functional network connectivity of ICNs, with more instances of high frontal FNC for MEG and high occipital FNC for fMRI. In addition, while group differences in network spatial topography were observed primarily in frontal regions for fMRI, in MEG these differences were observed more broadly in frontal and temporal networks. The results suggest hyper-synchronous prefrontal networks in schizophrenia with deficits at the neuronal population level and not merely in neurovascular coupling. The spatial consistency of components from MEG and fMRI, based on data collected on different days, also allows us to rule out several alternative explanations for the observed results, including modality-specific scanner and environmental noise.
