The Five Factor Model (FFM) is a widely accepted framework that organizes personality traits along five dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Neuroticism, the most frequently examined of these in AUD studies, entails the tendency to experience negative emotions including anger, anxiety, depression and vulnerability. Neuroticism can be quantified with the standardized NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEOFFI). Those high in neuroticism are more likely to be impacted by persistent negative feelings. While personality traits, including neuroticism, are considered stable and enduring aspects of individuals with substantial heritability, it has been argued that personality can affect alcohol consumption or shape the development of AUD. Studies have indicated that neuroticism is positively correlated with AUD or variation in drinking patterns. Hicks et al. reported the interesting finding that negative emotionality traits at age 11 predict the onset and course (persistence vs. desistence) of AUD and that the course of AUD can affect the rate of personality change.

More than a dozen fMRI studies that included cognitive tasks involving emotional conflict or facial stimuli processing have suggested that neuroticism is strongly associated with activity in amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) although medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and insula are also involved. In addition, a recent fMRI study found that right superior parietal cortex activation in the task-independent default mode network was negatively correlated with neuroticism.

Rational for the use of this two-stage procedure can be found in Supplementary Material S2 1 . We assumed that only few brain regions were relevant. In screening stage, the main goal is to identifying a subset of potentially relevant brain regions. The L2Boosting algorithm was used to select a subset of potentially relevant brain regions. Specifically, a linear model with neuroticism as response variable was fitted by least squares method. Predictors in the linear model include cortical thickness in 68 regions, their interactions with AUD status, and a set of confounding variables. Next, L2Boosting iteratively fit the linear model to current least square residuals. The final boosting estimator was constructed via a linear combination of multiple estimates. To avoid overfitting, the Akaike Information Criterion stopping rule was employed to stop boosting at a suitable number of iterations. Analyses of brain-behavior relationships were focused only on the regions selected by the L2Boosting algorithm. In model testing stage, linear regression models, with each selected brain region as an outcome measure, were used to test whether there was a significant group by neuroticism effect.

Our vertex-based analysis revealed that the correlation between neuroticism and cortical thickness was predominantly affected by AUD status in both anterior and posterior subdivisions of the left insula. The literature on structure-functional relationships in the insula is conflicted. Bilateral insula damage was associated with loss of addictive craving, but reduction in insular cortical thickness has also been reported in cocaine addiction and in alcohol dependent subjects. In addition, substance users have been found to show reduced posterior insula activity during risky choice tasks, as well as increased insula activity in response to drug-related cues. In the same vein, severity of alcohol addiction has been positively associated with cue-induced insula activity. In cocaine addiction, insula involvement has been understood on the basis of interconnections with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in normative functioning of the reward system. Furthermore, the strong emotional states produced by substance abuse have been proposed to enhance insula connectivity, which in turn leads to strong associations between drugs of abuse and emotional states in drug abusing subjects.

Our vertex-based analysis result pinpointing both anterior and posterior subdivisions of the insula is consistent with the involvement of both these subdivisions in pain perception. Pain sensations evoked from various painful stimuli are relayed to dorsal posterior insula via the spinothalamocortical pathway and then integrated in the anterior subdivision. AUD has been increasingly viewed as a chronic pain disorder based on accumulating pathophysiological observation and brain imaging evidence. Alcohol administration is believed to trigger an initial rewarding and pain alleviating response, although excessive alcohol intoxication and withdrawal episodes can dysregulate brain stress and reward circuits. Such repeated episodes can lead to a persistent negative affective state that in turn motivates excessive alcohol consumption to restore the normal emotional state. Neuroticism score, which was higher in participants with AUDs than in HCs, has been reported to be negatively related to pain tolerance. The insula\u2019s fundamental role in human pain perception is further supported by its being the most consistently activated region in response to abnormal and induced pain. Finally, the insula is also activated in subjects with alcohol dependence during reward anticipation. Therefore, our observation in two independent data sets that the insula cortical thickness-neuroticism correlation differs in participants with AUD versus HCs may also be explained by the intriguing, albeit untested, hypothesis that insula cortex dysfunction, indexed by structural differences, may mediate the impact of alcohol consumption on affective pain states, consequently contributing to the development of AUDs.
