The ReHo abnormalities are a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and they provide insights into the biological mechanism of the disease. Zhan et al. experimentally demonstrated that ReHo may provide an objective biomarker for evaluating the functional abnormity of mild traumatic brain injury under acute settings. Liu et al. proposed that ReHo is a potential neuroimaging biomarker for distinguishing bipolar disorder patients experiencing a depressive episode and unipolar depression patients. Yuan et al. indicated that amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients show significant abnormal local coherence of biological activity in resting state, and ReHo can serve as a sensitive biomarker in functional imaging studies. In addition, Chen et al. suggested that ReHo can be helpful in detecting minimal hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients. The results of current study suggest that the ReHo values in the right superior frontal gyrus and left precuneus can be used to separate the smokers from the non-smokers. In particular, the left precuneus with the ReHo value that significantly correlates with the FTND score of smokers can be a potential neuroimaging biomarker for nicotine addicts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14008, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The function for the brain areas of superior frontal gyrus and precuneus was related to the working memory in previous studies. A structural network research had shown that the precuneus, middle frontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus exhibit significantly high connectivity indices, which are remarkably related to variations in working memory capacity. The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been navigated on the precuneus region, thereby resulting in a robust bilateral field advantage in visual short-term memory storage capacity. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients with memory impairment show significant hypoperfusion in the right precuneus compared with those with non-memory impairment; therefore, hypoperfusion of the precuneus may play a significant role in the memory function of systemic lupus erythematosus patients. The results of the present study imply that the smokers are significantly different from the non-smokers in terms of working memory. Studying the particular cognitive function of nicotine addicts is thus important.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15073, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The current study has several limitations.
