Neuroimaging, particularly functional neuroimaging, has provided a wealth of intriguing information regarding brain function, but has yet to show clear value to psychiatric diagnosis.

In a typical neuroimaging study there may be tens or hundreds of subjects, each with an image consisting of up to hundreds of thousands of voxels, resulting in an extremely underdetermined problem. A popular category of feature selection approaches is regularized regression techniques such as LASSO and related methods employing sparse models. Such supervised techniques impose task-specific information (the data labels), with a penalty term to incorporate prior knowledge. In the case of LASSO, the prior knowledge amounts to a presumption of sparsity on the relationship between image data and labels, i.e., that the underlying biological mechanism involves a limited number of the imaged voxels. Unfortunately, if the problem is both very underdetermined and very noisy, then the regularized solution may not be a particularly superior choice; many solutions may potentially be of similar or even equal probability to each other. For example in the underdetermined case, the LASSO solution may not be unique for highly-structured datasets.

An example is principal component analysis (PCA), which finds basis vectors for the space containing the data variation. This set of basis vectors can be viewed as robust in the sense that they are common to all solutions of any linear regression based on the data. In statistics a closely-related concept is estimable functions. We will refer to components with such a property as unambiguous, and examine this more formally in the next section. Of course such components only describe the data itself, not necessarily the aspects of the data pertinent to our application, such as for finding information most related to a disease phenotype. A common approach is to utilize PCA and related factoring methods in a supervised fashion by choosing a subset of factors which best correlate with the labels. Supervised factoring techniques such as the \u201cSupervised PCA\u201d of, and related methods, can be viewed as a more sophisticated version of this technique, finding a transformation of the data such that the correlation with the labels is maximized. However these techniques are not able to incorporate prior knowledge, such as sparsity of the mechanism, into this transformation. Techniques have been developed which do incorporate sparsity into unsupervised factoring techniques (e.g., sparse PCA) in a heuristic sense, though this differs from presuming sparsity of the underlying mechanism; the presumption of sparsity is applied to the structure of the component itself rather than to the unknown mechanism.

Of course there are far more unknown variables than samples, hence our linear system is underdetermined and there will be many possible x which solve the system. One way to address this problem is to impose prior knowledge about the biological mechanism, such as a preference for sparser x, and select the solution which best fulfills this preference. We will review this approach in a later section. Another approach is to restrict our analysis to components of the solution which may be more easily estimated, such as via dimensionality reduction; an intuitive example of this approach is to group voxels into low-resolution regions.

This equation tell us that, while we can't calculate the true x in the underdetermined case, we can calculate components of x corresponding to nonzero singular values.

Fig. 3 also gives the distributions for the scores computed by these components (i.e., the range of correlations with potential solutions), where we see that these two result in broad distributions.
