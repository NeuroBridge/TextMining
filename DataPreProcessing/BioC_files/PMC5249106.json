Disrupted brain development can lead to abnormal neural connectivity or network, which may cause abnormal information processing and integration, and clinical symptoms including psychosis. It has been well established that the insula cortex is an anatomical gateway between the visual, olfactory, auditory, somatosensory cortices and the limbic structures. Secluded deep within the lateral sulcus of the human brain, the insular cortex is part of an extended network of neuronal pathways connecting to the anterior cingulate cortex, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, and thalamus. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral inferior parietal cortex and middle temporal lobe are parts of default mode network (DMN). The central executive network (CEN) consists of mainly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The salience network (SN) includes primarily the anterior insular cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Apparentlythe insular cortex functions as a multimodal sensory integration region. In addition, the insular cortex plays an important role in emotion processing including interoceptive awareness, anticipation, evaluation of emotional stimuli, self-awareness, episodic memory, executive function, attention, and saliency processing.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3076, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, the insula cortex has attracted significant attention in schizophrenia research. The aberrant functional and structural alterations in insular cortex have been frequently reported in schizophrenia including reduced gray matter volume, thickness, and surface area, decreased white matter integrity (measured by fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity), and altered functional activity under various tasks or during resting state. Changes in the SN may be one of the most important findings among all insular cortex related networks in schizophrenia. Recently, the anterior insular cortex within the SN has been demonstrated to be crucial to modulate DMN /CEN interactions in patients with schizophrenia. Manoliu et al. also found that the dependence of CEN and DMN interactions on SN\u2019s right anterior insular activity is altered in patients with schizophrenia during acute psychosis or psychotic remission. Furthermore, insular cortical dysfunction might be associated with core symptoms of schizophrenia. Aberrant salience network activity in the insular and cingulate cortices has been implicated in the development of positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as delusions and hallucinations due to an inappropriate assignment of salience to stimuli that would normally be considered irrelevant. Patients with schizophrenia are usually suffer from impaired insight; both awareness and mental state attribution, two core components of insight, are associated with the function of insular cortex.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4583, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous studies have provided compelling evidence supporting the critical role of insular cortex in schizophrenia.

It has been reported that first-episode schizophrenia patients have bilateral Heschl\u2019s gyrus gray matter volume reduction, and decreased left Heschl\u2019s gyrus gray matter volume over time. Heschl's gyrus contains the primary auditory cortex (PAC), which is the first cortical structure to process incoming auditory information. The PAC is in close spatial proximity to the posteroinferior insular cortex. The auditory information related to prosodic processing may be conveyed to the posterior insular cortex directly through links with the primary auditory and association areas.

In addition, the correlation analysis found a significant positive relationship between the right insula-Heschl gyrus connectivity and the PANSS general psychopathology subscale scores, suggesting that an abnormally increased connectivity might contribute to the manifestation of clinical symptoms such as depression and anxiety observed in patients with schizophrenia. Symptoms of schizophrenia have been attributed to a failure of functional integration or aberrant connectivity among regions or systems of the brain. Manoliu et al. found that the right anterior insular cortical dysfunction was associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia during the acute phase of psychosis; they further suggested that the specific SN/DMN/CEN reorganization with distinct insular cortical pathways might be related to different symptom domains of schizophrenia. Another study reported that structural alterations of the insular cortex might be related to negative symptoms during psychotic remission, which is consist with our report about the negative correlation between the insular cortex-Heschl\u2019s gyrus connectivity in the left brain hemisphere and the PANSS negative symptoms. Lee et al. reported that progressive gray matter volume reduction in both insular cortex and temporal pole in first episode psychosis was inversely associated with changes in the overall Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale symptom scores. Some studies suggested that disturbances in emotional prosody is due to the impairment in early auditory sensory processing, which may contribute to later impairment in attention-dependent processes in schizophrenia.
