Individual differences in DD likely depend on variations in the activation of and functional interactions between networks, representing possible endophenotypes for associated disorders, including alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Numerous fMRI studies have probed the neural bases of DD, but investigations of large-scale networks remains scant. We addressed this gap by testing whether activation within large-scale networks during \u201cNow/Later\u201d decision-making predicts individual differences in DD. To do so, we scanned 95 social drinkers (18\u201340 years; 50 females) using fMRI during hypothetical choices between small monetary amounts available \u201ctoday\u201d or larger amounts available later. We identified neural networks engaged during Now/Later choice using independent component analysis (ICA) and tested the relationship between component activation and degree of DD. The activity of two components during Now/Later choice correlated with individual DD rates: a temporal lobe network positively correlated with DD, while a frontoparietal-striatal network negatively correlated with DD. Activation differences between these networks predicted individual differences in DD and their negative correlation during Now/Later choice suggests functional competition. A generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) analysis confirmed a decrease in their functional connectivity during decision-making. The functional connectivity of these two networks negatively correlates with alcohol-related harm, potentially implicating these networks in AUDs.

In such tasks, individuals vary considerably in their reward preference, demonstrating the highly subjective nature of intertemporal decision-making. A greater bias for sooner rewards, widely accepted as a form of impulsivity, is associated with addictive disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and eating disorders.

While this was a healthy, non-clinical sample, accumulating evidence suggests that excessive delay discounting may be a pre-existing intermediate phenotype for alcohol use disorders. Therefore, we probed whether connectivity between these brain networks was associated with aspects of subclinical alcohol use. Partial correlation analyses controlling for age and sex revealed a significant relationship between gPPI contrast estimates and the AUDIT subscale measuring harmful alcohol use (\u03c1=\u22120.26, p=0.013), but not the subscales measuring the quantity of alcohol consumption or alcohol dependence symptoms (p>0.05). The gPPI contrast estimates were unrelated to ICR (\u03c1=0.01, p=0.93), however, indicating that although activity levels of each of these networks during decision making predicts impulsive choices, the connectivity between them does not.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28051, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "DISCUSSION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28062, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study utilized a novel approach to identify neural networks associated with individual differences in immediate reward selection bias in healthy adults.

Activity within these two networks was inversely correlated during decision-making, and task-dependent decreases in connectivity between these networks indicate that these brain regions functionally compete during intertemporal choice.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28837, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Consilience with existing DD neuroimaging literature", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28890, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The independent component (#3) whose activity during intertemporal decision-making was negatively correlated with ICR (Fig. 4A) incorporated many brain regions previously proposed to comprise a cognitive control system central to favoring selection of delayed rewards. For example, reported enhanced activity in a constellation of areas with remarkable spatial similarities with Component 3, including the bilateral posterior parietal cortex, right dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and right inferior frontal cortex/anterior insula, when subjects opted for larger, later rewards. Several studies have also identified similar activity related to DD in brain regions corresponding to a right-lateralized frontal-parietal network, whereas others emphasize the role of the left lateral prefrontal cortex in overriding impulsive choices. Notably, Component 3 also incorporates substantial activity in the dorsal and ventral striatum, regions implicated in reward-based decision making processes. The association of less activity within this component with more impulsive choices supports the contention that impulsive choice behavior is related to diminished influence of executive control mechanisms, which override the tangible value of immediate rewards to enable the choice of less tangible but larger delayed rewards. The lateral frontal, anterior cingulate and parietal regions of the Component 3 network (Fig. 3) correspond closely with a previously described working memory network. Notably, working memory training has been shown to decrease DD rates suggesting possible shared neural substrates for intertemporal choice and working memory processes. Cognitive control may enable prospective processes to \u201cfind\u201d and value delayed rewards. The recent demonstration that a network of lateral prefrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, and parietal brain regions convert subjective value information from value-encoding regions into actual choices is consistent with this idea.

This set of brain regions has been implicated in such processes as memory, emotion, visceral responses, and reward motivation. The association between greater activity within this network and greater DD suggests that reliance on affective processes in decision-making biases choices towards the immediate reward. In other words, activation of this component may reflect a decision-making strategy in which visceral responses to reward choices guide behavior, consistent with Component 9\u2019s incorporation of posterior insula and amygdala activations. The role of the medial temporal lobe regions in intertemporal choice has alternatively been proposed as supporting episodic prospection.

These relationships suggests that these networks may operate competitively in influencing choice behavior. The relative activation of these anticorrelated networks may not determine choice behavior per se, but rather indicate individual differences in neural strategies engaged to make intertemporal reward decisions. The functional relevance of the anticorrelated nature of these systems was further highlighted by the negative relationship between gPPI estimates and a measure of alcohol-related harm (i.e. negative consequences of drinking).

Drug-dependent individuals also demonstrate altered striatal responses to reward, further implicating the network represented by Component 3 in addiction-related processes. In addition, drug craving elicited by stress or drug cues is associated with increased activity in limbic and paralimbic regions included in Component 9. Moreover, impulsive behavior associated with drug addiction has been attributed to impairment in executive control over impulsive processes related to motivation for immediate rewards, suggesting that interactions between executive and motivational systems may be particularly disrupted in addictive disorders. Furthermore, DD processes are more directly implicated in drug use behavior by data demonstrating that heightened DD among addicts is associated with poorer treatment outcomes.
