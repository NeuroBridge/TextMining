The present study was intended to evaluate the effects of a rehabilitative training, the Cognitive Pragmatic Treatment (CPT), aimed at improving communicative-pragmatic abilities and the related cognitive components, on the cerebral modifications of a single case patient diagnosed with schizophrenia. Methods. The patient underwent two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, before and after the treatment. In order to assess brain changes, we calculated the Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF) index of the resting-state fMRI signal, which is interpreted as reflecting the intensity of the spontaneous regional activity of the brain. Behavioural measures of the patient's communicative performance were also gathered before and after training and at follow-up. Results. The patient improved his communicative performance in almost all tests. Posttraining stronger ALFF signal emerged in the superior, inferior, and medial frontal gyri, as well as the superior temporal gyri. Conclusions. Even if based on a single case study, these preliminary results show functional changes at the cerebral level that seem to support the patient's behavioural improvements.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1288, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Communicative-pragmatic refers to the ability to use language and nonverbal expressive means, such as gestures and facial expressions, and to convey meaning in a given context. Despite their almost intact syntactic ability, patients with schizophrenia show difficulties in a more complex use of language, that is, pragmatic. They show poor performance in comprehending different kinds of pragmatic phenomena, such as indirect speech acts, deceit, irony, and metaphoric expression, and in recognizing and recovering communicative failures. Moreover, schizophrenia implies deficits in the management of conversation, narrative impairments, and poor performance in nonverbal expressiveness and in emotional prosody (see). A broad assessment provided using the Assessment Battery for Communication (ABaCo) has recently given an articulated description of communicative-pragmatic deficit in patients with schizophrenia. Results of the study showed that patients have difficulties in using linguistic, extralinguistic, and paralinguistic expressive modalities both in the comprehension and in the production of various types of pragmatic tasks, as direct and indirect speech acts, irony and deceit. According to some authors (e.g.,) these deficits are related to the well-demonstrated theory of mind (ToM) impairment of these patients (e.g.,). However, there is evidence in the literature to suggest that ToM is not able, alone, to fully explain the communicative deficits of these patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2872, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Pragmatic ability is something which is articulated and requires a broad interplay of processes that seem to involve several prefrontal, frontal, and temporal networks, even though the identification of specific neural substrates underlying this competence is quite complicated. Shibata et al. investigated the neural substrates of irony comprehension, showing higher activation in the right medial prefrontal cortex and right precentral and left superior temporal sulcus. More recently, Akimoto et al. highlighted the complexity of the neural correlates involved in the comprehension of irony. The authors identified the right anterior superior temporal gyrus as being associated with the representation of social conceptual knowledge, while the medial prefrontal cortex and the right anterior inferior temporal gyrus could be involved in the understanding of context. Uchiyama et al., in an fMRI study, investigated the ability to distinguish between literal and intended meaning in understanding metaphor and sarcasm. The authors found metaphor-specific activation in the head of the caudate and sarcasm-specific activation in the left amygdala. Furthermore, both metaphor and sarcasm activated the anterior rostral medial frontal cortex. The authors concluded that these areas are jointly involved in monitoring the coherence of literal meaning of the utterance and in mentalizing within social contexts in order to understand the pragmatic-communicative meanings of an utterance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4357, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Data in the literature show that cognitive and communicative impairments may restrict the possibilities for functional recovery and can persist also after the psychosis subsides (e.g.,); moreover, individuals with schizophrenia seem to be able to improve their cognitive and social cognitive abilities following behavioural training.

To measure brain changes in response to practice, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proven to be an excellent tool. It has been used to explore the cerebral mechanisms underlying specific training programs, with both healthy and clinical individuals in several domains. In as much as what concerns schizophrenic individuals, a recent review summarized the studies which evidenced brain plasticity through neuroimaging. More specifically, what kind of changes could be expected in these patients after training of their communicative abilities? In recent years, alterations in neural oscillations have been identified as a potential mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, able to explain cognitive dysfunctions and certain symptoms of this illness (for a review, see). In particular, alterations in the Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF) have been found in adult patients with schizophrenia, in adolescents with early onset, and, to a lesser extent, in adolescents and young people at high clinical psychotic risk. Besides, these alterations covary with cognitive deficits, suggesting that the ALFF relates to symptoms and can predict an onset of schizophrenia. In a rehabilitation perspective, changes of the ALFF index can then give an indication of the cerebral mechanisms accompanying recovery. On the basis of these, we tested the effectiveness of the CPT on a single chronic patient with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. In particular we assessed the ALFF index before and after the CPT: the aim was to investigate the existing relationship between the behavioural improvements due to the training and the cerebral changes in functional activity. We hypothesized a posttreatment reorganization of regions involved in communication: this would indicate that CPT can favor brain plasticity towards improvement. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies assessing the effectiveness of a specific training for the communicative-pragmatic abilities in patients with schizophrenia, using a functional brain activity measure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7991, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.

The subject's slice-based functional scans were coregistered to their 3D high-resolution structural scan, and the 3D structural data set was transformed into Talairach space.

Analogous results have been found by Rapp et al., Eviatar and Just, and Shibata et al. who showed the involvement of the left inferior frontal cortex (BA 45,47) and of the left medial frontal cortex (BA 10) in processing metaphoric sentences. suggested that the particular activation of these areas might reflect semantic-inferencing processes and that dysfunctions at this level might explain deficits in metaphor comprehension in clinical populations such as patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, the superior frontal gyrus is partially responsible for the control of executive functions and has been demonstrated to show abnormalities in schizophrenic individuals. Moreover, Wang et al. found the involvement of the medial frontal areas (BA 10) in the processing of ironic statements, suggesting that this recruitment could be related to the integration of the meaning conveyed by facial expressions and tone of the voice with the comprehension of the speaker's intention. Regarding discourse organization, found activation in middle and superior frontal regions of the right hemisphere in discourse processing and highlighted that the medial frontal regions have a role in the coherence processes in language comprehension and in establishing pragmatic connection between presented sentences. The medial frontal cortex has been found, also, to be involved in pragmatic comprehension tasks related to plausibility judgment and reasoning. Moreover, it seems to have a role in the evaluation of the emotional significance of the external stimuli and in mentalization processes, which are often impaired in schizophrenia and which have been trained during the rehabilitative sessions.
