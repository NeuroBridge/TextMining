However, this could suggest that multivariate measures provide a more powerful way to interrogate circuit pathology. Finally, a general limitation of resting-state studies is the lack of control over transient mental states experienced during data collection. Although we did not debrief participants after scanning, psychotic symptoms experienced in the scanner tend to correlate highly with pre-scanning severity scores. Thus, our findings related to psychosis severity may partly reflect psychopathological states experienced in the scanner.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24459, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24471, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Unmedicated patients with schizophrenia display abnormalities in the functional topography of striatal connections.
