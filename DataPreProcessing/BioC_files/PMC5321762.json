Cross-sectional research, however, cannot clarify whether diminished neural responses to gain anticipation precede or result from substance abuse. Some relevant evidence, however, comes from longitudinal studies of animals. For instance, one study implied that reduced dopamine D2 receptor availability in the striatum (assessed with positron emission tomography or PET) foreshadowed increased drug intake in primates. Another study of rodents bred for impulsivity also indicated that reduced D2/D3 receptor availability in the striatum preceded increased drug intake. This animal research highlights a critical role for longitudinal designs in clarifying causal pathways to substance abuse in humans. Consistent with animal results, the current findings demonstrate in a longitudinal sample of novelty-seeking adolescents that reduced activation of the VS and the midbrain at age 14 precedes PDU at age 16, thus implying that reduced recruitment of the mesolimbic circuit not only results from, but also can precede and predict PDU.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16102, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Theorists have linked reduced activity in the mesolimbic circuit to blunted motivation for reward.

Instead, in combination with previously noted cross-sectional observations of reduced mesolimbic activity associated with addictive behaviour, the present longitudinal findings raise the possibility of a vicious cycle in which novelty-seeking individuals with less responsive mesolimbic circuits seek increased exposure to drugs of abuse, which can further blunt mesolimbic responsiveness, and so maintain addiction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17116, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In neuroimaging tasks that elicit reward anticipation (for example, the Monetary Incentive Delay Task), researchers have reported that subjects show increased ventral striatal activity during the anticipation of large gains in comparison with small gains, no gains and even comparable losses. As in a previous cross-sectional study of adolescent smokers, at-risk adolescents showed reduced ventral striatal activity during gain anticipation, but not in response to gain outcomes. Electrophysiological recordings in primates suggest that the firing of midbrain dopaminergic neurons increases proportional to anticipated gain magnitude, but that firing in response to gain outcomes instead reflects the inverse likelihood of previously anticipated gain (that is, the surprisingness of the gain outcome). More recently, optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research on rats indicated that phasic optogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons increases fMRI activity in the striatum. Thus, the present findings are consistent with an account in which ventral striatal activity during reward anticipation reflects phasic increases in dopamine firing and consequent release in the VS. More support for this account comes from a human study that combined the MID task with fMRI as well as [11C]raclopride PET to demonstrate that individuals who showed more fMRI activity during gain anticipation also showed more PET evidence of dopamine release to gain cues in the VS. Correspondence across imaging modalities was not evident, however, in striatal responses to gain outcomes. In the present study, midbrain activity correlated robustly with ventral striatal activity during reward anticipation, and blunting of this anticipatory response predicted subsequent PDU at age 16 (Supplementary Table 1).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18935, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although neuroimaging tasks less reliably elicit dorsolateral PFC activity than ventral striatal activity during reward anticipation, dlPFC regions also showed reduced activity during reward anticipation in novelty-seeking adolescents who went on to develop PDU. Theorists have posited that impulsive adolescent choice may stem from imbalances in the activity of rapidly developing mesolimbic motivational circuits versus more slowly maturing prefrontal control circuits. dlPFC activity has specifically been associated with planning, behavioural control and goal implementation. More extensive longitudinal assessments might clarify whether reduced prefrontal functional activity reflects a developmental delay or a lasting deficit in adolescents at risk for PDU. Since ventral striatal regions connect to the prefrontal cortex through thalamic relays, which then reciprocally modulate the striatum, additional research might also clarify whether reduced ventral striatal activity precedes reduced prefrontal activity or the opposite. Since PDUrs showed higher (rather than lower) grey matter density in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions, the observed decreases in functional activity could not be attributed to decreased structural grey matter integrity (for example, as in the case of partial voluming). Observed increases in dorsolateral prefrontal grey matter density are consistent, however, with the notion of a structural developmental delay in prospective problematic drug users at age 14, since developmental studies suggest that PFC thickness continually decreases over adolescence, possibly as a result of synaptic pruning. Therefore, relatively greater prefrontal grey matter density might reflect maturational delays in novelty-seeking adolescents that presage PDU.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20720, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Psychometric and behavioural measures have historically offered powerful tools for assessing individual differences in consideration of future rewards and long-term goals. For instance, measures of temporal discounting index a preference for smaller sooner rewards over larger later rewards. Low temporal discounting powerfully predicts future educational and economic success, whereas high temporal discounting has instead been associated with addictive behaviour. Consistent with this cross-sectional evidence, the present longitudinal findings indicate that high temporal discounting at age 14 was associated with PDU at age 16 in high novelty-seeking adolescents. Measures of conscientiousness index the tendency to follow socially prescribed norms for impulse control, whereas low conscientiousness has been associated with a wide range of addictive behaviours (including tobacco, alcohol and drug use). The present findings additionally indicate that low conscientiousness at age 14 was associated with PDU at age 16 in high novelty-seeking adolescents. While both high temporal discounting and low conscientiousness have been linked to compromised PFC function, direct model comparisons indicated that reduced ventral striatal and dorsolateral PFC activity during reward anticipation might uniquely contribute to predictions of PDU in novelty-seeking adolescents\u2014above and beyond contributions from these relevant psychometric measures.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22164, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite strengths of the study design in combining validated neuroimaging probes with substantial matched longitudinal samples, the design also has some limitations. For instance, cutoff criteria for PDU necessarily depend upon specific substances under consideration. In contrast to alcohol and cigarette consumption, in which a score compatible with daily use represented the cutoff, the threshold for other illicit drugs was instead defined based on lifetime use. For this longitudinal sample, low thresholds were adopted (particularly for illicit drugs such as crack, cocaine and narcotics), relative to other studies of early use. Only a few adolescents qualified for PDU at age 16 with respect to use of illicit drugs (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6), whereas most instead qualified based on the use of licit drugs (for example, alcohol, cigarette or cannabis). The validity of the adopted criteria was supported, however, by the fact that the criteria predicted future PDU. Specifically, the percentage of adolescents qualifying for PDU at age 16 was highest for the top quarter of novelty seekers (25.4% PDU), lower for the middle two quarters of novelty seekers (18.5% PDU) and lowest for the bottom quarter of novelty seekers (7.1% PDU). Based on previous research, we adopted a binary threshold criterion for PDU instead of a continuous outcome measure. This classification skirted correlational assumptions that the total amount of substance use maps linearly onto vulnerability. Such a correlational design might assume, for instance, that an individual who uses cigarettes, cannabis and alcohol should show a threefold difference in brain activity in predicted neural targets (for example, the VS) relative to an individual who uses only cannabis. These linear assumptions stand in contrast to the notion that substance abuse may reflect the expression of an addictive syndrome. Consistent with such a categorical distinction, only in the high novelty-seeking group did blunted ventral striatal activity clearly foreshadow later PDU (Supplementary Fig. 2). Further, while stressors and related negative arousal may also potentiate impulsive behaviours including substance abuse in adolescents, the neuroimaging task employed in this study elicited gain but not loss anticipation, and so was primarily optimized to probe neural responses during anticipation of reward. Future research using neuroimaging probes that elicit anticipation of punishment might better probe links between negative arousal and adolescent vulnerability to substance abuse.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24722, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, these longitudinal findings in novelty-seeking adolescents demonstrate that diminished mesolimbic reward motivation along with impaired prefrontal control may confer risk for future PDU.
