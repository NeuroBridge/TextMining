Asking others to rate the personality of their acquaintances often provides even better predictive power than using self-report. Here, we examine whether peer-reported personality can provide a better link between brain function, namely threat-related amygdala activity, and future health-related behavior, namely problem drinking, than self-reported personality. Using data from a sample of 377 young adult university students who were rated on five personality traits by peers, we find that higher threat-related amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions is associated with higher peer-reported, but not self-reported, conscientiousness. Moreover, higher peer-reported, but not self-reported, conscientiousness predicts lower future problem drinking more than one year later, an effect specific to men. Remarkably, relatively higher amygdala activity has an indirect effect on future drinking behavior in men, linked by peer-reported conscientiousness to lower future problem drinking. Our results provide initial evidence that the perceived conscientiousness of an individual by their peers uniquely reflects variability in a core neural mechanism supporting threat responsiveness. These novel patterns further suggest that incorporating peer-reported measures of personality into individual differences research can reveal novel predictive pathways of risk and protection for problem behaviors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1721, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

For example, found that friend-reported personality traits were generally a better predictor of mortality than self-reported personality traits. Specifically, when controlling for self-reported personality traits, lower friend-reported conscientiousness and openness predicted higher mortality risk in men while lower friend-reported agreeableness and emotional stability predicted higher mortality in women. Informant reports more broadly have been shown to be useful predictors across a range of other outcomes, including academic achievement, physical health in adulthood, job performance, clinical severity of psychopathology, and the future emergence of depressive symptoms, often predicting additional variance in these outcomes above and beyond self-report. While the nature of such predictive associations is unclear, it has been hypothesized that informant reports may overcome certain biases present in self-report data, and that when multiple informant reports are obtained, averaging across informants increases the reliability of measurements. In this way, it is possible that peer-reports of trait-like personality may also better reflect biological features of an individual than self-report.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3059, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the context of behavioral neuroscience, we often consider associations between individual measures of brain function and self-reported personality or behavior.

We further planned to test whether these associations were useful for predicting clinically-relevant behavioral outcomes by testing whether peer-reported personality traits predicted future problem drinking above and beyond self-reported personality traits. We focused our analyses on threat-related amygdala activity because this neural phenotype has been extensively examined in relation to self-reported behaviorally- and clinically-relevant outcomes in this and other samples. In particular, in the present sample, we have found that higher threat-related amygdala activity moderates the experience of stress-related problem drinking associated with reward-related brain function. Furthermore, peer reports of personality specifically were chosen for our analyses because our sample of young adult full-time university students spends a relatively large proportion of time socializing with friends, and thus peers may have more opportunities to observe their behaviors across multiple contexts than other potential informants such as instructors or parents.

In the present study, we found that university students exhibiting relatively higher amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions were rated by their peers as being relatively lower in extraversion but higher in conscientiousness. Critically, the unique association between peer-reported conscientiousness and amygdala function was independent of self-reported conscientiousness. The association between amygdala activity and peer-reported conscientiousness is further noteworthy because peer-reported but not self-reported conscientiousness was a significant predictor of future problem drinking in men. This unique mapping of peer- but not self-reported conscientiousness to behaviorally- and clinically-relevant brain function and, in men, to future health-related outcomes could reflect that, in comparison with self-report, peer-report of conscientiousness may be less subject to social desirability bias.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29456, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Notably, we observed different associations between peer-reported personality and amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions compared to amygdala activity to angry facial expressions. Specifically, higher amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions, but not angry facial expressions, predicted lower extraversion and higher conscientiousness. It has been suggested that fearful facial expressions with directed eye gaze, as used in our work, represent a more ambiguous threat, as the source of the threat is not evident from the expression. Therefore, examining amygdala activity separately for ambiguous (i.e., fearful facial expression with directed eye gaze) relative to overt (i.e., angry facial expression with directed eye gaze) threat may result in different associations with personality assessed by both self- and peer-report. Moreover, compared to angry facial expressions, fearful facial expressions have different effects on skin conductance response, the startle reflex, attention, and memory. For example, fearful faces increase detection of changes in peripheral stimuli, and memory is enhanced for neutral words presented after fearful, but not angry, faces, potentially because the source of threat is ambiguous when viewing fearful faces, necessitating greater attention to the surrounding context to determine the source of threat. These differences in the physiological and cognitive consequences of processing fearful compared to angry facial expressions could all contribute to the pattern of results observed here. In addition to replicating the emotion-specific behavioral association observed in the present study, determining the cognitive mechanisms underlying this association is an important direction for future research.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31217, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although higher risk for mood and anxiety disorders associated with heightened threat-related amygdala activity is well-documented in prior research, the present results highlight a potential positive outcome associated with heightened amygdala activity. Namely, relatively higher fear-related amygdala activity may confer an advantage in certain contexts by making individuals more careful or cautious of potential danger in their environment. The observed association between relatively higher amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions and higher peer-reported conscientiousness is novel and requires replication in independent samples before firm conclusions may be drawn. One potential explanation for this association is that enhanced processing of potential threat in the environment, as indexed by fearful facial expressions, may increase sensitivity to the negative consequences of risky actions, in which case individuals with higher amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions may be more careful and responsible in order to avoid negative consequences or disappointing others.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32315, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Moreover, these results align with the finding that individuals in the DNS with higher threat-related amygdala activity were relatively protected from developing problem drinking behavior associated with relatively high reward-related activity of the ventral striatum. In prior research with participants in the DNS, individuals with higher reward-related activity of the ventral striatum, which is associated with higher impulsivity, were found to exhibit higher stress-related problem drinking behavior. Thus, one route to problem drinking appears to involve higher impulsivity and sensation-seeking behavior. However, this effect was not observed in individuals with higher threat-related amygdala activity, suggesting that enhanced processing of threat-related stimuli, including fearful facial expressions, may buffer risk associated with greater reward-related processing. The present results may help explain why this buffering effect is observed; namely, higher amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions is associated with higher conscientiousness, which may facilitate resistance to impulsive risky decision-making related to drinking behavior. In sum, greater sensitivity to potential threat in the shared environment, as indexed by higher amygdala activity specifically to fearful facial expressions, may be associated with higher conscientiousness in order to avoid the perceived negative consequences associated with risky or careless behavior. This, in turn, may predict lower likelihood of developing problematic drinking behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33868, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It is interesting to note the areas of convergence and divergence in which peer raters agreed or disagreed with each other, with self-report, and correlations with amygdala activity. Agreement between different peer raters, between peer-report and self-report, and the overlap in the association between peer-report, self-report, and brain function, was highest for the measure of extraversion. Because items assessing extraversion generally rely on readily observable behaviors (e.g., \u201ctalks a lot\u201d), this may explain why we see the most convergence between different raters and brain function for this aspect of personality. Counter to expectations, we did not observe an association between amygdala function and peer-reported neuroticism. This may reflect the fact that many items assessing neuroticism require an assessment of mental state (e.g., \u201cgets nervous easily\u201d) that may be more difficult for peers to observe. This may be even more difficult in our relatively high-functioning participants, who likely possess effective behavioral strategies for regulating negative mood particularly in the presence of peers. Our results also conform with those of prior research, which finds higher levels of informant agreement on personality traits that are easier to observe, such as extraversion, and lower levels of agreement on personality traits that require insight into mental states, such as neuroticism and openness. Overall, this suggests that peer-reports may be particularly useful when examining the neural correlates of aspects of personality that are observable and that may be subject to social desirability bias when assessed through self-report.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35533, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Discrepancies in brain and behavior associations of the peer- and self-report measures of personality can also be compared to the discrepancies in predictive utility noted when comparing self- and clinician-rated symptoms in individuals with psychiatric disorders. For instance, prior studies have noted that agreement between self- and clinician-rated depression severity is modest at the baseline of clinical trials and that lower agreement predicts decreased likelihood of remission after undergoing treatment. Indeed, it is interesting to speculate that in the present study, individuals with the lowest levels of conscientiousness may be the least likely to report (or be aware of) their carelessness, which could have contributed to the finding that peer-reported personality was a better predictor of future changes in problem drinking relative to self-reported personality. Overall, then, in studies of the neural correlates of personality or psychopathology, a combination of self-, peer-, and clinician-rated measures could each provide complementary yet unique insights into behavior and future clinical outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36658, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These results should be interpreted with respect to several limitations. First, we did not collect additional data on the informants themselves, and so we were unable to examine potential moderating factors such as whether nominated peers were attending the same university as the participants, or the personality or problem drinking behavior of the informants. Second, inter-rater agreement was poor for neuroticism and openness, which also exhibited the weakest correlations between peer- and self-report. As discussed above, this may be related to the difficulty in assessing mental states from observation. Third, we used two different instruments with different psychometric properties, including the wording and number of items, to assess self- and peer-reported personality. This may have contributed to lower correlations between peer- and self-report for some personality traits and differences in the predictive associations between peer- and self-report. Future research using identical measures for peer- and self-report will be necessary to address these possibilities. Fourth, because these analyses required that a participant nominate a peer informant who actually completed the online questionnaire, the present sample likely excludes DNS participants who may be socially isolated individuals lacking close friends to either nominate or who are willing to complete the questionnaire. Likewise, participants who completed the follow-up questionnaire to assess future problem drinking were generally more conscientious and had lower problem-drinking behavior at baseline. Given this pattern of attrition and the overall high-functioning nature of our university student sample, it is likely that the effects reported here are an underestimate of what would be observed in an at-risk sample with less attrition. Fifth, our analyses are limited to associations at one developmental period with a relatively brief informant assessment of personality. It remains to be determined whether the associations observed here exist at other stages of the life span or would be observed with different measures of personality. Sixth, the effect sizes observed were small, with amygdala activity generally explaining an additional 1% of variance in peer-reported personality. These effect sizes are consistent with prior brain-behavior associations observed in this sample using similar analytic methods. These small effect sizes for a single neuroimaging measure point to the difficulty in explaining variation in a complex human behavior such as conscientiousness, and suggest that identifying a broader network with which the amygdala interacts to process threat, as well as networks associated with other processes such as self-control, will likely be necessary to explain clinically-relevant levels of variance. Finally, although amygdala activity to fearful facial expressions was associated with peer-reported conscientiousness in both men and women, peer-reported conscientiousness predicted future problem drinking in men only. While the nature of this sex difference remains to be determined, we speculate that it may reflect differences in drinking motives between male and female university students. For example, low conscientiousness is associated with drinking to enhance positive emotions, and men tend to exhibit higher enhancement motives than women in university samples.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40051, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These limitations notwithstanding, our results provide initial evidence that peer reports can reveal unique associations between brain function and personality left undetected using self-report measures.
