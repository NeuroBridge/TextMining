To measure aggregate genetic risks, the polygenic risk score (PGRS) was computed. Two independent general populations (N\u00a0=\u00a0360 and N\u00a0=\u00a0323) were separately examined to investigate whether the cross-disorder PGRS and PGRS for a specific disorder were associated with individual variability in functional connectivity. Consistent altered functional connectivity was found with the bilateral insula: for the left supplementary motor area and the left superior temporal gyrus with the cross-disorder PGRS, for the left insula and right middle and superior temporal lobe associated with the PGRS for autism, for the bilateral midbrain, posterior cingulate, cuneus, and precuneus associated with the PGRS for BD, and for the left angular gyrus and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associated with the PGRS for schizophrenia.

Resting-state fMRI is a powerful method for evaluating regional interactions in clinical populations. Aberrant functional connectivity is associated with psychiatric disorders and many brain networks, including the salience, central executive control, and default mode network, have been found to be affected. For example, the salience network is associated with all of these disorders, the central executive network is associated with schizophrenia and the default mode network is associated with BD and schizophrenia. Functional connectivity and the brain network have been widely used as promising endophenotypes to establish the link between specific genetic variants and psychiatric disorders. However, few studies investigated the relationship between polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders and functional connectivity. A previous study detected effects of polygenic risk on brain activation for specific ones of these five disorders. However, altered functional connectivity patterns associated with the cross-disorder PGRS and disorder-specific functional connectivity patterns associated with the PGRS for these five disorders remain unrevealed. To address this issue, we studied the functional connectivity alterations associated with cross-disorder PGRSs and disorder-specific altered functional connectivity patterns associated with the PGRSs for these five disorders using young healthy subjects in two independent datasets. First, we calculated the cross-disorder PGRSs and PGRSs for these five psychiatric disorders separately in the 2 independent populations using summary statistics from the PGC GWAS Cross Disorder group as training data. Then, we generated a functional connectivity profile for each subject. Next, we performed a voxel-wise statistical analysis to examine the relationships between the PGRSs and the functional connectivities separately in the two independent datasets.

First, although we applied the same data processing procedures, differences existed in the raw data because they were acquired using different scanners from different sites. This may help explain why we did not find consistent specific functional patterns associated with the PGRS for ADHD and MDD. Next, we have conducted quality control, but there may be still some noise in the data. The different results across P-thresholds may reflect some noise in the data and the results should be viewed with caution until they are independently replicated. Additionally, more samples would increase the statistical power of our study. In our study, the voxel-wise statistical results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the \u201cAlphaSim\u201d implemented in REST, based on the Monte Carlo simulation in AFNI. The AlphaSim algorithm implemented in REST is widely used to correct multiple comparisons in previous studies. Since the subjects in our research were all healthy individuals, their differences may not have been significant enough to survive a more stringent correction. Although we chose a relatively liberal multiple correction method and threshold, our results are robust because we validated them using an independent dataset by conducting conjunction analysis. Conjunction analysis, which can reduce type I error, is a powerful tool to identify typical and generic aspects of the functional architecture of the human brain among contrasts and is widely used to provide evidence of replication. Conjunction analysis is a useful method in our exploratory study. Moreover, the PGRS model does not consider the interactions between SNPs; it is an aggregative model. Interactions between the SNPs should be considered in future studies.
