First, the patients in our study were all receiving second generation antipsychotic medication. The effects of long-term medication use on response to targets within this task have not been systematically studied, either in humans or animal models. However, a recent longitudinal study of first-episode schizophrenia patients using a visual oddball task paradigm during EEG found no association with medication (chlorpromazine equivalent scores) at either baseline or one year follow-up, indicating those results were not confounded by effects of antipsychotic medication. Furthermore, a recent prospective longitudinal study of individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis found that cognitive functioning was unrelated to medication status at an eight month follow-up, whether or not an individual converted to psychosis during that time period. In the current study of individuals with chronic schizophrenia, chlorpromazine equivalents were not significantly associated with performance or estimates of functional connectivity, suggesting that our findings are at least partially independent of medication status. Second, we used a visual, rather than the more common auditory, oddball task. EEG and fMRI studies have generally used the auditory modality, which some suggest may have more extensive abnormalities in schizophrenia ( but see also). The generalizability of our findings to other modalities and types of visual target detection tasks requires further investigation. Third, our study included targets and non-targets only, whereas some studies include novel non-targets to serve as distractors (e.g.,). It would be informative to understand whether our findings of disrupted connectivity to targets extend to non-target, but nevertheless salient, distractors as well. Finally, we found that patients had significantly greater movement parameter estimates compared to controls. We sought to minimize these effects by excluding blocks corrupted by large motion (>0.5mm mean relative displacement) and taking steps during pre-processing to model the effects of motion out of the data.
