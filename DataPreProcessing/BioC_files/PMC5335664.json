Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to process the data. Compared with the FBC, the patients showed lower VMHC in the precuneus, fusiform gyrus/cerebellum lobule VI, and lingual gyrus/cerebellum lobule VI. The patients exhibited lower VMHC in the precuneus relative to the HC. ROC analysis exhibited that the VMHC values in these brain regions might not be ideal biomarkers to distinguish the patients from the FBC/HC.

Current understanding of schizophrenia is that this disease may be the result of interactions between several genes with minimal effects and environmental factors. The traditional case-control design in schizophrenia is a powerful tool to detect group differences between the patients and the controls. However, the traditional case-control design may be confounded by environmental factors even though the controls are from the same large geographic area as the patients. Group differences revealed by the traditional case-control design may have been biased by unmatched effects of environmental factors. In the present study, the traditional case-control design reveals that only the precuneus shows decreased VMHC in the patients relative to the HC. By contrast, the family-based case-control design reveals that the patients have decreased VMHC in the fusiform gyrus/cerebellum lobule VI and lingual gyrus/cerebellum lobule VI in addition to the precuneus compared with the FBC. Therefore, the family-based case-control design minimizes bias due to unmatched cases and controls because the patient-FBC pairs are well matched on many genetic and ethnic confounders. This condition enhances the specificity of detecting possible biomarkers for schizophrenia. However, the efficiency of the family-based case-control design is obtained at the cost of potential overmatching on environmental risk factors. This issue is partly supported by the positive correlations between abnormal VMHC values within the deficit clusters (especially the fusiform gyrus/cerebellum lobule VI) in the patients and the FBC. The shared genetic and overmatched environmental factors may contribute to the positive correlations between abnormal VMHC values within the deficit clusters in the patients and the FBC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15078, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Using the family-based case-control design, we replicated part of our previous findings (i.e., reduced VMHC in the precuneus, fusiform gyrus/cerebellum lobule VI, and lingual gyrus/cerebellum lobule VI).

The fusiform gyrus participates in face and body recognition. The lingual gyrus is associated with processing vision, especially associated with letters. The cerebellum is involved in motor coordination, precision, and accurate timing. Our findings are consistent with a previous study that reported reduced VMHC in the cerebellum and posterior low level sensory processing areas in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Replicated findings suggest that reduced VMHC in the four regions is special to patients with schizophrenia because the family-based case-control design is applied in the present study to reduce the confounding effect of environmental factors.

First, the present findings revealed by the family-based case-control design may be trait alterations independent of symptom severity. VMHC in the precentral gyrus and superior temporal gyrus that showed correlations with PANSS scores in the previous study does not exhibit group differences in the present study. The absence of VMHC findings in the two regions may have caused the lack of correlations between VMHC and PANSS scores in the present study. Second, predominantly positive and negative symptoms in the present patients may complicate the correlations between VMHC and clinical symptoms.

This condition suggests that abnormal VMHC in certain brain regions shared by the patients and the FBC is subtle. Thus, the effects of the shared abnormalities between the patients and the FBC exert minimal influence on the final results. Second, the group differences in years of education show a trend level of significance. The patients received fewer years of education than the controls. Although this variable was applied as a covariate in the analysis, the effect of unmatched education level may not be eliminated completely in this study. Third, the brain cortex is asymmetrical, and the usage of a symmetrical standard template in the analysis may have biased the present findings. Fourth, the inhomogeneous B0 field usually induced distortion in brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Thus, the present findings should be explained with caution. Future studies should be designed to correct such distortion.
