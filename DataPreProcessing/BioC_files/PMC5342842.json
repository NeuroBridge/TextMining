We hypothesized that deficits in cognitive control contribute to these comprehension deficits during discourse processing, and investigated the underlying cognitive-neural mechanisms using EEG (alpha power) and ERPs (N400). N400 amplitudes to globally supported or unsupported target words near the end of stories were used to index sensitivity to previous context. ERPs showed reduced sensitivity to context in patients versus controls. EEG alpha-band activity was used to index attentional engagement while participants listened to the stories. We found that context effects varied with attentional engagement in both groups, as well as with negative symptom severity in patients. Both groups demonstrated trial-to-trial fluctuations in alpha. Relatively high alpha power was associated with compromised discourse processing in participants with schizophrenia when it occurred during any early portion of the story. In contrast, discourse processing was only compromised in controls only when alpha was relatively high for longer segments of the stories.

Indeed, increases in alpha accompany increases in memory load during such tasks. In other tasks, however, such as language comprehension, shifts of attention away from the auditory or visual input are not likely to promote optimal task performance, since information relevant to comprehension may be missed. In this case, increases in alpha may indicate shifts in attention away from the task that may be detrimental to task performance.

The stories introduced an inanimate object in the first sentence as an animate character. Its animacy was established by using language that is normally reserved for animate agents (e.g. references to the character having a big smile on his face).

Our interpretation of this pattern of results depends on our assumption that alpha activity correlates with the focus of attention, specifically the degree to which attention is directed toward an external stimulus. As discussed in the introduction, this is a reasonable assumption given prior research linking shifts in attention away from external stimuli to increases in alpha activity. Based on this assumption, we suggest that the context processing deficits observed in the schizophrenia group may be secondary to deficits in attention to the stories. Participants in both groups had changes in alpha activity across trials that we suggest correspond to changes in attention to the external stimulus (i.e. both groups have trials with relatively low alpha activity and trials with relatively high alpha activity). However, these trial-by-trial fluctuations in alpha activity had the most pronounced influence on context effects in the schizophrenia group. In other words, full attention to the first two sentences of the stories was necessary for participants with schizophrenia to show context effects at the critical target words in Sentence 4. In contrast, control participants showed context effects even when they did not fully attend to a portion of the stories.

These results highlight how attentional control failures in schizophrenia may contribute to impairments in language comprehension tasks in which attention over time is required to construct accurate, high-quality discourse representations.
