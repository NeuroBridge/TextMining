Reactivity to smoking cues predicts smoking cessation success, while greater insula-dACC coupling at rest predicts enhanced smoking cue-reactivity. That smokers with stroke lesions limited to the insula spontaneously quit smoking because their bodies \u2018forgot they were smokers\u2019, suggests that the insula (and presumably its regional interconnectivity) process the body sensations and/or perceptions of nicotine withdrawal. Thus, the current finding of reduced insula connectivity strength between the VS and dACC (key SN hubs) in the slow metabolizers mechanistically support both the reported reduction in cue responding in this CYP2A6 genotype and helps explain the epidemiological and experimental observations of enhanced cessation success in slow metabolizers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25769, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There is growing evidence that the CYP2A6 genotype differentially contributes to smoking cessation treatments. Slow metabolizers respond better to NRT when it is administered for an extended period of time, while the additional treatment time provides no incremental benefit to normal metabolizers, even after controlling for genotype differences in baseline CPD, dependence level, and patch-derived plasma nicotine levels. These observations suggest that the PK of NRT may more closely resemble the smoking-induced nicotine PK in slow metabolizers that originally shaped the neural circuits, replacing downstream nicotine signaling from cigarettes more effectively than among normal metabolizers. In contrast, normal metabolizers respond more favorably to varenicline than NRT, report fewer drug related side effects and greater cognitive improvement. This metabolism group-specific responding is supported in part by the knowledge that varenicline is not a substrate for CYP2A6; thus one might have anticipated identical responses to varenicline among slow and normal metabolizers if not for genotype differences in neurobiological adaptation as reported herein that must have occurred before cessation treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26985, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Taken together, this genetic imaging study demonstrated a strong Gene \u00d7 Environment interaction in cingulate and ventral striatal network hubs supported by circuits that prominently implicate the insula. The ability of these network hubs to process reward signals and stimulus response inhibition are also compromised (although due to the limited sized cohort that performed the MID and Go/NoGo tasks, replication with larger samples is encouraged). Nevertheless, the genetic influence on both task activation and network hubs was seen only in smokers, suggesting that variable brain nicotine levels established during smoking can significantly and differentially modify brain circuits linked to, and perhaps enhance, subsequent nicotine dependence. Our data further suggest that these circuit alterations are a result of, rather than predisposing to, nicotine dependence. This conjecture is further supported by the enhanced BOLD signal seen following acute nicotine administration in nonsmokers. If indeed the identified striatal and cingulate hubs and circuits are altered by chronic nicotine use, they may serve as reversible biomarkers and novel targets for the development of medications to differentially treat nicotine addiction based upon the CYP2A6 genotype.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28254, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28277, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
