Yet, they have considerable overlap in symptomatology and clinical features, particularly in the initial phases of illness. The amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) appear to have critical roles in these disorders; however, abnormalities appear to manifest differently. In our study forty-nine drug-na\u00efve, first-episode MDD, 45 drug-na\u00efve, first-episode SZ, and 50 healthy control (HC) participants from 13 to 30 years old underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Functional connectivity (FC) between the amygdala and PFC was compared among the three groups. Significant differences in FC were observed between the amygdala and ventral PFC (VPFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (dACC) among the three groups. Further analyses demonstrated that MDD showed decreased amygdala-VPFC FC and SZ had reductions in amygdala-dACC FC. Both the diagnostic groups had significantly decreased amygdala-DLPFC FC. These indicate abnormalities in amygdala-PFC FC and further support the importance of the interaction between the amygdala and PFC in adolescents and young adults with these disorders.

As a field, we still rely heavily on longitudinal observation for definitive diagnosis, often resulting in considerable delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. With converging evidence of significant neural abnormalities by the time of illness onset, early identification and intervention is increasingly critical in efforts to substantially alter the trajectory of psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia (SZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD and SZ are severely disabling psychiatric disorders that have long been conceptualized as two distinct illnesses. However, MDD and SZ have considerable overlap in behavioral manifestations and impairments in emotional processing and cognitive functioning, particularly during their initial phases. Frequently, prodromal SZ resembles a major depressive episode and psychotic symptoms are present in first episode MDD, complicating differentiation between the two disorders at initial onset. In first episode psychosis, significant negative symptoms, which traditionally has been viewed as hallmarks of SZ, have been observed in both SZ and MDD, as well as depressive symptoms in first episode SZ. These overlaps in presentation at initial onset challenge effective treatment interventions during the early course of these disorders and ultimately the potential for marked improvement in clinical outcomes. Treatment approaches toward MDD and SZ differ in targets, pharmacologic agents, use of somatic therapy, and duration of treatment, and hence accurate diagnosis is important in determining appropriate treatment for individuals with these disorders. Neural biomarkers could vastly improve differentiation between psychiatric disorders such as MDD and SZ, especially at first onset.
