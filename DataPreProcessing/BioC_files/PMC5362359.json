Assessing both structural and functional brain alterations using multimodal, rather than purely unimodal imaging techniques, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying addiction, which in turn may facilitate future treatment strategies. However, this type of research remains scarce in the literature. We acquired multi-modal MRI from 20 cocaine-addicted individuals and 19 age-matched controls. Compared to controls, cocaine addicts showed a multi-modal hypo-status with 1) decreased brain tissue volume in the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), 2) hypo-perfusion in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, right temporal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and 3) reduced irregularity of resting state activity in the OFC and limbic areas, as well as the cingulate, visual, and parietal cortices. In the cocaine-addicted brain, larger tissue volume in the medial OFC, ACC, and VS, and smaller insular tissue volume were associated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Decreased perfusion in the amygdala and insula were also correlated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Tissue volume, perfusion, as well as brain entropy in the insula and PFC, all showed a trend of negative correlation with drug craving scores. The three modalities showed voxel-wise correlation in various brain regions, and combining them improved patient vs control brain classification accuracy. These results, for the first time, demonstrate a comprehensive cocaine-dependence and craving-related hypo-status regarding the tissue volume, perfusion, and resting brain irregularity in the cocaine-addicted brain.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1830, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1843, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing brain disorder. Identifying abnormal brain patterns that accompany addiction-related symptoms remains a high priority in addiction research. These patterns may help shed light on the neuro-mechanisms underlying addiction/relapse vulnerability or provide sensitive biomarkers for developing addiction interventions or monitoring disease. Using neuroimaging, various brain alterations have been found in the drug addicted brain. In cocaine addiction, reduced grey matter volumes have been demonstrated by many researchers in brain regions that are critical for reward, memory, inhibition, and other functions known to be altered in drug addiction. Those regions include the frontal lobe (prefrontal cortex (PFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), middle cingulate, limbic area (amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia), temporal cortex, premotor cortex, and cerebellum. Since brain tissue subserves brain function, the various structural changes in the drug-dependent brain implicate corresponding functional alterations in the same regions. Indeed, increased brain activation in mesocortico limbic and cortical regions associated with reward and motivation, memory, and learning including ventral striatum, amygdala, ACC, medial PFC, inferior PFC, basal ganglia, etc, have been shown in cocaine patients using both PET imaging and fMRI. However, thus far, the structural and functional alterations have been assessed mainly in separate cohorts of patients or in the same cohorts but in separate reports. Their overlap has not been explicitly examined in the same cohort of subjects (Question No. 1). While functional alterations have been shown in the drug-addicted brain, previous studies only focused on either the baseline (or the tonic) or the dynamic (or the phasic) properties. A more comprehensive functional assessment should consider the two features together. In drug addiction, it is still not clear whether alterations to both features are involved (Question No 2).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3919, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Brain function can be measured with arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. ASL MRI provides a non-invasive way to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF). Due to the coupling of regional CBF to regional brain metabolism, ASL CBF has been widely used as a marker for brain functions. Baseline CBF indicates the tonic brain energy spend, and can be used to assess the tonic property of brain function.

Assessing such functional adaptability may gain a new perspective for understanding brain mechanism underlying brain disorders. Resting BEN alterations have been demonstrated in Schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and multiple sclerosis. Drug addiction has been repeatedly shown to induce changes in brain function.

It should be noted that BEN is different from the inter-regional functional connectivity (FC) that is widely used in rsfMRI studies and has been priorly used in cocaine-addiction studies. BEN measures irregularity of each voxel independently so it can directly characterize regional brain activity, while FC is an indirect measure of local voxels since it needs a reference either from one or several seed regions. Inappropriate seed determinations will inevitably affect the FC analysis results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27448, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, by proving the three hypotheses about the multi-modal brain alterations in cocaine addiction, we have demonstrated for the first time, a comprehensive hypo-status in the cocaine-addicted brain using multi-modal MRI, which were related to drug dependence or craving for drug. We also showed that combing multi-modal imaging data can improve sensitivity for discriminating drug-addicted brain from non-drug dependent brain, suggesting that combing multi-modalities may provide a better approach for predicting disease progression or relapse to drug use. The imaging findings confirmed the sporadic tissue atrophy and functional hypo-status reported in the literature based on different single-modal imaging. The findings highlight the mesocortico limbic area and prefrontal brain in cocaine addiction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28260, "infons": {"section_type":
