In this study, the effects of a 7 mg nicotine patch (vs. placebo) on salience network connectivity were examined in 17 patients with schizophrenia and 19 healthy subjects. We hypothesized abnormal connectivity between the salience network and other major networks (e.g. executive network) in patients under placebo administration and amelioration of this difference after nicotine. We also examined effects of nicotine on betweenness centrality (a measure of the influence of a region on information transfer throughout the brain) and local efficiency (a measure of local information transfer) of the network. A hybrid independent component analysis (ICA) / seed-based connectivity approach was implemented in which the salience network was extracted by ICA and cortical network peaks (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left and right insula) were used as seeds for whole-brain seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis. Significant drug X diagnosis interactions were observed between the ACC seed and superior parietal lobule and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. A significant interaction effect was also observed between the left insula seed and middle cingulate cortex. During placebo conditions, abnormal connectivity predicted negative symptom severity and lower global functioning in patients.

This moment-to-moment evaluation is a major function of the salience network, a functionally and structurally connected set of brain areas that includes the anterior insular and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). The salience network is able to accomplish this task through its functional connectivity to diverse brain areas.

In contrast to these findings, however, other studies have shown either hyperconnectivity between the salience network and executive regions or no significant difference in connectivity. These discrepancies may be attributed to small sample sizes, the location of seed regions, and different subject populations (e.g. unmedicated at-risk populations).

This result suggests that nicotinic agonists may affect topological organization of the salience network in schizophrenia on a global, integrative level (as opposed to a local level). Previous work has demonstrated that the salience network has relatively high betweenness centrality, contributing to its ability to act as an indispensable brain \u201chub\u201d.

As a theorized function of the salience network is to integrate information from other major brain networks and betweenness centrality is a surrogate measure of a region\u2019s capacity for this process, the results of this study suggest that nicotine may topologically reorganize brain function by restoring salience network integrity. The hypothesized role of the salience network in switching between task-positive and task-negative network-dominant states as a function of cognitive demands suggests that nicotine may improve cognition in schizophrenia via its ability to increase the integrative capacity of the network.

Von Economo neurons are unusually long (160\u2013200 microns or more) neurons that are exclusively present in the ACC and insular cortices of large-brained mammals such as elephants, whales, great apes and humans. The unique morphology of these cells is thought to enable these brain areas to communicate with distal sites, facilitating their ability to integrate information from many sources to aid in complex computations associated with high-level cognitive functions, e.g. social behavior. Interestingly, reported a reduction in density of these neurons in the ACC in schizophrenia patients, as well as inverse associations between von Economo neuron density, illness onset, and length of illness.

This subscale measures the degree to which a patient shows relationships with friends and peers (among other factors). Related to this finding, social information processing may depend on the MCC. Research in non-human primates has demonstrated that MCC lesions impair social cognition and reduce contact with others. In humans, the MCC is recruited during tasks that involve monitoring the consequences of actions taken by others and may therefore predict outcomes during social interaction. Consequently, it is reasonable to suggest that the MCC is dysfunctional in diseases that feature social cognitive deficits. In regards to the present study, the finding that hyperconnectivity between the MCC and insula predicted anhedonia/asociality in patients combined with the result that nicotine targeted this functional abnormality suggests that targeting this circuit via nicotinic agents may have therapeutic benefit. Indeed, one behavioral study observed improved social cognition after acute nicotine administration in nonsmoking schizophrenia patients. Another study, however, found no neuronal or behavioral effects of the drug during social cognition in the illness.

It should be noted, however, that 1) nicotine did not have any significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate during scanning in this study, and 2) subjects most likely to have noticeably adverse reactions to nicotine were excluded by prescreening (see Methods). In addition, to help preserve the blind placebo and nicotine patches were covered by clothing, tactilely identical and visually similar, and subjects instructed to refrain from examining the patches. Although it was somewhat surprising to not observe significant physiological effects of the drug, previous work has found only small physiological effects of 7 mg transdermal nicotine (vs. placebo) in nonsmokers up to 120 minutes post-treatment. The latent period (resting state scans acquired approximately 120 minutes post-patch application) was chosen as it was expected to capture the peak plasma absorption of nicotine. It remains possible, however, that later time points may show more profound physiological as well as neuronal effects, and it should be acknowledged that lack of a physiological drug effect can be considered a potential limitation of the study. A second limitation is that nicotine levels were not measured as part of this study. Nicotine absorption and metabolism may vary between individuals, potentially making effects more heterogeneous. It is also possible that the placebo itself may have had affects on connectivity (relative to a treatment-free state), or that intrinsic connectivity may have affected placebo response. Other potential limitations include the relatively small sample size and somewhat arbitrary choice of cost thresholds (from 0.1 to 0.5).

Related to this point, as is typical of studies that examine schizophrenia patients the observed effects may have been confounded by use of antipsychotics. Reduced connectivity between the ACC and insula, for example, has been previously observed during a salience attribution task in untreated (first-episode) patients relative to (atypical antipsychotic) medicated patients.

Betweenness centrality is defined as the proportion of shortest paths of a network that contain a given node. Nodes with low betweenness centrality are colored in gray, nodes with medium betweenness centrality colored in green, and the node with the highest betweenness centrality colored in red. Node 3 (the red node) participates in the highest number of shortest paths between each pair of all other nodes in the network and therefore has the highest betweenness centrality. In the present framework, nodes represent brain regions and edges represent connections between regions. Bottom: Graphical illustration of local efficiency. Local efficiency is a measure of ability of a node and its neighbors to transfer information between themselves. The graph on the left has low local efficiency of the green node and its neighbors. The graph on the right has high local efficiency of the green node and its neighbors due to increased connections between the neighbors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 53165, "infons": {"file": "nihms851739f2.jpg", "id": "F2", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Top: Mean salience network component extracted by independent components analysis.
