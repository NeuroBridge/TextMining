However, most previous studies were based on task fMRI with abstracted and repeated stimuli, while only a handful of studies employed natural stimuli fMRI (N-fMRI) such as video watching. Compared to task fMRI, N-fMRI is more complex, dynamic and closer to human brain's daily perception, which provides multiple cognitive loads in an uncontrolled environment and thus alternative, new opportunities to better understand the brain's functional activities. One of the underlying difficulties of N-fMRI analysis is that it's hard to build correspondence between the input naturalistic stimuli and any specific brain function. Thus it is challenging to use popular model-driven methods like general linear model (GLM) to analyze N-fMRI data. Although there are already a few studies applying GLM on N-fMRI data, prior manual rating processes are typically required for each feature of video stimuli, which is a complex, time-consuming procedure and might lead into inter-rater difference and/or artefacts. Meanwhile, data-driven methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) has been another school of widely used methodologies in exploring functional brain networks in N-fMRI, which aims to decompose fMRI signals into meaningful components and does not need any priori hypothesis of possible incentives of brain responses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2880, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, there are growing numbers of research studies that decompose fMRI data into linear combinations of multiple components via sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals. The basic idea of this framework is to extract whole-brain fMRI signals of one subject and aggregate them together into a big data matrix, which is then decomposed into an over-complete dictionary matrix and a weight coefficient matrix by effective dictionary learning and sparse coding algorithms. In this framework, each dictionary atom stands for the representative signal pattern and functional activities of a brain network and its associated weight coefficient vector stands for the spatial distribution of this dictionary atom. One interesting characteristic of this framework is that the decomposed weight coefficient matrix naturally indicates the spatial overlap/interaction pattern among reconstructed brain networks. This novel data-driven method naturally considers that a brain region might be involved in multiple functional processes/domains, and therefore, each fMRI signal is factorized into several network atoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3997, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "However, one notable challenge of previous studies of sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals is how to establish the correspondence of different dictionary atoms across individual subjects. It would be difficult to assess group differences of functional brain activities in different brain conditions such as CD, PG and healthy controls in this paper without established group-wise correspondence of such dictionary atoms. Responding to this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel computational framework of group-wise sparse coding and representation of the N-fMRI data of multiple groups of subjects (healthy control, CD, PG in this work) and assess the group differences of functional brain networks. Comparing with previous work that applied group-wise sparse representation approach to task fMRI data, we employed and expanded this effective framework to N-fMRI data with more complex and dynamic stimuli from multiple individuals, which is the major technical novelty of our study. Although N-fMRI involves dynamic multimodal stimuli with rich contexts, it has been reported that different individuals tend to respond in similar way under complex naturalistic stimuli. In addition, the multiple cognitive loads in naturalistic stimuli provide us the opportunities to have better understanding of brain activation patterns in different brain conditions. Therefore, by applying our effective group-wise sparse representation method to N-fMRI can not only identify the functional brain networks of interest, but also can uncover group-wise differences in brain activation patterns among different conditions. More specifically, our computational framework aims to learn a common time series dictionary matrix from the aggregated fMRI signals of all three groups of subjects, and subsequently assess weight coefficient matrices corresponding to each common dictionary atom for each group separately. With comparisons of the inter-group differences based on the correspondence established by common dictionaries, our experimental results demonstrated that the group-wise sparse coding strategy can effectively reveal different brain responses of CD, PG and healthy controls under different naturalistic stimuli in a collection of brain networks/regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6269, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.

Relative to HC, CD and PG patients show weaker response to \u201cnatural reward\u201d, that is, sad story. This may be caused by lower dopamine response of CD and PG patients (cite). In addition, CD patients show greater response to cocaine cue in some brain regions relative to PG and HC subjects, while PG patients show greater response to gambling cue in some brain regions compared with CD and HC groups. Our approach can identify brain regions involved in urge of cocaine for CD patients and urge of gambling for PG patients, including insula, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex. Specifically, insula cortex is directly involved in cocaine craving and gambling urges. Similarly, anterior cingulate cortex has been shown to activate during cocaine craving and gambling urges. Also, studies show that decreased activation can be detected in anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex when cocaine users engaged in GO-NOGO response inhibition task with working memory demands, while both dorsal and ventral regions of mPFC/ACC exhibit relatively more activation during craving in men with CD compared to PG. In addition, studies have observed that PG male subjects shows increased activation to video and picture gambling cues in posterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral PFC.

For instance, the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in rational functions, such as empathy and emotion. Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is associated with emotion and memory, especially in pain and episodic memory retrieval. The superior temporal gyrus is involved in the perception of emotions in facial stimuli. Also, insular cortex, which has increasingly drawn attention for its role in subjective emotional experience, plays an important role in mapping visceral states that are associated with emotional experience, giving rise to conscious feelings. Notably, since the naturalistic stimuli are more complex and dynamic than the traditional block-based task input, besides several basic functional networks such as visual, auditory and etc, most of the networks detected by our method under each natural stimuli are complex networks with several associated brain regions, which may indicate interactions between primary functional brain regions like visual or auditory cortex and higher functional brain regions like ACC or PCC.

Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37625, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "From a technical perspective, in this paper, we presented a novel group-wise sparse representation and statistical coefficient mapping method to assess group differences in functional brain activations across CD, HC, and PG groups under different naturalistic stimuli. The basic idea of our computational framework is to learn a common time series dictionary matrix from the aggregated N-fMRI signals of all three groups of subjects, and subsequently assess weight coefficient matrices corresponding to each common dictionary atom for each group separately. The methodological advantages of our group-wise sparse representation and statistical coefficient mapping study are summarized as follows. First, compared with widely used model-driven method GLM and data-driven method ICA, our sparse representation framework not only does not need any priori hypothesis of possible causes of brain responses, but also takes the intrinsic sparsity of the whole-brain fMRI signals into consideration. Moreover, the sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals can effectively and robustly identify concurrent functional networks for all of task-evoked fMRI, resting-state fMRI and natural stimulus fMRI data. Second, compared with previous sparse representation of single subject fMRI signals, our method can automatically establish the correspondences across individuals and populations of different dictionary atoms, which benefits the group statistical comparison analysis. However, for single subject sparse representation method, the correspondence for the atoms related to task paradigm was established by time-frequency analysis, otherwise the template matching method was adopted to establish correspondence across individuals for resting-state fMRI, which is constrained by the limited number of brain network templates. Third, when learning coefficient, the sparsity constraint regularizes the regressor selection, consequently the results from group non-zero t-test will be much stricter. As a result, statistical coefficient maps are more reliable in measuring the significance of contribution. Finally, compared with task-based fMRI, naturalistic fMRI paradigms use more complex and dynamic stimuli to examine neural processes under more real-life condition. As far as we know, our study is one of earliest applications of applying group-wise sparse representation method to N-fMRI datasets of brain conditions. However, there are also challenges and weaknesses associated with our studies. Since the naturalistic fMRI signals have complex and abundant stimuli, using group-wise sparse representation method, we can learn and optimize hundreds of interesting brain networks, and consequently identify group differences across different brain conditions under different natural stimuli. However, due to the lack of ground truth in fMRI studies, it is difficult to interpret the neural meaning of all the learned brain networks and group differences across brain conditions. Thus, more frequency, temporal and spatial characterization methods should be developed in the near future for better interpreting our results. Finally, we should also apply this novel framework in other naturalistic fMRI datasets to examine its reproducibility and robustness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40885, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "From a clinical perspective, our experimental results demonstrated that group-wise sparse representation method can detect multiple meaningful brain networks concurrently, and these networks consistently exist across three groups under three types of videos, despite that obvious group differences in functional activations can be revealed with different brain conditions of CD, HC, and PG.
