However, how these two risk factors interact to determine problem drinking and whether men and women differ in these risk processes remain unclear. In 158 social drinkers (86 women) assessed for Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), positive alcohol expectancy, and Barratt impulsivity, we examined sex differences in these risk processes. Further, with structural brain imaging, we examined the neural bases underlying the relationship between these risk factors and problem drinking. The results of general linear modeling showed that alcohol expectancy best predicted problem drinking in women, whereas in men as well as in the combined group alcohol expectancy and impulsivity interacted to best predict problem drinking. Alcohol expectancy was associated with decreased gray matter volume (GMV) of the right posterior insula in women and the interaction of alcohol expectancy and impulsivity was associated with decreased GMV of the left thalamus in women and men combined and in men alone, albeit less significantly. These risk factors mediated the correlation between GMV and problem drinking. Conversely, models where GMV resulted from problem drinking were not supported. These new findings reveal distinct psychological factors that dispose men and women to problem drinking. Although mediation analyses did not determine a causal link, GMV reduction in the insula and thalamus may represent neural phenotype of these risk processes rather than the consequence of alcohol consumption in non-dependent social drinkers. The results add to the alcohol imaging literature which has largely focused on dependent individuals and help elucidate alterations in brain structures that may contribute to the transition from social to habitual drinking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1975, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Highlights", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1986, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Alcohol expectancy (AE) and impulsivity are risk factors for problem drinking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2065, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "AE mediates the correlation between right insula GMV and problem drinking in women.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2149, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "AE and impulsivity interacts to mediate left thalamus GMV and problem drinking in all.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2236, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Models where changes in GMV as a result of problem drinking are not supported.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2315, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2328, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Studies of risk mechanisms for alcohol use disorders may provide insights that would inform the development of more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions.

For instance, positive urgency (tendency to lose control when one feels exhilarated) as assessed by Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation seeking, and Positive urgency or UPPS-P scale was bidirectionally related to higher levels of alcohol use in college students. Adolescents with a family history of alcohol or substance use disorders initiated early alcohol and drug use in part due to increased impulsivity and sensation seeking, as assessed by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and Sensation Seeking Scale for Children. In an alcohol self-administration paradigm, high-responders showed higher measures of impulsivity on a delayed discounting task, compared to low-responders. However, laboratory studies suggested that impulsivity, when assessed in several different ways, does not directly predispose individuals to problem drinking.

On the other hand, evidence accumulates that cerebral gray matter volumes may represent neural markers of psychological traits that dispose individuals to problem drinking. Thus, whether changes in cerebral morphometry reflect primarliy the effects of alcohol or may represent a trait marker of individual vulnerability to problem drinking remains to be investigated.

We used general linear models to evaluate expectancy and impulsivity as predictors of problem drinking. We then conducted voxel-based morphometry analysis to identify the structural brain correlates of these risk variables. Subsequently, we performed mediation analyses to examine the relationship between the risk variables, gray matter volume (GMV) correlates of problem drinking, and AUDIT score. In particular, because alcohol use is known to affect cerebral structures, we aimed to distinguish two specific hypotheses 1) that risk variables cause problem drinking, which in turn leads to changes in GMV, and 2) that GMV, as a neural phenotype of individual vulnerability, causes higher alcohol expectancy and impulsivity which in turn leads to problem drinking.

The AEQ underwent several revisions since its introduction by, and AEQ-3 consisted of 40 items to address both positive (6 subscales) and negative (2 subscales) alcohol expectancy. Each subscale contains 4 to 6 statements that can be endorsed on a six-point scale, from \u201cdisagree strongly (1)\u201d to \u201cagree strongly (6)\u201d. The global positive subscale contains five items and thus ranges from 5 to 30 in total score, with a greater score indicating higher global positive alcohol expectancy. Although the expectancy subcomponents are statistically discernible, the high subscale inter-correlations (ranging from r\u00a0=\u00a00.42 to 0.92, mean\u00a0=\u00a00.78) suggest that the degree of distinctiveness among the subscales is at best modest.

In short, T1 images were first co-registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute or MNI template space (1.5\u00a0mm3 isotropic voxels) using a multiple stage affine transformation, during which the 12 parameters were estimated. Co-registration started with a coarse affine registration using mean square differences, followed by affine registration using mutual information. In this step, coefficients of the basis functions that minimize the residual square difference between individual image and the template were estimated. Tissue probability maps constructed from 452 healthy subjects were used in affine transformation, and affine regularization was performed with ICBM space template \u2013 European brains. Affine preprocessing was performed with default parameter \u2018light\u2019. After affine transformation, a spatial-adaptive non-local means denoising filter with default parameter 0.5 was applied, to account for intensity variations (inhomogeneity) and noise caused by different positions of cranial structures within the MRI coil; and, finally, they were segmented into cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter, using an adaptive maximum a posteriori method with k-means initializations. In segmentation, partial volume estimation was performed with a simplified mixed model of at most two tissue types, and a local adaptive segmentation was executed with default parameter 0.5 to account for GM inhomogeneity prior to the final adaptive maximum a posteriori estimation. Segmented and the initially registered tissue class maps were normalized using DARTEL, a fast diffeomorphic image registration algorithm of SPM. As a high-dimensional non-linear spatial normalization method, DARTEL generates mathematically consistent inverse spatial transformations. We used the standard DARTEL template in MNI space, constructed from 555 healthy subjects of the IXI-database (http://www.brain-development.org/), to drive the DARTEL normalization. Skull-stripping and final clean up (to remove remaining meninges and correct for volume effects in some regions) were performed with default parameters of 0.5\u2032s. Normalized GM maps were modulated to obtain the absolute volume of GM tissue corrected for individual brain sizes. Finally, the GM maps were smoothed by convolving with an isotropic Gaussian kernel. Smoothing helps in compensating for the inexact nature of spatial normalization and reduces the number of statistical comparisons; however, it reduces the accuracy of localization. Most VBM studies used a kernel size of FWHM\u00a0=\u00a012\u00a0mm.

These findings support the hypothesis that alcohol has deleterious effects on global and regional GM above and beyond age, and that regional associations emerge in early adulthood.

Further, the observed associations were evident in participants without a history of alcohol use and predicted heightened alcohol use in an independent cohort, suggesting that cerebral structural variability is potentially associated with risk for alcohol misuse in healthy populations. In another study reduced cortical thickness in the left superior frontal gyrus, in association with trait impulsivity, preceded substance use in adolescents. Frontal cortical thinning and blunted white matter development predicted initiation of alcohol use at two years of follow-up in adolescents who had no experience with alcohol at baseline.

In particular, changes in thalamic GMVs have been noted in various clinical conditions that implicate impulsivity. For instance, GMVs of brain regions including the thalamus mediated the effects of early life adversities on antisocial behavior. Thalamic volume was significantly smaller in marijuana users compared to non-users and associated with greater non-planning and overall impulsivity. In patients with psychotic disorders suicidal behavior was associated with reduced GMV in cortical and subcortical structures including the left thalamus. In magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, marijuana users exhibited significantly reduced myo-Inositol levels in the left thalamus, relative to non-using participants, in association with elevated cognitive impulsivity as assessed by BIS-11.

One is to note that despite a large number of studies reporting reduction in thalamic GMV in alcohol dependence, other work, including a meta-analysis of close to 296 cases and 359 controls, failed to reveal these changes. It is possible that thalamic volume reduction occurs only in a subpopulations of alcohol dependent individuals but does not reflect a universal outcome in association with chronic alcohol use. These individual differences may be central to our understanding of the cerebral manifestations of problem drinking. In support, a longitudinal study showed that smaller volume of bilateral thalamus at treatment entry is related to relapse to heavy alcohol consumption; the cerebellum, striatum, and cingulate gyrus but not the thalamus recovered in GMV during abstinence. Further, compared to controls, at-risk adolescents with a positive family history of alcohol abuse demonstrated significantly smaller volumes of the thalamus and other cortical and subcortical structures in association with externalizing symptoms scores. In animal work, VBM showed that reduced GMV in the thalamus, ventral tegmental area, insular and cingulate cortex in alcohol-na\u00efve Marchigian-Sardinian (msP) alcohol-preferring rats, as compared to control rats, establishing a cerebral structural risk factor for excessive alcohol consumption.

A direct test of slope difference in the linear regression of AUDIT against BIS score confirmed the sex difference. On the other hand, positive alcohol expectancy is associated with problem drinking in both men and women. Affirming these associations, general linear models showed that alcohol expectancy and the interaction of alcohol expectancy and impulsivity best predicted problem drinking in women and men, respectively. These findings are consistent with sex differences in the role of behavioral impulsivity as a risk factor in binge drinking and use of caffeinated alcoholic beverages in college students. Notably, in contrast, some studies of dependent individuals showed that women tend to have higher impulsivity compared to men. It is plausible that, compared to men, women are more susceptible to the effects of chronic alcohol consumption and exhibited impaired frontal functioning and greater impulsivity after prolonged alcohol use.
