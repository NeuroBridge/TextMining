These two previous studies evaluated the first and the last viewing periods, and investigated between-group differences in neural activities during viewing of videos of gambling, happy, or sad content, or with gambling, sad, and cocaine content.

In that study, PG subjects displayed relatively decreased activity in frontal and OFC, caudate/basal ganglia, and thalamus compared with controls. In our recent study, a diagnostic group by video interaction identified mPFC, which was activated mainly to cocaine videos in CD participants during the initial viewing period, and a more dorsal mPFC region that was most strongly activated for cocaine videos in CD participants, gambling videos in PG participants, and sad videos in HC during the last viewing period. Our current study includes both men and women of EA-only PG versus HC, and investigates signal changes during the entire period of tape-viewing (a different analytic approach used in). We have reanalyzed the current study data separated by sex using the previous approaches, partially replicating our previous findings in an independent sample with relatively decreased activities in VS (p\u2009=\u2009.033) of PG versus HC for the male-only sample, but not for the vmPFC (see Supplementary Material X).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34277, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Strengths, limitations and future directions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34322, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Together, the findings suggest important roles for dopamine and norepinephrine in emotion regulation and impulse control and provide a context for the novel DBH-related findings reported here. Strengths of this initial study lie in the whole-brain analytic approach to assess neural activity and sizable samples of CC and T-carrier subjects. While some effects between cue conditions may linger, the counterbalancing approach was designed to mitigate this possibility. Responses to sad-scenario content (parental divorce, a relative\u2019s death) may differ based on individual subjects\u2019 experiences; information regarding parental divorce or death was not collected and limited us from evaluation of its impact on the responses to sad cues. Nonetheless, the qualitative and emotional intensity ratings by participants provide support that the scenarios were successful in generating the intended emotional responses. Additionally, findings in this study substantiate previous reports of diminished empathy in T-carriers and extend these findings to demonstrate the neural substrates underlying this effect.
