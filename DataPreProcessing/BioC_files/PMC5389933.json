A number of existing studies tested for relationships between white matter microstructural abnormalities and physical characteristics of FASD such as dysmorphic facial features. The studies that examined correlations between DTI measures and facial dysmorphology reported no significant relationships, suggesting that these measures may be somewhat independent of each other (i.e. white matter microstructure can be impacted by PAE even when dysmorphic features are not present). White matter integrity has been shown to be associated with cognitive functioning in FASD in a number of domains: executive functioning, inter-hemispheric transfer / finger localization, processing speed, intelligence, working memory, and math skill.

In addition, the current study defined \u201catypical\u201d connectivity in a specific direction (High CPL, high MCC, high LOC, and low GLOB all represent a degree of bias in the network toward dense local connectivity prioritized above more efficient long-distance connectivity). Future analyses of the CIFASD dataset, employing more participants, may be able to examine alternative cutoffs. It is also important to note that younger participants were more likely to have been excluded from the study because of in-scanner motion compared to older participants. This finding suggests that future studies may benefit from oversampling younger children or employing additional motion restriction techniques during data collection. Also, it is worth considering that the group distinction employed in this study (PAE vs. control) is not perfectly precise (we often have imperfect information about amounts of prenatal alcohol exposure, etc.) and, therefore, this imprecision may also have contributed to the lack of an overall main effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on network connectivity measures.
