A recent family genome-wide association study (GWAS) by the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) found that theta EROs during visual target detection were associated at genome-wide levels with several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including a synonymous SNP, rs702859, in the KCNJ6 gene that encodes GIRK2, a G-protein inward rectifying potassium channel that regulates excitability of neuronal networks. The present study examined the effect of the KCNJ6 SNP (rs702859), previously associated with theta ERO to targets in a visual oddball task, on theta EROs during reward processing in a monetary gambling task. The participants were 1,601 adolescent and young adult offspring within the age-range of 17\u201325 years (800 males and 801 females) from high-dense alcoholism families as well as control families of the COGA prospective study. Theta ERO power (3.5\u20137.5 Hz, 200\u2013500 ms post-stimulus) was compared across genotype groups. ERO theta power at central and parietal regions increased as a function of the minor allele (A) dose in the genotype (AA > AG > GG) in both loss and gain conditions. These findings indicate that variations in the KCNJ6 SNP influence magnitude of theta oscillations at posterior loci during the evaluation of loss and gain, reflecting a genetic influence on neuronal circuits involved in reward-processing. Increased theta power as a function of minor allele dose suggests more efficient cognitive processing in those carrying the minor allele of the KCNJ6 SNPs. Future studies are needed to determine the implications of these genetic effects on posterior theta EROs as possible \u201cprotective\u201d factors, or as indices of delays in brain maturation (i.e., lack of frontalization).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1959, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Studies using implanted depth electrodes in rats have reported that neural oscillations were modulated by anticipation and delivery of reward.

The overall goal of the present study is to investigate the genotypic effects of a KCNJ6 SNP (rs702859) on theta EROs during reward processing in subjects (17\u201325 years old) in the COGA Prospective study. This age range was selected as the study by indicated that the effects of this SNP on theta EROs were strongest in this age range of the prospective study. The rationale for selecting rs702859 was three-fold: (i) this SNP had a genome-wide significant association with theta ERO in the previous GWAS study; (ii) this SNP was in high LD with the top genome-wide significant genotyped SNPs, and (iii) this was the only exonic genomewide significant SNP in the KCNJ6 gene. Given that there is empirical evidence showing relationships between (i) KCNJ6 and the reward system, (ii) theta EROs and the reward system, and (iii) KCNJ6 and brain oscillations, the primary hypothesis of the study is that variations in rs702859 genotypes will influence theta ERO power during loss and gain processing.

Although the age range in the current study is not \u2018ideal\u2019 to examine these developmental changes in brain oscillations, when the topographic maps of late adolescents (17\u201318 years) and young adults (19\u201325 years were compared (see Fig. A2 in Appendix), it was found that overall, the adolescent group showed more theta power and more diffuse posterior topography than the adult group, regardless of genotype. Furthermore, the subgroups with minor allele(s) (AG and GG) showed a more diffuse topography with less frontalization than those with the AA genotype, perhaps suggesting a delay in brain maturation. Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies of brain development indicate a reduction and focusing of activity, with a shift toward more frontal activity as pruning occurs in the brain (i.e., frontalization). Specifically, ERO theta power gradually decreases as children mature, becoming less in early adolescents, and even less in young adults, as efficiency of cognitive functioning improves with increased phase locking of the theta system and hence neural communication in the course of development. Therefore, given these suggested findings in the current study, it is possible that the minor alleles of KCNJ6 could be associated with lack of frontalization and/or delayed brain maturation. It is also important to mention that the genotype \u00d7 condition interaction was not significant, indicating that the main effect of genotype may be non-specific and pertain to the feedback evaluation process in general, rather than to loss or gain specifically. Since theta-band responses can be elicited by a variety of task-relevant stimuli, the effect observed could be non-specific. On the other hand, significant condition \u00d7 region effect suggested outcome-specific theta activity, in which gain manifested posteriorly focused (parietal) theta power while the loss condition showed relatively anterior (fronto-central) focus. With regard to visual oddball paradigm, reported that theta power related to target processing was frontally focused, and the genome wide association was strongest for the frontal region, followed by central and parietal regions. Further studies are needed to ascertain the effects of task-specific theta activity on the genotypes of KCNJ6 polymorphisms.

GIRK channels allow potassium ions to flow into the cell rather than out of the cell, a property referred to as \u201cinward rectification\u201d. GIRK channels have been shown to be critical for excitatory synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory, as GIRK2 null mutation or GIRK channel blockade has been found to abolish depotentiation of long-term potentiation in cultured hippocampal neurons. GIRK2 is also associated with opioid transmission in the brain and analgesic properties. Further, GIRK2 is widely expressed in cerebellum, and an elevated expression of these channels may be involved in neuropathology, and contribute to a range of mental and functional disabilities in Down syndrome. Alterations in GIRK channel function have been associated with pathophysiology of severe neurological disorders (cf.), such as epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease and ataxia and Down\u2019s syndrome. GIRK channels are implicated in motor activity, anxiety, reward and movement disorder (ataxia). Recent studies have suggested possible role of KCNJ6/GIRK2 in bipolar disorder and depression. Further, there is also evidence to show that GIRK2/KCNJ6 function directly influences neuroelectric activity (EEG). For example, there are animal studies showing relationship between KCNJ6 and neuroelectric/seizure activity of the brain. A knockout mouse model found that animals deprived of functional KCNJ6 protein were susceptible to spontaneous and provoked seizures (cf.). A recent study with a mouse model of seizure activity reported that GIRK2 channel (KCNJ6) may play a major role in the genesis of childhood epilepsy (infantile spasms) as measured by the changes in EEG activity and behavior. Importantly, animal studies have reported that GIRK2 channels influence reward network by promoting adaptations in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and thus could influence reward-related behaviors and actions including alcohol and drug addiction. Taken together, these findings suggest that GIRK2 (or the KCNJ6 gene) may play a vital role in modulating neurocognitive function/dysfunction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29703, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.3.

KCNJ6/GIRK2 has also been found to be involved in addictions to several drugs, such as opioid/opiate, nicotine, morphine, and cocaine. It is proposed that the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins in the reward pathway might underlie adaptation to alcohol and other addictive drugs. Neurochemical mechanisms underlying ethanol activation of GIRK channels have also been extensively studied (for reviews, see). It has been shown that mice lacking GIRK2 channels consumed more ethanol and failed to develop conditioned place preference for ethanol when compared to their controls, suggesting that GIRK2 may be mediating the reinforcing and/or aversive motivational aspects of ethanol action. In a GWAS in the COGA sample with a neurophysiological phenotype (ERO theta power to targets in an oddball task) we have reported genome wide significant associations of KCNJ6 SNPs; however, the association of these SNPs with alcoholism (or other addictions phenotypes) in COGA were not examined. On the other hand, using a candidate gene approach, reported a significant association of a KCNJ6 polymorphism (rs2836016) with alcohol dependence, hazardous drinking and early life stress, and suggested that individuals consumed more alcohol to experience its rewarding effects possibly mediated by the role of GIRK2 in dopaminergic signaling. However, this SNP is located in a different region of the KCNJ6 gene compared to the SNP explored in the current study. Since GIRK2/3 channels are exclusively expressed in VTA dopaminergic neurons, these channel properties may have important implications for addiction in general and AUD in particular.

Recent genetic studies and the current study have demonstrated associations of KCNJ6 with theta EROs. The current study has indicated that variations in the KCNJ6 SNP (rs702859) influence magnitude of theta ERO power at posterior leads during during the evaluation of loss and gain, reflecting a genetic influence on neuronal circuits involved in reward processing. Higher theta power as a function of minor allele dose suggests more efficient cognitive processing in those carrying the minor allele of the KCNJ6 SNPs, as increased theta activity during cognitive tasks is indicative of efficient processing. On the other hand, lack of frontalization in theta EROs observed in those carrying minor alleles may be suggestive of delayed brain maturation in these individuals. Future studies are needed to determine the specific effects of KCNJ6 on cognitive (dys)functions.

According to the \u2018CNS disinhibition\u2019 model of alcoholism proposed by, a heritable hyperexcitability of the CNS caused by homeostatic imbalance is involved in a genetic predisposition to develop alcoholism and related externalizing disorders.

A trial with a gain of 50\u00a2 and the next trial with a loss of 10\u00a2 are illustrated. The ISI between the CS and the OS is 1500 ms. Participants were required to respond to the OS within 1000 ms (i.e., response window) by selecting one of the two amounts. ERO analysis was performed on trial epochs of 1000 ms post-stimulus period after the onset of the OS (i.e., analysis window).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49235, "infons": {"file": "nihms838942f2.jpg", "id": "F2", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Sixty-one electrodes were recorded in the current study from the surface of the scalp.
