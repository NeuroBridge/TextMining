Here we aim to explore DFC across a spectrum of symptomatically-related disorders including bipolar disorder with psychosis (BPP), schizoaffective disorder (SAD) and schizophrenia (SZ). We introduce a group information guided independent component analysis (GIG-ICA) procedure to estimate both group-level and subject-specific connectivity states from DFC. Using resting-state fMRI data of 238 healthy controls (HCs), 140 BPP, 132 SAD and 113 SZ patients, we identified measures differentiating groups from the whole-brain DFC and traditional static functional connectivity (SFC), separately. Results show that DFC provided more informative measures than SFC. Diagnosis-related connectivity states were evident using DFC analysis. For the dominant state consistent across groups, we found 22 instances of hypoconnectivity (with decreasing trends from HC to BPP to SAD to SZ) mainly involving post-central, frontal and cerebellar cortices as well as 34 examples of hyperconnectivity (with increasing trends HC through SZ) primarily involving thalamus and temporal cortices. Hypoconnectivities/hyperconnectivities also showed negative/positive correlations, respectively, with clinical symptom scores. Specifically, hypoconnectivities linking postcentral and frontal gyri were significantly negatively correlated with the PANSS positive/negative scores. For frontal connectivities, BPP resembled HC while SAD and SZ were more similar. Three connectivities involving the left cerebellar crus differentiated SZ from other groups and one connection linking frontal and fusiform cortices showed a SAD-unique change.

SZ is a psychotic disorder characterized by persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations) and decreased function. BPP is marked by presence of mania and concomitant psychosis. Over 100 years ago, Kraepelin distinguished between SZ and BPP primarily based on longitudinal course and long-term outcome, but noted that cross-sectional symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, and mood disturbance were found in patients with both diagnoses. Indeed, Kraepelin in 1920 lamented that his two-psychosis model failed to adequately capture distinct disorders. Kasanin introduced SAD, which combines features of both SZ and mood disorders, to elucidate this apparent symptom overlap by postulating an additional diagnostic category. Differentiating BPP, SAD and SZ can be difficult based on phenomenological features alone. Considering the difficulty of differential diagnosis and lack of consensus, biological, in addition to symptomatic, measurements may be useful for differentiating these clinical syndromes. So far, most biological measures also fail to uniquely differentiate the psychoses, suggesting that more work is needed to understand the relationships between these clinical syndromes and neurobiology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3460, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Both structural and functional imaging have been used to explore abnormalities in BPP, SAD and SZ.

Functional connectivities and functional networks derived from resting-state fMRI data also have been used to investigate these disorders. Khadka et al. analyzed data of SZ, BPP and their unaffected first-degree relatives using independent component analysis (ICA), and identified significant alterations in seven functional networks. Our previous work studying networks decoded by ICA found brain differences among BPP, SAD and SZ in multiple networks (including the default mode and salience networks), and observed that HCs and BPP patients clustered into one group while SAD and SZ patients clustered into another group. Using a regions of interest (ROIs)-based method, Argyelan et al. investigated differences among HCs, SZ and BPP patients in whole-brain functional connectivities, and found that SZ patients had significantly lower connectivity strengths than HCs, and BPP group showed intermediate connectivity strengths between SZ group and HC group. While decreased connectivity strength has been found in SZ, some work has also reported increased connectivity strength in SZ. So far, brain function impariments among BPP, SAD and SZ are still unclear. It is uncertain whether there are progressively network alterations from HC to BPP to SAD to SZ, and what kinds of distinct versus shared impairments are related to these disorders.

This technique computes functional connectivities using the windowed BOLD time series, resulting in time-varying connectivity patterns along different windows and thereby revealing implied connectivity states. The diverse connectivity states may yield promising biomarkers for psychosis. To extract connectivity states, researchers have employed various methods including clustering and decomposition techniques. Connectivity states extracted using different methods may have discrepant patterns due to their different assumptions. Furthermore, while connectivity states obtained from clustering approaches have the same scale with real connectivity strength, post-processing may be needed for connectivity states estimated using decomposition methods. Researchers used K-means to extract connectivity states by grouping connectivity patterns from different windows into several clusters. K-means could converge exponentially slow for data with extensive noise and fall into local optimum. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used to decompose the window-direction concatenated connectivity patterns of all subjects into spatially uncorrelated components, of which the principle components are considered to be the group-level (common) primary connectivity states across subjects. Using Fisher discrimination dictionary learning (FDDL), time-varying connectivity patterns were decoded by sparse representation over connectivity states. The supervised machine learning method required prelabeling each connectivity pattern as guidance. Miller et al. applied spatial ICA on the window-direction concatenated connectivity patterns of all subjects to estimate spatial independent components (ICs), which reflected the group-level connectivity states. Temporal ICA also has been used to decompose the dynamic connectivity series of all subjects to compute temporal ICs, and the corresponding mixing coefficients of ICs were regarded as the group-level connectivity states.

In our work, we selected the most stable run from 20 runs of ICA according to an improved method and then regarded the components associated with the most stable ICA run as the reliable ICs (see supplementary materials), which is different from the original ICASSO technique taking the centrotypes of multiple runs as reliable ICs. Note that before the group-level ICA, a two-step PCA (including subject-level PCAs and group-level PCA) was performed for data reduction.

Greater M will preserve more variances from individual-subject dynamic connectivity. In order to simplify state matching and consequent comparisons among different groups, M was determined to be the same number for all groups in our study. It is known that the selection of number of components is always difficult in blind signal decomposition problem, since different rules could result in different numbers. In dynamic connectivity analyses using fMRI data, many previous studies applied spatial ICA, temporal ICA, PCA and K-means to estimate connectivity states with the number of states as 5.

First, the number of ICs was adjustable, and the change of this parameter may influence the estimated states and the identified group differences. To facilitate the comparison among the four groups, we set the number of ICs as an empirical value, five, for all groups. The setting preserving enough variance in individual PCAs led to reliable performance under the conditions of different ICA runs, different ICASSO runs and different subsets of samples for all groups. Furthermore, we also investigated the states\u2019 reliability under different numbers of ICs including 2, 4, 5, 6 and 10. Results (supplementary Fig. S1\u2013Fig. S3) show that the parameter 5 yielded relatively higher reliability than bigger number (i.e., 6 and 10) while preserving acceptable variances compared to smaller number (i.e., 2 and 4). We also found that the group differences in the dominant state identified using different settings showed similarity to some extent (see supplementary Fig. S7), while the p-value maps from settings 5 and 6 were likely closest to each other. Hence, the setting 5 maintained a relatively better balance among the preserved variance, the reliability of states, and the resulting group differences in our study. However, other choices for the number of states, such as different settings for different groups, may deserve further study. In addition, effectiveness of the identified measures for distinguishing individual patients also needs to be evaluated in future work. Second, we mainly investigated the subtle group differences in connectivities based on the dominant state due to the fact that the dominant state was very consistent and comparable across all subjects in all groups. For the non-dominant states matched approximately across groups, different groups exhibited various patterns. Therefore, we primarily compared their similarity and disparity at the group level as well as their fluctuations for those highly-matched states, rather than conducting statistical analyses on the individual-level states. In future, an effective method needs to be developed to investigate differences in the non-dominant individual states. Third, the number of time points of fMRI data used in our study was relatively small. Some work used data including more volumes to investigate dynamics; however, many studies have already shown that different connectivity states can be robustly and replicably captured using similar time points in a short period. Fourth, we regressed out the global signal from each voxel\u2019s time series in preprocessing, since a global signal is assumed to reflect a combination of resting-state fluctuations, physiological noise (e.g. respiratory and cardiac noise), and other noise signals with non-neural origin. Removal of the global mean has been shown to facilitate the detection of localized neuronal signals and improve the specificity of FC analysis, although it could result in increased negative correlations. Some previous work reported that meaningful anti-correlated networks may only become detectable after regressing no-biological origins. Considering that regressing out global mean is a controversial issue, it may deserve further investigation. Finally, we did not study non-psychotic bipolar patients; whether these differ from bipolar individuals with psychotic symptoms needs to be studied separately. In addition, we investigated group differences based on the symptom-based diagnoses that likely need more refinement.
