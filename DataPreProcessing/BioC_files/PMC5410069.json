However, whether the activation of the mesolimbic reward system results in alcohol consumption depends on the ability of higher-order structures to regulate incentive reward processing. Prevailing theories of addiction point to the involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) not only through its engagement in executive functions, essential for goal-directed behavior (e.g. coding action-outcome conjunctions, salience attribution or self-control), but also through its monitoring of the mesolimbic reward system. Past research suggested that aberrant incentive salience to rewards is not solely restricted to alcohol-associated cues, but also to non-dug rewards. These studies showed that alcohol dependent patients show reduced activation of the VS during the anticipation of monetary gain. On the contrary, recent results from our own group provided evidence that alcohol dependence is characterized by an imbalance between increased ventral striatal activation and weakened prefrontal control, as characterized by decreased frontostriatal connectivity during the anticipation of monetary reward.

Preceding the flashlight, an arrow cue informs the participant about the rewarding consequences of their response to the flash stimulus. Four conditions are included in the paradigm: (1) in the so called monetary reward condition (arrow up) participants\u2019 fast response to the flash is rewarded with 2\u20ac; (2) in the punishment avoidance condition (arrow down) a slow response is punished by a loss of 2\u20ac while a fast response is rewarded by the avoidance of that loss; (3) the verbal feedback condition (vertical double arrow) allows the participants to receive verbal feedback on their performance; (4) in the passive control condition (horizontal double arrow) no response is required. During the outcome phase, the participants see the reward of the latest trial (\u201c2\u20ac\u201d, \u201c0\u2033 or \u201cFast response!\u201d, \u201cToo slow\u201d) as well as their cumulative total gain at that point in time. In order to ensure that all participants are able to win some money and have comparable winnings, the threshold for a fast response is adaptively tailored for each trial to the individual response times of the subject. The inter-trial interval was randomly varied between 6 and 9\u00a0s. Each condition is presented 10 times in a pseudo-randomized trial order with no more than two equal conditions in succession.

The planned project is set-up to transfer previous research about the reward circuit and default mode network underlying alcohol dependence and depression to achieve a better understanding of neural signatures characterizing their comorbidity. By means of diverse experimental paradigms allowing a comprehensive characterization of reward and default mode network activity and connectivity, we are planning to assess distinct and common mechanisms underlying comorbid alcohol and depressed patients. In addition, the neurobiological results will be used to test whether a brief psychotherapeutic intervention program is able to positively influence the identified pathomechanisms. By gaining a better understanding of diverse phenotypes and their underlying neurobiological signatures, it might be possible to improve clinical outcomes by offering specific types of psychotherapy. Furthermore, we should find support for our hypotheses that established behavioral and mindfulness based intervention programs specifically alter pathological neurobiological functions. By this, we will be able to identify neurobiological markers of therapy efficiency. The prediction of psychotherapeutic success based on neurobiological signatures will help to guide the selection of specific therapeutic options.

A second challenge affects the recruitment of comorbid depressed and alcohol dependent patients. Not only for the fMRI measurement, but also for the feasibility of the group therapy patients abstinence is a prerequisite. In order to motivate comorbid patients to participate in the group therapy and to stay abstinent, we want to guarantee a fast study enrolment, as well as ensure a short latency between study enrolment and begin of group therapy. For that reason, we decided for a group randomization of 6 participants per block. With this, we might risk recruitment-dependent biases.
