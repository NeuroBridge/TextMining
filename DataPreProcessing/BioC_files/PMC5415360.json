Among the challenges arising in such situation, estimating the link between genetic and neurological variability within a population sample has been a promising direction. A wide variety of statistical models arose from such applications. For example, Lasso regression and its multitask extension are often used to fit a multivariate linear relationship between given phenotype(s) and associated observations. Other approaches, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), are widely used to extract relationships between sets of variables from different modalities. In this paper, we propose an exploratory multivariate method combining these two methods. More Specifically, we rely on a \u2019CCA-type\u2019 formulation in order to regularize the classical multimodal Lasso regression problem. The underlying motivation is to extract discriminative variables that display are also co-expressed across modalities.

Imaging genomics is an emerging field whose aim is precisely to leverage the wealth of biomedical knowledge provided by genomic and brain imaging data. Integrating such multimodal data sets is critical to extract meaningful bio-markers, improve clinical outcome prediction or identify potential associations across modalities. Unfortunately, as mentioned by Lin, such studies using genomic and brain imaging data often run into two limitations: The first one is an average small sample size, which may result in over fitting issues. In order to address such constraint, many authors relied on the use of sparse models. One classical method introduced by Tibshirani is the Lasso regression. The second limitation is poor biomarker reproducibility across studies.

Multimodal analysis (e.g. using both genomic and brain imaging) often improve generalization in situations in which many irrelevant features are present. In their recent paper, Cao et al. proposed a sparse representation based variable selection (SRVS) algorithm relying on sparse regression model to integrate both SNP and fMRI in order to perform biomarker selection for the study of schizophrenia.

Its goal is to extract linear combinations of variables with maximal correlation between two (or more) datasets.

In the present study, we propose to associate both the regression and CCA frameworks in the case of M = 2 datasets. Our motivation is to extract informative features that also display a significant amount of correlation across modalities. A simple way to combine Lasso and sparse CCA would be a weighted combination of Eq.(1) and Eq.(4):  where \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1] is a weight parameter. Notice that Eq.(5) can be expressed within the collaborative framework introduced in Section 2.2. If we take a look at Eq.(3) with M = 2, U1 = X1 and U2 = X2, we fall back on Eq.(5). Let us call this model CoReg for Collaborative Regression. Interestingly, a similar model has been considered before by Gross to perform prediction using breast cancer data. However, to our opinion, such formulation might prove to be too constraining. It essentially amounts to force each component of the \u03b2m\u2019s to fit both the regression term and the CCA one. We illustrate such behaviour using a toy dataset later in Section 3.4. Since our goal is to perform feature selection, we may allow the model to be slightly more flexible. We thus propose an alternative formulation by first duplicating each \u03b2m into two components such that:  where \u03b1m, \u03b8m are vectors from \u211dpm. As a consequence, the \u03b2m\u2019s are now matrices such that \u03b2m \u2208 \u211dpm\u00d72 \u2200m = 1, 2. We then propose the following MT-CoReg formulation:  where  is the i-th row of \u03b2m, i.e. . The third term of Eq.(3.3) is simply the \u21131/\u21132 norm of each of the \u03b2m. As we can observe from looking at Eq.(3.3), each \u2019component\u2019 (i.e. column of \u03b2m) will be involved in separate parts of the functional J: (i) components \u03b1m are the fit to the regression term of Eq.(3.3), (ii) components \u03b8m are the fit of the CCA term of Eq.(3.3). Each pair (\u03b1m, \u03b8m) and m = 1, 2 is coupled through the use of the \u21131/\u21132 norm from the third term in Eq.(3.3). Although their values are different, shared sparsity patterns are encouraged within each pair (\u03b1m, \u03b8m). As a consequence, we allow the method to be significantly more flexible in terms of solutions: different values can be taken to simultaneously fit the Regression and CCA parts. We hope that such framework will encourage the selection of features that are discriminative (via the regression part) but also co-expressed across modalities (via the CCA part). Note that when \u03b3 = 0, criterion (3.3) essentially reduces to the initial regression problem of Eq.(1), while setting \u03b3 = 1 amounts to solving a conventional sparse CCA problem.

The variable selection method is then applied to each of the subsamples along a grid of candidate values for the parameter.

We can first turn our attention to the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) values obtained on the testing set during our tests. Histograms of SSE distributions for different \u03b3 values (i.e. Lasso, MT-CoReg and sCCA) can be seen in Fig.(5, left): unsurprisingly, Lasso and MT-CoReg produce the lowest RSS values, while sCCA does not fit the phenotype. If we now look at Fig.(5, middle) where distributions of Pearson\u2019s correlation on the testing set are displayed for the same 3 strategies, we can see that MT-CoReg produces a better selection than Lasso in terms of cross-correlation. This seems to confirm our intuition that MT-CoReg makes the best of both Lasso and CCA by producing a solution that is good fit to the phenotype while selecting co-expressed features across modalities.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22865, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Distribution of \u03b3 values produced by the consistency selection scheme described in Section 3.3 can be seen in Fig.(5, right).

First, we proposed a novel variable selection approach using a CCA-like regularization term in order to enforce co-expression between modalities. Secondly, we present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, as well as strategies to estimate the tuning parameters. On top of that, a series of experiments on both synthetical and real datasets were conducted, allowing us to evaluate the performances of the proposed method. We identified two sets of SNP and voxels in which a number of them have been previously reported to have potential relationship with the risk of schizophrenia. Further exploration of the optimization scheme (alternate estimations) as well as the selection of regularization parameter \u03bb (see Section 3.3) will be needed in the future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24065, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24127, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24138, "infons": {"fpage": "126", "name_0": "surname:Lin;given-names:D", "name_1": "surname:Zhang;given-names:J", "name_2": "surname:Li;given-names:J", "name_3": "surname:He;given-names:H", "name_4": "surname:Deng;given-names:H-W", "name_5": "surname:Wang;given-names:Y-P", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Multi-omic Data Integration", "type": "ref", "year": "2015"}, "text": "", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24139, "infons": {"fpage": "267", "name_0": "surname:Tibshirani;given-names:R", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
