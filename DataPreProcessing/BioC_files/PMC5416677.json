Although the endogenous opioid system has been implicated in emotion regulation, the effects of mu-opioid receptor blockade on brain systems underlying negative emotional processing are not clear in addiction. Individuals meeting criteria for alcohol dependence alone (n=18, alcohol) and in combination with cocaine and/or opioid dependence (n=21, alcohol/drugs) and healthy individuals without a history of alcohol or drug dependence (n=21) were recruited. Participants were alcohol and drug abstinent before entered into this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate brain response while viewing aversive and neutral images relative to baseline on 50\u2009mg of naltrexone and placebo. We found that naltrexone modulated task-related activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus as a function of childhood adversity (for aversive versus neutral images) in all groups. Furthermore, there was a group-by-treatment-by-condition interaction in the right amygdala, which was mainly driven by a normalization of response for aversive relative to neutral images under naltrexone in the alcohol/drugs group. We conclude that early childhood adversity is one environmental factor that influences pharmacological response to naltrexone. Pharmacotherapy with naltrexone may also have some ameliorative effects on negative emotional processing in combined alcohol and drug dependence, possibly due to alterations in endogenous opioid transmission or the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist actions of naltrexone.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1872, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1885, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Emotions have a critical role in the development, maintenance and successful treatment of addiction. Suppression of negative affective states such as anxiety and withdrawal symptoms is one motivational pathway to support the consumption of alcohol. As negatively reinforced drinking becomes more pronounced, negative affective states increase, thereby escalating alcohol intake and raising vulnerability to relapse after treatment. Negative reinforcement is driven by activation of stress-induced neurocircuitry in what is widely referred to as the \u2018dark side' view of addiction.

Threat-related reactivity of the amygdala, for example, is strongly associated with negatively reinforced problem drinking. Connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus is associated with maladaptive emotional processing, and alterations in hippocampal network activation and connectivity have been shown to predict relapse. The prefrontal cortex has extensive connections with subcortical structures that regulate emotional processing, including the amygdala. Alcohol and drug exposure impairs emotion regulation in this region, with interconnected medial and cingulate networks showing enhanced reactivity to arousing stimuli and reduced capacity to suppress negative affect. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also act to appraise and regulate negative emotions. These cortical areas over-activate in response to substance-related and naturally evocative stimuli and, together with limbic regions associated with impaired emotional processing in addiction, are candidate loci for pharmacological intervention.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3773, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Naltrexone is one pharmacotherapy used in the management of alcohol dependence that works by modulating opioid control of dopaminergic cell firing in the ventral tegmental area, thus preventing an increase in dopaminergic activity. The endogenous opioid system has been implicated in emotion regulation. There is some evidence of naltrexone dampening responses to negative emotional stimuli in healthy adults, although this likely reflects stress-reducing effects of the potent kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist actions of naltrexone. mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism is known to precipitate withdrawal symptoms in humans with current and previous opiate use. MOR antagonism also precipitates aversive consequences of withdrawal from chronic opioid exposure in animals. Naltrexone increases negative emotions in response to stress- and drug-related images in individuals with opioid dependence and increases anxiety in response to drug-related films in individuals with alcohol and cocaine dependence. However, the efficacy of naltrexone treatment has been shown to be associated with greater naltrexone-induced aversion (that is, the more negative the aversive stimulus, the greater the treatment response). This may be due, in part, by activation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis associated with all substances of abuse potential. Specifically, naltrexone-induced adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels are thought to reduce craving in individuals with alcohol dependence. Exposure to psychological trauma, another form of aversion, is also known to contribute to individual treatment responses to naltrexone. This is consistent with preclinical evidence showing that early environmental adversity is associated with better treatment effects of naltrexone, suggesting that adversity experienced in early stages of development upregulates endogenous opioid function.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5674, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Childhood adversity has long been known to be common in substance use disorders, with at least two-thirds of alcohol- or drug-dependent adults reporting a history of physical, sexual or emotional abuse.

We observed greater task-related activation in the right amygdala during the processing of aversive relative to neutral images under placebo in individuals recovering from alcohol dependence.

Similar to our alcohol group, participants from the above studies were characterized by only one drug dependency. The lack of discriminatory response between aversive and neutral images was specific to our alcohol/drugs group, possibly reflecting an emotional desensitization following prior exposure to adverse events, an attentional disengagement to aversive images (although we consider this unlikely as our task does not tap into attentional resources) or altered MOR availability/density associated with abstinence from repeated drug exposure (for example, cocaine; opiates; alcohol) and/or individual differences in environment factors.

These data demonstrate that naltrexone-induced functional alterations during negative emotional processing are specific to groups characterized by distinct patterns of drug dependencies that can persist in prolonged abstinence. Activation of stress-induced neurocircuitry contributes to the \u2018dark side' view of addiction, in which recruitment of brain \u2018anti-reward' systems (for example, within motivational circuits of the extended amygdala), an opponent process to hyperactivation of the brain reward system, provides strong motivation for negatively reinforced drug seeking. Increased activation in response to aversive images could also lend vulnerability to craving and relapse via stress-induced reinstatement of emotion-processing circuitry. However, a relative normalization of response by naltrexone in our alcohol/drugs group is likely due to a kappa-antagonist effect being more potent in individuals with increased dynorphin-dependent KOR activation. The latter is associated with negative emotional states, higher sensitivity to stress and/or more severe psychopathology as a consequence of combined drug taking. Stress-induced activation of the dynorphin/kappa-opioid system has dysphoric-like effects that are thought to mediate negative emotional states. However, KOR blockade has shown consistent anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in both humans and animals, including attenuation of a stress response. Evaluation of the potential therapeutic benefits of selective kappa-opioid antagonism in the treatment of addiction and comorbid stress-related mood disorders thus may form an important area of new research.
