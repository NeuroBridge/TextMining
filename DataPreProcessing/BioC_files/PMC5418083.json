Research indicates that neural connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) is related to social cognition and social functioning in healthy and clinical populations. However, the association between DMN connectivity, social cognition, and social functioning has not been studied in schizophrenia. For the present study, we used resting-state neuroimaging data to evaluate connectivity between the main DMN hubs (i.e., the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex-anterior precuneus (PPC)) in individuals with schizophrenia (n=28) and controls (n=32). We also examined whether DMN connectivity was associated with social functioning via social attainment (measured by the Specific Levels of Functioning Scale) and social competence (measured by the Social Skills Performance Assessment), and if social cognition mediates the association between DMN connectivity and these measures of social functioning. Results revealed that DMN connectivity did not differ between individuals with schizophrenia and controls. However, connectivity between the mPFC and PCC hubs was significantly associated with social competence and social attainment in individuals with schizophrenia but not in controls as reflected by a significant group-by-connectivity interaction. Social cognition did not mediate the association between social functioning and DMN connectivity in individuals with schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that fronto-parietal DMN connectivity in particular may be differentially associated with social functioning in schizophrenia and controls.

To date, research has evaluated several interventions aimed at improving social functioning. However, the effects have been modest, and as such, interventions targeting the social dysfunction associated with schizophrenia could benefit from additional optimization.

This hypothesis suggests that abnormal communication between neural networks is responsible for the cognitive and clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, including social functioning deficits. For instance, several studies observed aberrant connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) among individuals with schizophrenia. Moreover, this aberrant DMN connectivity has been associated with deficits in social cognition (e.g., social perception, mentalizing) among individuals with schizophrenia. Specifically, social perception is the ability to perceive social cues such as facial affect, tone, or gestures, while mentalizing is the ability to ascertain others\u2019 emotions, beliefs, and intentions.

As a data-driven procedure, pICA generates components that represent functionally integrated brain regions as opposed to structurally defined brain regions.
