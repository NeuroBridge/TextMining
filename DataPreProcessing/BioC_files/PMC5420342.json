Resting state functional connectivity has shown great potential in identifying these alterations. However, current studies focus on specific seeds and leave out many brain regions where effects might exist. The present study uses a data driven technique for brain segmentation covering the whole brain. Functional magnetic-resonance-imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 188 subjects: 51 non-substance consumption controls (CTR), 36 smoking-and-drinking subjects (SAD), 28 drinkers (DRN), and 73 smokers (SMK). Data were processed using group independent component analysis to derive resting state networks (RSN). The resting state functional network connectivity (rsFNC) was then calculated through correlation between time courses. One-way ANOVA tests were used to detect rsFNC differences among the four groups. A total of 50 ANOVA tests were significant after multi-comparison correction. Results delineate a general pattern of hypo-connectivity in the substance consumers. Precuneus, postcentral gyrus, insula and visual cortex were the main brain areas with rsFNC reduction suggesting reduced interoceptive awareness in drinkers. In addition, connectivity reduction between postcentral and one RSN covering right fusiform and lingual gyri showed significant association with severity of hazardous drinking. In smokers, connectivity changes agreed with the idea of a shift towards endogenous information processing, represented by the DMN. Hypo-connectivity between thalamus and putamen was observed in smokers. In contrast, the angular gyrus showed hyper-connectivity with the precuneus linked to smoking and significantly correlated with nicotine dependence severity. In spite of the presence of common effects, our results suggest that particular effects of alcohol and nicotine can be separated and identified. Results also suggest that concurrent use of both substances affects brain connectivity in a complex manner, requiring careful consideration of interaction effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2175, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Graphical abstract", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2194, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1 Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2209, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Consumption of alcohol and nicotine results in neurological alterations that may promote continued use of both drugs.

Alcohol studies based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have found altered functional relationships and corresponding compensatory mechanisms among different parts of the brain linked to these deficits. For example, a finger tapping task demonstrated that alcohol dependent patients recruited areas of the parietal lobe, inferior frontal, middle temporal, pre- and post-central gyri to compensate for a dysfunctional fronto-cerebellar network used by normal controls. Connectivity between the cerebellum and the default mode network (DMN) is reduced in alcoholics during resting state, but increased during a spatial working memory task to compensate and achieve same performance than controls. Attenuated insula activation, observed during an emotional processing task, may be linked to reduced interoceptive awareness. Even after long-term alcohol abstinence, it has been found that resting state FC differs compared to controls. Decreased resting state connectivity within reward, visual and executive control brain regions successfully predicts relapse in abstinent alcoholics, further evidence of the importance of examining FC. A decrease of FC in executive control, sensorimotor, visual and subcortical was found in alcoholics when compared to controls. Results from all these studies lead to the proposal of a \u201cdisconnection syndrome\u201d which can be involved in the deficient behavioral control related to alcohol use disorder. Although the authors suggest that some effects could have been influenced by smoking, evidence for the existence of this disconnection pattern involving DMN, salience, subcortical and executive control networks was presented in where a whole brain analysis was performed using seed-based methods.

While cognitive improvement could be linked to increased connectivity effects within executive control and fronto-parietal networks, reduced connectivity has also been found within networks involving the posterior cingulate and precuneus. In the same study, Pariyadath et al. found that both increased and decreased connectivity helps in predicting smoking status using a support-vector-machine classifier.

Thus, it is also important to complement previous work with approaches that are less dependent on a specific seed assumption.

We hypothesize that different patterns of FC exist depending on drinking, smoking or combined drinking and smoking. Based on previous research we expect to see decreased connectivity associated with reward, executive control, default mode and visual brain areas in alcohol users. With respect to nicotine use, both increases and decreases in connectivity effects are anticipated for cingulated cortex, precuneus, and executive function areas. Common neural pathways for drug dependence exist, but alcohol and nicotine have different mechanisms of action. While nicotine seems to be able to directly activate dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, alcohol may indirectly produce a similar effect by inhibiting GABAergic receptors.

Since the insula is an area known to be involved in interoception of bodily functions, insula hypo-connectivity observed in our results is consistent with reduced interoceptive awareness previously linked to alcohol addiction.

In contrast, the DMN connectivity (angular gyrus vs. precuneus) was found to be strongly affected by nicotine as group difference and FTND association both indicated a significant connectivity increment. The RSN pair PCC and postcentral gyrus also show connectivity increment linked to the DMN as smokers exhibited stronger anti-correlation. These results and the fact that smokers were abstinent for at least 3 hours before scanning seem concordant with the hypothesis that nicotine withdrawal might promote an enhancement in DMN functioning and shift network dynamics away from task positive areas in order to maintain homeostasis in a brain suffering from withdrawal effects. In contrast, hypo-connectivity in smokers was found within the reward system including the brain areas of thalamus and putamen. The thalamus is a main hub of information in the brain important in the study of nicotine addiction. It has been found that smoking reduces glutamate (one of the major neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain) in the thalamus, thus affecting its information relay function. Thalamic activity has been previously found to be correlated with FTND scores and has been mentioned in many studies as part of affected brain networks. Both putamen and thalamus have been found to be abnormally active during smoking cues presentation to abstinent smokers. Lack of connectivity between putamen and thalamus can be an indication of reward dysregulation that enhances nicotine-seeking behavior in smokers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30706, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One of the limitations of our data is the unequal behavioral scores collected to measure alcohol use. Subjects in the CTR group were excluded after screening for alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse, but no information regarding number of drinks or AUDIT score was collected. However, several studies indicate that AUDIT and DSM-IV have similar specificity providing evidence that subjects in the CTR group were likely assigned to the correct group. A second limitation of the current study is the lack of inclusion of other measures that could have been useful to distinguish among the four sample groups. For example, prior studies have used machine learning algorithms to distinguish controls from various substance dependent samples using features from neurocognitive, personality, and psychiatric measures, whereas the current study only used neuroimaging features. Because we relied on a convenience sample combined from existing studies, few measures overlapped, thus preventing us from conducting our analyses with behavioral assessments. Future studies that combine neuroimaging and behavioral assessments will be valuable for determining the utility of neuroimaging measures in predicting group membership. Another limitation originates from the strict multiple comparison correction utilized to reduce the number of false positives. Reported findings likely reflect only the strongest effects of drinking or smoking, while other possible effects like the ones observed by hypotheses-driven region-of-interest may be missed. This could explain the relatively small number of ECN effects observed in this work compared to previous studies. In this study, participants were not actively using other drugs (including methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, prescription pain medication, prescription sedatives and stimulants). As has been done here between alcohol and nicotine, future studies should be conducted to evaluate the potential cross effect with other common substances such as marijuana. In spite of the multiple group differences observed, the results show few relationships with AUDIT and FTND, which could be indication of pre-existing brain states unrelated to drug use. It could also indicate that observed differences might be better captured by other covariates not considered in this study. Another possible explanation is the stationary behavior assumed for the time courses in the applied method. Methods that analyze dynamic connectivity, e.g., can identify and separate brain states which may exhibit closer relationship with behavioral measures. Finally, this study was designed as a resting state analysis free of important cognitive measures that can be obtained using different task paradigms. Our observations are then limited to task-free outcomes and leave a cognitive evaluation for future work and experimentation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33556, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "5 Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33569, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our data provide evidence for interoceptive and sensorial dysfunctions as reduced connectivity in insula, precentral and visual areas might be associated to reduced awareness of input signals observed in alcohol. Affected brain areas also span motor (SMA) and cognitive (precuneus) functions suggesting that top-down body control pathways might also be impaired. Nicotine induced a protective effect in drinkers who also smoked for particular brain areas in the default network (PCC) and higher visual processing network (lingual gyrus and fusiform girus), but did not improve the reduced connectivity of the primary visual region. These different effects in visual areas may be useful in separating drinkers and drinkers that smoke. In addition to PCC, nicotine also increased connectivity in the angular gyrus, which is another important part of the DMN. This DMN hyper-connectivity supports the idea of a salience disruption that shifts network dynamic towards the DMN in order to resolve withdrawal effects in the brain. Our observations seem to lack the ECN emphasis previously found by alcohol studies. Only one ECN RSN embracing the left IPL showed significant hypo-connectivity with the left IOG. In our data, reduced ECN-visual connectivity resembles the sensorimotor-visual hypo-connectivity pattern in smoking and drinking subjects. The similar hypo-connectivity effect in ECN and sensorimotor areas may be related to the hypothesis of a network dynamic that shifts away from exogenous information processing. In addition, results support the existence of a putamen-thalamus dysfunction that might be involved in nicotine craving behavior as previously observed in. The different effects observed in our study indicate that alcohol, nicotine and their interaction affect the brain in particular ways that may help understand the specific or interactive mechanisms of substance use on brain function. These results also show that concurrent use of substances must be carefully controlled when studying substance specific effects on the brain.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35622, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35645, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
