We also observed several areas of decreased functional connectivity between the OFC seed and a number of areas, including the precuneus, superior/middle frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, inferior parietal lobule, and cingulate gyrus. We believe that these findings are of high clinical relevance, as they take a substantial step beyond regional activation studies, to support the existence of a cohesive network of neural communication during client language in favor of change. Compellingly, this study offers the first study to actually accrue empirical support for networks that our team had previously hypothesized might be relevant in treatment response in 2011 . More specifically, we proposed that the OFC might co-activate with the IFG, in what we had titled the \u201cexecutive control network\u201d, to clinically facilitate an individual\u2019s movement toward behavior change.

As with change talk, connectivity during sustain talk was also showed a large area of decreased connectivity between the OFC seed and regions including the precuneus, caudate, middle/superior frontal gyrus, thalamus, insula, and SMA. Most simply, these data reflect the substantive OFC network communication during adolescents\u2019 processing of both types of clinical, in-session language. Interestingly, when contrasted directly, we found a parallel level of response across both types of client response; in other words, network connectivity was not greater for one type of client statement relative to the other (CT vs. ST). We posit that, for adolescents, comparable, and similarly powered, neural network systems are activated during language in favor of changing, along with language in favor of staying the same. Notably, these two types of client language that have been associated with very different behavioral response within the adult treatment literature; more specifically, client change talk has been associated with positive treatment response (lower substance use post-treatment), whereas client sustain talk has been associated with much poorer treatment outcomes (greater substance use post-treatment) . We believe that future work must continue to disentangle the nature of neural response during both types of client language in order to understand the strength and pattern of brain response in adolescent addiction treatment, with a particular eye to how network response and post-treatment change may be unique within this developmental period, as compared with other age groups who are more often examined in treatment contexts (e.g., treatment-seeking adults) .", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32917, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In terms of treatment response, OFC connectivity with the anterior cingulate/medial frontal gyrus - during change talk (only) - was significantly correlated with adolescents\u2019 behavior change in this study.

This is interesting, as it maps onto larger scale studies of cannabis use, where greater OFC connectivity, specifically, has been a distinguishing marker of a much greater risk profile, in terms of protracted use and associated problems . Further, these data are also in line with a recent meta-analysis in the field of depression, which supported the impact of psychotherapy on similar neural circuits . Moreover, OFC network systems may not only be responsive to therapy, but potentially modifiable through therapy directly, and/or potentially through an adjunctive venue to enhance brain response to psychotherapy (e.g., neurostimulation) .

Clinically \u2013 this is a very interesting finding, and one that is highly informative in terms of guiding in-session clinician efforts. In other words, even though these types of language (sustain talk and change talk) may be processed in the adolescent brain similarly, they are highly different in terms of clinical predictive validity; only change talk was associated with reductions in substance use .

While interpretation of these findings must be made with caution due to the very small sample size, these data serve as preliminary indication that within the adolescent brain, processes underlying or driving addiction (such as reasons for using) may be more common across substances of abuse, than potential reasons for changing.

One is by evaluating the strength of the role of the OFC network as a predictor of treatment response. Emerging studies with adults and adolescents suggest that brain markers may represent more sensitive and powerful metrics of clinical symptoms and behavior change . A second role for the use of neural metrics is to continue to examine different facets of behavior change . This is still very much at the cutting edge, with an increasing number of studies examining how to integrate neural parameters into clinical trials. However, it is our position that this approach is scientifically savvy; if we can continue to identify which neural mechanisms underlie positive behavior change, we can then take steps to strengthen those treatment elements in our clinical approaches .", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38109, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Limitations and Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38137, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While there are notable strengths to the current study, including the novel use of in-session client language to better understand brain networks during the psychotherapeutic exchange and their relation to behavior change, the following limitations warrant consideration. First, and most importantly, while advances are being made in this direction, it is still not possible to conduct behavioral interventions in the MRI; an in vivo, temporal evaluation of these relationships represents an important next step in understanding these data. Second, the binge drinking sample was a pilot study with a small sample size; we are currently conducting a larger study which will allow us to better parse out auditory and narrative components of the task for added specificity of findings. Replication of the conjunction analysis with this larger sample will help strengthen study findings, and allow for additional exploration into potential age and gender differences in neural networks and treatment response. Third, in line with standard protocols in adolescent addiction treatment studies , there was no healthy control group in this study; this is because the sample needed to have adequate levels of substance abuse in order to be able to potentially detect behavior change in post-treatment substance use patterns. In other words, it would not be possible for participants to show behavior change (e.g., reduction in potential substance use) if they began as a non-user. Fourth, while client change talk was the focus of this investigation, we included the results for the sustain talk condition in the supplemental analyses; compellingly, these data support that the relationship between OFC network response for client language and treatment outcomes was specific to change talk only. No relationship was observed between sustain talk and client treatment outcomes. However, future work will examine in greater depth the relationship between change talk vs. sustain talk, in order to disentangle the relationship between treatment elements, neural network response, and treatment outcomes for adolescents. Fifth, we acknowledge that head movement in the scanner during fMRI data acquisition can cause artifacts. Although task-based fMRI data is less systematically affected by very low amplitude head movements, we utilized several strategies to minimize head movement during data collection (e.g., mock scanner motion training, foam padding) as well as approaches to assess data quality and account for motion during processing and analysis (regressing motion estimates and other nuisance regressors). Further, tests of motion correlates did not indicate greater motion during change talk relative to sustain talk; together, our observed effects in the presence of sub-millimeter motion suggests that these significant findings are robust. Finally, we suggest understanding networks of neural response is useful in that it offers a creative and innovative approach to accelerate discovery of critical neural mechanisms. In other words, it is important to consider that one of the critical contributions of this manuscript is that it sets the foundation for those who want to pursue this type of translational research.
