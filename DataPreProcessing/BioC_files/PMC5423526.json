Abnormalities within the dopamine system may contribute to these disturbances and pharmacologically targeting the D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3) is therefore of significant clinical interest. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the acute effects of the DRD3 antagonist GSK598809 on anticipatory reward processing, using the monetary incentive delay task (MIDT), and response inhibition using the Go/No-Go task (GNGT). A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design approach was used in abstinent alcohol dependent, abstinent poly-drug dependent and healthy control volunteers. For the MIDT, there was evidence of blunted ventral striatal response to reward in the poly-drug-dependent group under placebo. GSK598809 normalized ventral striatal reward response and enhanced response in the DRD3-rich regions of the ventral pallidum and substantia nigra. Exploratory investigations suggested that the effects of GSK598809 were mainly driven by those with primary dependence on alcohol but not on opiates. Taken together, these findings suggest that GSK598809 may remediate reward deficits in substance dependence. For the GNGT, enhanced response in the inferior frontal cortex of the poly-drug group was found. However, there were no effects of GSK598809 on the neural network underlying response inhibition nor were there any behavioral drug effects on response inhibition.

These patterns may be due to upregulation of DRD3s in stimulant and alcohol dependence and evidence of enhanced dopamine autoreceptor actions in response to chronic exposure to alcohol. While requiring replication in a larger sample, exploratory investigations raised the intriguing possibility that GSK598809 may be relatively ineffective in opiate dependence. At the time of writing, we were unable to find any published studies on DRD3 density in human opiate addicts. However, in contrast to the increases in DRD3 expression in rodents after alcohol and cocaine exposure, a very recent study demonstrated that heroin exposure decreased DRD3 expression, possibly explaining the apparent reduced efficacy of GSK598809 in those with a primary opiate dependence.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21287, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to effects within DRD3-rich regions, whole-brain analyses revealed effects within the caudate, cerebellum, and DLPFC.

There is evidence supporting the caudate, lateral prefrontal regions, and cerebellum to be important regions mediating the integration of motivation with goal-directed behavior.

They perhaps reflect recovery of prefrontal structure and function in successful abstinence owing to cessation of drug use and cognitive control practices. Whether this hyperactivation, which is also found in relatives of alcohol patients, is protective for relapse or an addiction vulnerability marker is unknown. However, fMRI hyperactivation during cognitive tasks has been reported in detoxified alcohol-dependent participants who subsequently abstained but not in those who relapsed, supporting the notion that prefrontal hyperactivation may be protective.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23194, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite previous studies suggesting a link between overexpression of DRD3s and increased impulsivity as measured by questionnaire, we found no evidence to suggest GSK598809-modulated performance or neuronal response of the network underlying response inhibition. This may be due to the multifaceted nature of impulsivity, with DRD3s affecting some impulsivity measures but not response inhibition as measured here. We found no association between a questionnaire measure of impulsivity and GNG brain response or performance. Furthermore, while mood-related impulsivity correlates more strongly with D2/D3 binding in the ventral rather than dorsal striatum in pathological gamblers, response inhibition correlates with receptor binding in the dorsal (where DRD3 density is low) but not the VS. These findings suggest that different impulsivity measures have different underlying neuro-circuitry. Prefrontal regions are important for response inhibition, again regions where DRD3s are low. Low DRD3 density in regions implicated in response inhibition may explain the lack of a modulatory effect of GSK598809 in our study. We additionally carried out exploratory investigations within the DRD3-rich regions for the GNGT. However, no effects of GSK598809 modulations were found.

A post hoc exploratory ROI analysis was carried out within the anterior insula, a region considered to process salience and therefore likely to be sensitive to habituation effects. Notably, the anterior insula is reliably implicated in MID performance (in a meta-analysis performed by our group) but is devoid of DRD3s. No effects of GSK598809 or interactions were found within this region, supporting the suggestion that the effects seen were indeed drug effects rather than non-specific habituation effects.
