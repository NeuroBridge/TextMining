Identifying brain-behavior patterns that differentiate heavy drinkers who develop alcohol use disorder from those who do not will provide valuable information about the individual differences associated with this disorder, thereby informing treatment efforts. A common approach used to characterize brain-behavior abnormalities associated with mental health problems like alcohol use disorder is to compare individuals with a particular condition to controls using experimental tasks designed to measure specific neural processes and associated behavioral output within a neuroimaging environment. In this way, challenging brain activity and behavior during task performance can uncover deficiencies and/or compensatory mechanisms. In particular, the cognitive control of behavior and inter-connected processes such as working memory have been a research focus due to their essential roles in normal psychosocial functioning. For example, studies using working memory tasks and neuroimaging techniques have demonstrated working memory deficits are linked to altered brain activity in various mental health disorders including, but not limited to, schizophrenia, pathological dissociation and bipolar disorder.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3184, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Abnormal working memory has also been identified as a critical concern in substance use disorders, having been demonstrated in individuals dependent on alcohol and various other classes of drugs including opioids, cannabis, cocaine and methamphetamine. That working memory deficits are found across problematic users of alcohol and other drugs is perhaps not surprising considering that impaired control over the use of these substances is a characteristic of substance use disorders and this behavioral control relies, in part, on working memory. More specifically, control over the decision to use alcohol and other drugs requires working memory to integrate information related to previous consequences of substance use and current contingencies surrounding the decision to use. Reduced working memory capacity in these individuals might be more easily overloaded during the evaluation of this information, resulting in impulsive, maladaptive substance use decisions in the present and for the future. Indeed, several theories of impulsivity as a factor in drug abuse and in externalizing disorders, such as ADHD, posit a bi-directional relationship between working memory and inhibitory control. Consistent with this idea, studies have shown that low working memory ability is associated with greater trait impulsivity (e.g.,). Experimental manipulation of working memory load has revealed that increasing load to a capacity limit increases impulsive performance on a decision-making task. Also, research on the acute effects of alcohol on inhibitory control showed that the disinhibiting effects of the drug are, in part, due to the alcohol-induced reductions in information processing capacity. Taken together, these lines of evidence provide corroborating evidence for the important link between working memory and under-controlled behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5033, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A substantial amount of clinical research has characterized the neurocircuitry underlying cognitive control and working memory, as well as the network-level changes that occur as these processes are engaged. A recent meta-analysis of 193 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicated that the primary brain regions involved in the cognitive control of behavior, including prefrontal cortex regions, such as the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as well as the superior and inferior parietal cortices (sPar), precuneus and precentral gyrus. In general, these areas are part of an integrated dorsal processing stream involved in overlapping cognitive functions that is engaged in response to external demand. For example, engagement of the DLPFC, superior parietal cortices, ACC, striatum, thalamus and insula has been detected by fMRI during working memory tasks, in line with the performance requirements of those tasks, such as match mismatch detection and response inhibition (reviewed in). By contrast, when external demand is not present and the brain is considered to be in the default mode of functioning, activity is greater in brain areas such as the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). As external demand is imposed, activity typically decreases in the default-mode network and increases in cognitive control networks, consistent with the heuristics of a free energy framework for biological systems.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6551, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Altered brain activity has been demonstrated using fMRI during the performance of working memory tasks in individuals with substance use disorders. By way of introduction to the present study, the following overview focuses on research in adults with alcohol use disorder that used N-Back type tasks, which are well-established working memory tasks that have been adapted for use in a neuroimaging environment. While performing a 2-Back spatial working memory task, individuals with alcohol use disorder displayed reduced bilateral DLPFC activation compared to control participants when performing the task at equivalent level. In another study, emerging adult (i.e., 18\u201325 years old) women with alcohol use disorder and matched controls completed a task in which they were instructed to respond when an abstract line drawing appeared in a location that had been previously occupied. Participants with alcohol use disorder were less accurate on the task and had less activity in the right superior and inferior parietal, right middle frontal, right postcentral and left superior frontal cortex compared to controls. In a study that used a non-spatial 2-Back task, reduced activity was observed in the bilateral frontal and pre-central cortex and left superior temporal and parietal cortices of individuals with alcohol use disorder compared to social drinkers. Importantly, these impairments in working memory performance and altered activity in associated brain areas appear to be clinically significant. For example, individuals with alcohol use disorder who exhibited greater bilateral rostral and ventral lateral, prefrontal cortex activity given equivalent performance of a 2-Back task were more likely to remain abstinent through a 7 month post-treatment period.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8320, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A limitation of prior studies that have evaluated working memory performance and associated brain activity in individuals with alcohol use disorder is that a control group with similar alcohol use history has not been included to differentiate between alcohol exposure and problematic behaviors. Furthermore, those studies have not considered dynamic changes in brain activity and/or recruitment of other regions as a step-wise function of neurophysiological demand. Understanding how brain function changes in response to increasing task demand, however, could provide new insights into the neural resources (or lack thereof) available to meet the external constraints placed on the cognitive control processes needed for successful abstinence and/or recovery. The present study sought to extend previous work by comparing working memory performance and associated brain activity in individuals who met criteria for alcohol use disorder (heavy drinkers who were dependent; A-D) to a group with a comparable alcohol use history (heavy drinkers who were nondependent; A-ND), as well as a group of individuals who reported non-problematic alcohol use (CTRL). Further, this study included zero- (0-Back), low- (1-Back) and high- (2-Back) working memory load conditions. In addition to typical analyses examining brain activity during low (0-Back vs. 1-Back) and high (0-Back vs. 2- Back) working memory load conditions, the current study used a step-wise transitional approach to determine the concurrent increases and decreases in brain activity associated with transitioning to neurophysiological states with low (1-Back > 0-Back and 1-Back < 0-Back) and high (2-Back > 1-Back and 2-Back < 1-Back) external demand on neurophysiological resources. In this way, we sought to identify potential differences in the neurophysiological capacity associated with a critical cognitive process in individuals who vary in their alcohol use history and expression of problem drinking behaviors.

Heavy drinkers were further divided into individuals who did and did not meet criteria for alcohol dependence based on previously established SCID criteria and received additional questions about their alcohol use patterns.

Typical within-group analyses comparing brain activity during the zero and high load conditions of the task (0-Back vs. 2-Back; see supplementary data1) revealed that all three groups independently utilized brain regions previously demonstrated to be involved in attention and working memory processes, including the bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), superior parietal cortex (sPar) and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). All groups also independently displayed decreased activity in default-mode network brain areas, including portions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). That imposing task demands results in decreased activity in default-mode related brain areas and increased activity in attention and cognitive control brain areas is a finding consistent across neuroimaging studies using a variety of tasks to measure cognitive performance. Group comparisons of brain activity during the high working memory load condition (0-Back vs. 2-Back) revealed that A-D subjects had greater activity in both the mPFC and bilateral DLPFC compared to CTRL. Thus, A-D subjects displayed greater activity in portions of both default and attention/cognitive control networks during high working memory demand, suggesting that their impaired task performance might be related to an inability to suppress mPFC activity despite compensatory increases in the DLPFC to meet greater task demand. However, a limitation of that analytic approach and subsequent interpretation is that the comparison of 0-Back to 2-Back also includes physiological changes attributable to the low demand condition of the task (1-Back). Therefore, to better understand the relationship between the increasing demand placed neurophysiological resources and its relationship to problematic drinking, we initiated a step-wise analysis examining changes in behavior and brain activity associated with transitioning to a Low Demand state (e.g., 0-Back to 1-Back) and further to a High Demand state (e.g., 1-Back to 2-Back).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35838, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The transition to Low Demand did not differentially impact task performance across groups, whereas the transition to High Demand resulted in impaired accuracy in A-D relative to CTRL. In general, the results from the within-group analyses were suggestive of greater overall functional engagement at earlier demand in heavy drinkers relative to controls (compare within- group images in Fig. 2B to Fig. 3B). However, between-group comparisons only revealed significant differences in regional brain activity associated with the transition to the High Demand, which parallels the behavioral results. The results from those analyses indicated that A- ND had significantly greater activity in the sPar compared to A-D, and that mPFC activity was decreased to a greater degree in CTRL relative to A-D, during the transition to High Demand. The sPar is part of a dorsal processing stream that is related to attention and associated with performance on experimental tasks measuring various cognitive domains, including attention and memory. For example, the sPar was found to mediate visuospatial attention in a recent transcranial magnetic stimulation study. The mPFC, on the other hand, is part of the default-mode network and decreased activity in that network is consistent with a shift to a more attention-focused brain state. As noted above, a common interpretation is that activity in default- mode networks must decrease and/or desynchronize as neurophysiological resources are reallocated to meet experimental task demands. Inability to deactivate or disengage the mPFC has been associated with lapses in attention and increased errors on executive functioning tasks, and damage to the mPFC was shown to impair performance on the N-Back task. Together, these data suggest that limited engagement of the sPar and an inability to fully disengage the mPFC might be responsible for the impaired task performance observed in A-D at High Demand. Further, these between-group mPFC findings during the transition to High Demand are in agreement with the more typical analysis results reported above and suggest that the greater mPFC responses in A-D vs. CTRL during high working memory load (0-Back vs. 2- Back) were driven at least in part by decreasing mPFC activity in CTRL associated with the transition from low (1-Back) to high (2-Back) demand (confirmed by the within-group results).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38223, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One limitation of the present study is that more detailed information about participants\u2019 drinking patterns, in particular the number of drinks consumed on the same occasion, was not collected at the time the study was conducted. Participants were assigned to the control versus heavy drinking groups according to AUDIT scores, with individuals who scored 4 or less on the AUDIT being considered controls and individuals who scored 8 or greater considered heavy drinkers. However, the current categorization of heavy drinking by the United States National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Substance Abuse and Mental Services Health Administration (SAMHSA) relies on information about drinks consumed in a single occasion. More specifically, heavy drinking is defined as consuming 5 or more drinks on the same occasion on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days. Notwithstanding, the World Health Organization has used the AUDIT as an assessment tool for defining alcohol consumption and therefore the current results may more readily translate to international assessments of alcohol consumption. Future studies will include updated SAMHSA criteria when establishing experimental groups and will also focus on how the observed effects may relate to long-term alcohol dependent heavy drinkers (e.g., > 20 years) as well as individuals who do not yet report heavy consumption, but who are at-risk for alcohol abuse due to positive family history of alcoholism (FH+). For example, evidence if FH+ subjects showed the same decreased activation patterns to the High Demand transition compared with FH- subjects, those results would suggest that the differential behavior and brain profile observed here is a precursor to heavy alcohol consumption rather than a consequence. Lastly, because the current study did not record brain activity during a resting state, group differences in default-mode network activity during the transition into task engagement (i.e., 0-Back) could not be determined. Future studies should include the acquisition of resting state data in the same scanning session in order to model a larger range of neurophysiological transitions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40399, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.1 Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40414, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, the behavioral and brain changes observed in the current study suggest that working memory deficits in alcohol dependent individuals are associated with abnormal function of default and cognitive control brain networks in response to increasing task demands. These results further suggest that alcohol dependent individuals have less capacity for meeting the demand of increasing working memory loads. From a treatment standpoint, these results highlight two brain areas that could be targeted to improve clinical outcomes; namely, the mPFC (decreased response differentiating CTRL and A-D) and left sPar (increased response observed in A-ND but not A-D). One strategy is to enhance function in these areas through noninvasive brain stimulation or cognitive training combined with tasks known to engage them. For example, working memory training has been used to shift temporal discounting rates in cocaine users and it has been hypothesized that this training increases functional capacity in cognitive control networks. This approach might also be beneficial in alcohol dependent individuals, who have been shown to devalue future rewards. Functional enhancement of these target brain areas, resulting in the ability to meet larger external demand, may lead to more effective treatment outcomes in alcohol use disorder.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41751, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41774, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
