Studies have suggested that functional impairments in cognitive control associated brain circuitry contribute to a broad range of higher cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. To examine this issue, we assessed functional connectivity networks in healthy adults and individuals with schizophrenia performing tasks from two distinct cognitive domains that varied in demands for cognitive control, the RiSE episodic memory task and DPX goal maintenance task. We characterized general and cognitive control-specific effects of schizophrenia on functional connectivity within an expanded frontal parietal network (FPN) and quantified network topology properties using graph analysis. Using the network based statistic (NBS), we observed greater network functional connectivity in cognitive control demanding conditions during both tasks in both groups in the FPN, and demonstrated cognitive control FPN specificity against a task independent auditory network. NBS analyses also revealed widespread connectivity deficits in schizophrenia patients across all tasks. Furthermore, quantitative changes in network topology associated with diagnostic status and task demand were observed. The present findings, in an analysis that was limited to correct trials only, ensuring that subjects are on task, provide critical insights into network connections crucial for cognitive control and the manner in which brain networks reorganize to support such control.

Otherwise known as the clustering coefficient, it is a ratio of triangles to triplets in a graph, which measures the extent to which neighbors of a node also connect to each other. Increased transitivity, often associated with greater functional specialization, has been observed during cognitive control assessment using the color-word Stroop task. Thus we predict increased transitivity would be associated with a greater demand for cognitive control. Global efficiency, a measure of functional integration, describes how well a network can combine specialized information across distributed regions. Global efficiency is the inverse average shortest path length of a graph and is a measure of parallel information transfer. Previous magnetoencephalography and fMRI studies have observed increased global efficiency associated with task demand in working memory. Similarly, we predict increased global efficiency would be associated with a greater demand for cognitive control. Assortativity, an index of resilience, quantifies the correlation between the degree of a node and the mean degree of its nearest neighbors, which identifies the extent to which highly connected nodes are connected to other highly connected nodes. In highly assortative networks, high degree nodes (or hubs) are likely to be connected to each other, and thus are more resilient to disruption (e.g., removal of nodes) because the core of highly connected nodes provides redundant connections within the graph. We predict that increased assortativity will be associated with an increased demand for cognitive control.
