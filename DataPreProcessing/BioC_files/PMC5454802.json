Deficits in response inhibition, a key component of impulsivity, have been implicated as a core dysfunction in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD and addictions. Identification of genetically transmitted variation in the neural underpinnings of response inhibition can help to elucidate etiological pathways to these disorders and establish the links between genes, brain, and behavior. However, little is known about genetic influences on the neural mechanisms of response inhibition during adolescence, a developmental period characterized by weak self-regulation of behavior. Here we investigated heritability of ERPs elicited in a Go/No-Go task in a large sample of adolescent twins assessed longitudinally at ages 12, 14, and 16. Genetic analyses showed significant heritability of inhibition-related frontal N2 and P3 components at all three ages, with 50 to 60% of inter-individual variability being attributable to genetic factors. These genetic influences included both common genetic factors active at different ages and novel genetic influences emerging during development. Finally, individual differences in the rate of developmental changes from age 12 to age 16 were significantly influenced by genetic factors. In conclusion, the present study provides the first evidence for genetic influences on neural correlates of response inhibition during adolescence and suggests that ERPs elicited in the Go/No-Go task can serve as intermediate neurophysiological phenotypes (endophenotypes) for the study of disinhibition and impulse control disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1822, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Response inhibition is considered an essential facet of executive functioning and cognitive control, and weak response inhibition constitutes a key component of impulsivity. The neural dynamics underlying response inhibition has been extensively studied using brain event-related potential (ERPs),which represent a direct real-time measure of neuronal activity and permit the discrimination between consecutive stages of cognitive processing that unfold at the time scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Most ERP studies of response inhibition employ Go/No-Go tasks in which participants are instructed to respond to Go stimuli and to withhold their responses to No-Go stimuli, as well as stop-signal tasks in which participants have to stop the response triggered by a Go stimulus if a stop stimulus is presented shortly after the Go stimulus.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2960, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are two ERP components that have been consistently associated with response inhibition.

In contrast to N2, there is stronger evidence linking the No-Go P3 to response inhibition. Although studies comparing neural correlates of withholding of overt and covert responses suggested that No-Go P3 is related to both cognitive and motor inhibition, the P3 effect was greatly enhanced when motor inhibition was required. Thus, No-Go N2 and P3 represent distinct and temporally dissociable processes related to response inhibition: the N2 is implicated in the detection of conflict between a prepared response and the need to inhibit it, whereas No-Go P3 is seen as a manifestation of motor inhibition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4560, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "1.2.

Studies using source localization methods as well as studies combining fMRI and ERP measurement in the same Go/No-Go tasks have consistently associated the No-Go N2 component with the activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The sources for No-Go P3 were found in the ACC, premotor areas, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. More recently, neural substrates of N2 and P3 were further clarified by multimodal imaging studies capitalizing on high temporal resolution of EEG and high spatial resolution of fMRI. A study using separate ERP and fMRI recordings in the same subjects showed strong correlations between No-Go N2 and activation in the caudal part of the ACC and executive control regions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In a study with simultaneous EEG and fMRI recording during a stop-signal task, N2/P3 ERP complex produced by successful response inhibition was associated with activation in a functional network of regions known from previous fMRI studies to be involved in response inhibition, most notably, the anterior midcingulate cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, and the anterior insula. A subsequent review of source localization and imaging studies provided a more detailed account of separate brain regions implicated in N2 and P3 generation. Converging evidence suggests that N2 reflects activity in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices, with the medial source located in the anterior midcingulate region, in line with ERP source localization studies consistently implicating a generator in the ACC. Furthermore, in another study N2, but not P3, correlated with morphological variation in the anterior cingulate region. Frontocentral P3 showed associations with a broader network of regions including medial frontal and precentral regions, including the pre-SMA, anterior insulae, and temporoparietal regions.

Consistent with this evidence, ERP studies of response inhibition indicate substantial differences in inhibition-related brain activity between children and adults. A comparison of children at age 9 and young adults with respect to ERPs in a Go/No-Go task found a well-pronounced N2 component that was larger in children compared with adults, however, the No-Go P3 was absent in children. These results were corroborated in a subsequent study with an extended age range, a cross-sectional study comparing children at age 6\u20137 and 9\u201310 years and young adults suggested a decrease of N2 amplitude and increase of P3 with age. Convergent results were obtained in another cross-sectional study of children and adults: the N2 component assessed in an auditory Go/No-Go task diminished with age, while No-Go P3 showed a substantial increase. From the conflict monitoring perspective, the decrease in N2 amplitude may reflect a decrease in the level of experienced conflict, perhaps due to more efficient processing in the ACC. It is important to note that the same developmental pattern was observed in studies using visual and auditory stimuli, suggesting that No-Go ERP components and their developmental changes represent general, modality-independent neural processing underlying response inhibition. However, another study of children of 5\u201316 years of age reported an increase in both N2 and P3 components with age. This discrepancy may be related to task differences (the latter study involved using negative emotion induction) as well as small sample sizes in these studies.

Reduced No-Go P3 has been reported in both children and adult individuals with ADHD. Abnormal No-Go ERP components have been found in children with externalizing disorders: the clinical sample had larger N2 magnitudes and smaller frontal P3 magnitudes compared with controls. A study of juvenile delinquents with antisocial personality characteristics reported amplitude reduction of both N2 and P3 No-Go components. A study of adult psychopaths showed a marked reduction of the N2 component and a lack of No-Go P3 effect, with psychopaths showing the opposite direction of the Go versus No-Go difference compared to controls.

However, the opposite extreme, i.e. overactive response inhibition-related neural activation is not necessarily beneficial: an ERP study in children suggested that increased N2 (linked to the anterior cingulate cortical activity in that study) might be a biomarker inhibited social behavior and increased risk for later anxiety problems. Taken together, these data suggest a possibility that an intermediate level of inhibition-related activity may be most beneficial for adaptive behavior because it provides an optimal combination of control and flexibility of response production and suppression.

In summary, the present analyses lead to the following conclusions: 1) neural correlates of response inhibition undergo significant developmental changes during adolescence, with distinct subprocesses indicated by N2 and P3 (conflict processing and motor inhibition) showing different developmental trajectories; 2) despite these changes, individual differences remain relatively stable over age; 3) neural correlates of response inhibition are strongly influenced by genetic factors throughout adolescence, with little change in heritability over age; 4) these genetic influences include both common genetic factors active at different ages and novel genetic influences emerging during development, and 5) individual differences in developmental trajectory (the rate of change) in inhibition-related brain activity are significantly influenced by genetic factors. Taken together, these results significantly extend our previous finding of heritability of response-inhibition-related ERPs and provide novel insights into the interplay of genetic and developmental influences on the neural underpinnings of inhibitory control during a sensitive developmental period when deficits in inhibitory control may increase the risk for a range of maladaptive behaviors and psychopathology.

The divergence of developmental trajectories of No-Go N2 and P3 is consistent with the notion that these components reflect distinct cognitive processes. Accumulating evidence suggests that N2 reflects the detection of conflict associated with the need to suppress a pre-activated response by the anterior cingulate, whereas No-Go P3 reflects inhibition-related activity in a broader network of regions involving the ACC, supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the fronto-parietal network. A study using EEG and fMRI revealed 2 systems related to RI: the ACC and a network including right prefrontal and parietal areas. Furthermore, it was shown that absent-minded subjects tended to rely more on the ACC system, whereas subjects low on the absentmindedness score showed a stronger and more selective use of the frontoparietal system. In light of these findings, it is reasonable to suggest that opposite developmental changes of N2 and P3 reflect a changing balance in the relative role of ACC and more extended inhibition network in the processing of No-Go stimuli, such that decreasing activation of the ACC is paralleled by increasing engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal areas and the frontoparietal network.

First, the notion of heritability pertains to the population, not a single individual, and refers to genetic determination of inter-individual variance but not individual value of a trait. Second, heritability does not imply that individual values of the trait and the population mean value are unchangeable. In particular, individual values and, accordingly, the population mean value of a certain trait can be elevated in a given population due to e.g. enriched environment or training, but individual differences may still be highly heritable. In fact, there is evidence that response inhibition-related ERP can be modified by directed training. Children aged 8\u201312 with externalizing problems showed larger N2 and smaller P3 amplitudes relative to controls, but a 3-month cognitive behavioral therapy program resulted in modification of these ERP responses, moreover, greater clinical improvement after treatment was associated with a decrease of N2 amplitude.
