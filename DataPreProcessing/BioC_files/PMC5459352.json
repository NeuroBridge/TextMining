The dysconnectivity hypothesis suggests these disruptions are due to aberrant brain connectivity. Many studies have identified connectivity differences but few have been able to unify gray and white matter findings into one model. Here we develop an extension of the Network-Based Statistic (NBS) called NBSm (Multimodal Network-based statistic) to compare functional and anatomical networks in schizophrenia. Structural, resting functional, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 29 chronic patients with schizophrenia and 29 healthy controls. Images were preprocessed, and average time courses were extracted for 90 regions of interest (ROI). Functional connectivity matrices were estimated by pairwise correlations between wavelet coefficients of ROI time series. Following diffusion tractography, anatomical connectivity matrices were estimated by white matter streamline counts between each pair of ROIs. Global and regional strength were calculated for each modality. NBSm was used to find significant overlap between functional and anatomical components that distinguished health from schizophrenia. Global strength was decreased in patients in both functional and anatomical networks. Regional strength was decreased in all regions in functional networks and only one region in anatomical networks. NBSm identified a distinguishing functional component consisting of 46 nodes with 113 links (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), a distinguishing anatomical component with 47 nodes and 50 links (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and a distinguishing intermodal component with 26 nodes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). NBSm is a powerful technique for understanding network-based group differences present in both anatomical and functional data.

A common strategy to construct a graph is to threshold a connectivity matrix to retain only the very strongest and/or most statistically significant edges. To compare graphs between two groups, the threshold is often chosen for each matrix independently in order to ensure that all networks, irrespective of group, contain the same number of edges. However, it has been noted that for very stringent thresholds, networks derived from one population can fragment (some nodes become completely disconnected from the graph, having no remaining edges) while networks derived from a second population can remain intact. This phenomenon has been reported to occur in resting state fMRI data acquired from people with schizophrenia. In this context, fragmentation has been linked to underlying network developmental abnormalities. Comparing fragmented and non-fragmented networks is problematic because network diagnostic values are highly dependent on the number of nodes present in the network. In addition to the challenges of the differential fragmentation processes, this common approach also focuses on only the strongest set of edges although recent evidence suggests that in fact weakly connected portions of the network might be particularly important in distinguishing healthy and diseased resting state function in schizophrenia, and uncovering changes in network organization that underlie individual differences in cognitive function.

While graph theory is a powerful tool, its metrics can be biased and sensitive to shortcomings and variability in the underlying data and/or data processing techniques. This has been examined in-depth in the literature but warrants discussion of specific considerations. Graph theory relies on accurate and reliable definition of nodes and edges, with edges having the strength of connectivity defined based on the value of underlying data. Should the node or edge definition be unreliable, then the composite network measures will also be unreliable. and have shown that simple thresholding of networks, a common practice used in neuroimaging graph theory to find subnetworks of interest, is an unreliable method causing a larger likely variation in the graph statistics compared to non-thresholded metrics such as streamline counts or functional connectivity. Further, have shown that second order metrics (small-worldness, hierarchy, and assortativity) are more robust than first order metrics (clustering coefficient, path length, efficiency). Garrison et al. suggests measures of sparsity are reliable at defining subnetworks of interest whereas Drakesmith et al. suggests a multi-threshold technique. NBS and our extension NBSm take a similar approach, by avoiding a first order threshold technique, to discover relevant subnetworks based on the statistical difference in edge strength between groups.

First, use of DTI has been shown to produce elevated false negatives which could alter the subsequent components produced by NBSm. Newer diffusion paradigms and analysis tools are available and have been shown to be more sensitive at detecting crossing tracts as well as local connectivity tracts. We did not have motion parameter data for our DTI. While we found no motion group differences in the fMRI data, this does not necessarily mean there was no motion differences in the DTI data. Second, the validity of our findings may be limited by the short fMRI acquisition length of 6\u00a0min, as has been shown elsewhere in the literature. New multiband techniques are now available and have been shown to reduce scanning time and increase sensitivity to detect resting state brain networks. Third, our anatomical connectivity matrix is likely sensitive to varying brain size. This has been shown to be a common finding in those with schizophrenia. This is a possible limitation of our findings as the analysis was performed in native space and there was no normalization step performed prior to subsequent analysis. Fourth, our parcellation technique is an anatomical parcellation and makes use of the AAL atlas. While this method has been shown to be rapid, intuitive, and reliable it is low resolution, and has large variations in node size which can impact on the reproducibility of connectivity patterns. Future work could utilize subject-specific structural imaging driven parcellations. For example, evaluated the effects of this sort of parcellation scheme using 140 nodes with structural imaging, and found it to be effective for modelling slow resting state network changes, specifically those found in fMRI. This could provide more reproducible connectivity patterns to use with NBSm. Fifth, in our participants with schizophrenia, neuroleptic medications were being used at differing doses. This has been shown to have significant but unpredictable effects on functional connectivity. Future studies should attempt to normalize neuroleptic dosing across participants.
