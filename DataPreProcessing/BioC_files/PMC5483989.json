We did not observe a prospective association between age 20 reward-related brain function and age 22 circadian preference. This suggests that the oft-noted cross-sectional associations between circadian preference and reward-related processes and behaviors are not primarily driven by impulsive, reward-seeking behavior, and/or substance use leading to later bedtimes and rise times.

The finding for alcohol dependence held after accounting for earlier (age 20) symptoms of alcohol dependence, concurrent alcohol use, and concurrent daily smoking. The indirect effect on alcohol use no longer remained statistically significant after including earlier (age 20) alcohol use in the model. Although zero-order correlations suggested that a similar indirect path between eveningness and cannabis use via mPFC response to winning rewards, the indirect path was not statistically significant in the full model. Together, the findings suggest that alcohol dependence may be more sensitive than alcohol or marijuana use to the effects of circadian preference on the mPFC response to winning rewards.

That is, our findings differed both in terms of direction of association (positive versus negative association between eveningness and reward activation) and stage of reward processing (outcome versus anticipation). Several possible factors could explain these different patterns of association. First, our prior report looked at cross-sectional, rather than longitudinal associations, and the associations between circadian preference, mPFC reactivity to reward, and alcohol dependence may differ over time. Second, neurodevelopmental changes in the mPFC and/or its connectivity with the VS may underlie these shifting associations with circadian preference and alcohol dependence. Third, our prior analytic approach focused on portions of the mPFC and VS that correlated with eveningness, whereas the current approach focused on task-defined mPFC and VS clusters. In particular, the subregions of the mPFC in the current analyses appear to be somewhat more dorsal and rostral (particularly Brodmann area 9) than those in our prior paper, which extended more into the anterior dorsal and pregenual anterior cingulate (particularly Brodmann area 32).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32081, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As noted, we predicted based on our prior work that eveningness would be associated with a lower mPFC response during reward anticipation, but instead found an association with higher mPFC response during reward outcome only. The apparent difference in task phase may be less surprising; in the prior paper the mPFC showed parallel responses during reward anticipation and outcome, but only the anticipation response met statistical criteria for reporting in the paper. Furthermore, although the anticipation and outcome phases conceptually map onto \u201cwanting\u201d and \u201cliking\u201d processes that have been differentially related to different stages of addiction, findings based on fMRI studies of monetary reward tasks have not always clearly fit with conceptual predictions. However, it is more difficult to reconcile why opposite patterns of mPFC response would be associated with alcohol dependence. The current findings also diverge from another prior paper from our group in which young adults (M age = 27.2) meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence exhibited lower mPFC response during the outcome phase of this same monetary reward task in comparison to a group of healthy controls. Furthermore, within the alcohol-dependent group, those with a family history of alcohol dependence showed even lower mPFC response. [We] speculated in that paper that the lower mPFC response could reflect compromised modulation of reward processing in a manner that might facilitate alcohol problems. Notably, that paper used a different contrast (win versus loss) during the fMRI analyses. The different contrast, the inclusion of females, and higher prevalence of clinically signficant alcohol dependence could account for the discrepancies with the present findings. Noting another recent finding of increased mPFC response to reward outcome (using a variant of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task) that was correlated with greater alcohol use and trait-level disinhibition (, we speculate that this increased mPFC response to reward outcome may represent compromised process of performance monitoring among those with greater eveningness.

The circadian preference of these \u201cintermediate-types\u201d may be relatively more determined by differential rates in the accumulation of homeostatic sleep drive  than circadian factors per se, and thus may show distinct associations with reward-related processes.

Use of a self-report measure of circadian preference does not allow parsing of circadian, homeostatic, and/or personality contributions to the observed associations. Furthermore, the CSM\u2019s internal consistency fell into the questionable range for this sample. Followup studies should include physiological measures of circadian phase, electroencephalographic measures of homeostatic sleep processes, and/or prospective measures of sleep timing to help disentangle the specific sleep/circadian factors. For example, we are unable to assess whether our findings were influenced by recent sleep loss, which is important to consider given prior evidence that sleep loss influences reward-related brain function. Our mediation analyses are limited by the assessment schedule, in which age 22 fMRI and substance assessments occurred concurrently, thus precluding the temporal ordering needed to demonstrate mediation. In addition to longitudinal studies that better sequence assessments of circadian preference, brain function, and substance involvement, experimental studies are needed to best ascertain causality. Another limitation is that the test-retest reliability of the card-guessing task has not been established, and the 2-year timeframe of our study is not appropriate for assessing test-retest reliability given the myriad of developmental and environmental changes occurring during this period. This is a pervasive issue in the neuroimaging field and future work (and funding) should be devoted to establishing test-retest reliabilities of tasks. The issue may be slightly mitigated by published evidence that the VS response to a similar reward task showed good test-retest reliability over two weeks.
