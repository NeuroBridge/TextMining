The dampened medial prefrontal response to positive images was also found among female users when compared to male users. The mPFC and ACC are involved in evaluation and interpretation of stimuli, salience detection, and motivation. There is evidence that in general women have a heightened mPFC/ACC response to emotional stimuli, which may be why the decrements found in the current study were more significant for cocaine-dependent women compared to controls than they were for men. The disruption in the mPFC/ACC function may be especially important for cocaine-dependent women, as these regions are implicated in normal responsivity to infant cues and could underlie the disruptions in caregiving and bonding with offspring often seen with addicted mothers. One explanation for this hypoactivity could be related to the high rates of trauma and/or abuse often found among substance-dependent women. An attenuated response to emotional stimuli in the ventral ACC and mPFC has been linked with trauma, and could suggest that the dampened emotional response among women developed as a coping mechanism when exposed to unpleasant stimuli. However, no participant in the current study met the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. This potentially important factor should be explored in future research.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25242, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Limitations include the fact that the analyses by gender are likely not sufficiently powered to provide definitive evidence of a gender-specific attenuation to nondrug stimuli among female cocaine users (10 individuals per gender user group). The current study also included a relatively small number of individuals in the gender analyses (10 per each gender user group). Moreover, the results observed among the small number of female cocaine users may be affected by the hormonal milieu, which has been shown to potentially modulate the reinforcing effects of drugs. Future studies are needed to determine the effect of menstrual cycle phase, menopausal status, and contraceptive use on these gender-specific results. Additionally, our cocaine-dependent participants were polydrug users, almost half of whom had co-occurring marijuana dependence and most of whom were cigarette smokers. We did not find that the marijuana-dependent cocaine users had further attenuation in fronto-limbic regions, but they did have decreased reactivity for positive images. Additionally, 17 of the cocaine users were cigarette smokers (compared to 3 controls), which makes it difficult to disentangle the roles of cocaine dependence and nicotine dependence. In an effort to examine these potential contributing factors, in a covariate analysis, we found one cluster in the left parahippocampal gyrus/temporal lobe to be positively correlated with number of cigarettes smoked among the user group in this sample, though the activation did not overlap with our primary findings. Still, previous research has shown that depression severity and smoking status affect response to emotion-related stimuli, so they cannot be ruled out as affecting the attenuated responding among the cocaine users. Having arousal or valence ratings from the participants while in the scanner would have provided more insight into the emotional processing among the users, and it should be explored in a future study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27220, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite the limitations to our knowledge, this is the first study to use a mixed-gender sample to examine the neural response to general emotional stimuli in cocaine-dependent polydrug using individuals. With growing momentum for unique, patient-tailored intervention strategies for cocaine users, these data present a window of opportunity for innovation. For example, while much of the emphasis in both basic and clinical addiction research focuses on eliminating the reinforcing strength of the drug and dampening craving, an alternative focus on increasing the reinforcing strength of an alternative reinforcer and amplifying the neural reactivity to these nondrug-related rewards may prove fruitful. Basic science models of addiction have explored the power of choice behavior for decades, typically employing a two-choice level pressing paradigm in one lever results in drug delivery, while the other results in delivery of an alternate reinforcer (such as food or sweetened water; 52\u201355). These data suggest that, as in clinical contingency management programs, drug taking can be attenuated by increasing the value of alternate positive reinforcers (56). As addiction research continues to innovate, data from this study and others like it may serve as a platform for the development of treatment strategies that focus on increasing the neural response to naturally available nondrug reinforcers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28625, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary
