Consequently, most of the group differences occur in connectivity states with relatively middle range frequency profiles, e.g. HC state 5 whose a frequency profile peaks at around ~\u00a00.17\u00a0Hz and is minimally correlated with any SZ states, and also SZ states 3 and 5, which together cover a range of middle frequencies between 0.07\u00a0Hz to 0.17\u00a0Hz. There is recognizable unique modularity in these states. For example, in SZ state 2 we clearly observe relatively strong and positive correlation between all the subcortical (SC), auditory (AUD), and visual (VIS) networks. At the same time, however, uniquely among all of the SZ and HC-specific states, SZ state 2 features negative correlations between somatomotor (SM) networks and the SC, AUD and VIS networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence for this particular pattern of connectivity in schizophrenia patients, and it is only identifiable when connectivity is analyzed jointly in time and frequency. Among the HC states, state 5 exhibits the most similar modular patterning to SZ state 2 but with a different connectivity pattern between SC and AUD/VIS networks (anti-correlated in HC state 5, positively correlated in SZ state 2) and between SM and AUD/VIS (positively correlated in HC state 5, anti-correlated in SZ state2). Previous studies have reported hyper-connectivity between the thalamic and sensory networks in schizophrenia patients, which here appears as a positive connectivity between all subcortical and sensory networks compared to negative connectivity in HCs between the same networks. Again such modularity only exists in the joint domain since: first, this modularity occurs in states with a unique frequency profiles (having a mid to high frequency range) and could not be captured when states were estimated over all frequencies (as is the case in conventional dynamic connectivity studies); and second, it is different from some other states with which it has an overlapping frequency profile.

Note that in this set, states are shared among all subjects. Our analysis shows significant differences between the groups based on both measurements. Core observations from this set of results is that first, we see that patients have higher occupancy rates and longer dwell times in state 1, a hypoconnected state associated with mid and high range frequency profile. The significant association of patients with this state pulls together two disparate and consistent findings from previous studies: First, patient network time-courses have more high frequency content than controls and second, patients' networks tend to be more weakly (hypo) connected than those of controls. We also see that healthy and patients have different occupancy rates in states 2 and 5 which are observed at the lowest frequencies and exhibiting similar modular patterning \u2013 except for the valency of subcortical connections to Aud/Vis/SM (negative for state 5, positive for state 2). State 5 with a narrower frequency profile and a sharper modularization and a stronger connections between SC and Aud/Vis/SM, as compared to state 2, is more occupied by HCs while state 2 is more occupied by SZs. Similarly, state 3 with a mid-range frequencies profile, is more occupied by HCs. State 3 looks like a washed out version of state 5 but having a broader frequency profile while sharing the negative SC-to-Aud/Vis/SM connectivity which however is more sharply exhibited by state 5.
