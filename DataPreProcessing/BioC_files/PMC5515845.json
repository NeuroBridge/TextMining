The volume in the hippocampus positively correlated with the symptom severity of IGD.

The volume in the cerebellum correlated with impaired working memory function as well as duration of illness in AUD group.

As IGD has been considered to be a significant public health issue, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth-edition (DSM-V) recently included IGD as a condition for further study. IGD has been conceptualized as a behavioral addiction and shares neuropsychological characteristics with substance use disorders (SUD) including cravings, withdrawal during abstinence, and tolerance. In addition, impaired decision-making and inhibitory control that are key features of SUD are frequently observed in individuals with IGD. Therefore, the underlying neural mechanisms of IGD are hypothesized to overlap with those of SUD. However, IGD dose not entail brain exposure to toxic agents, which renders it different from SUD. To achieve a clear understanding of the neurobiological features of IGD and to establish IGD as a formal disorder, we need to directly compare the brain changes in IGD with those in SUD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2671, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, several cortical morphometry studies have found possible neural mechanisms underlying IGD. The brain regions associated with impulsivity and executive control, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex have consistently shown decreased gray matter volume and thinner cortical thickness in IGD individuals comparing to healthy controls (HCs). Moreover, the changes in these brain regions showed correlations with disease severity or cognitive control deficit, which support the important role of the prefrontal area in IGD. In addition to prefrontal area, previous studies have also shown changes in other brain system, such as reward, learning and memory and motor and sensory system. IGD individuals showed decreased volume in supplementary motor area and visual association area, increased volume in the thalamus, and increased cortical thickness in the precentral and middle temporal cortices, which might be associated with excessive motor and sensory processing during Internet game play. Several studies have also found decreased gray matter volume in the amygdala and striatum as a part of brain reward system, and increased cortical thickness in the precunues that is associated attention and memory retrieval. Gaming experience also associated with structural changes in healthy subjects. The amount of lifetime video gaming was positively associated with bilateral hippocampal, parahippocampal and occipital volume. In addition, gray matter volume in the right hippocampus and DLPFC significantly increased after intense video gaming training and these increased volume correlated with desire to paly game. These results suggested that the long-time gaming exposure might be related with changes in brain memory and executive control system, and these changes could be a possible mechanism of excessive game playing.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4570, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Findings in recent several functional neuroimaging studies comparing between IGD and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are in line with the previous brain structure studies of IGD. AUD, a representative type of SUD, shares features related to emotion, temperament, and personality as well as aforementioned behavior symptoms with IGD. Both IGD and AUD groups showed increased regional homogeneity in the posterior cingulate cortex, and positive functional connectivity in the cingulate gyrus and cerebellum, and negative functional connectivity in the orbitofrontal cortex on the DLPFC-seeded functional connectivity analysis. These results suggest that both IGD and AUD groups may have common problems with control of response inhibition and executive function. On the other hand, IGD also showed reduced regional homogeneity in the superior temporal gyrus, and lower absolute beta power than AUD group and HCs. On the DLPFC-seeded functional connectivity analysis, individuals with IGD showed positive functional connectivity in the striatum and temporal area, while individuals with AUD showed negative functional connectivity in these areas. These differences were suggested as results of excessive processing of audio and visual gaming information in IGD. Taken together, not only did these functional neuroimaging studies comparing IGD to AUD demonstrated that IGD shared neurobiological mechanisms with AUD, but they also clarified unique characteristics of functional brain changes associated with gaming experience in IGD.

Additionally, we evaluated the functional connectivity of the brain regions showing significant morphological changes in IGD. It is unclear whether gray matter volume alterations are directly related to altered functional connectivity within brain networks. However, recent studies with psychiatric disorders identified alterations of resting-state functional connectivity using altered gray matter volume as the seed ROI, which provided more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural circuitry of disorders than when only morphological changes investigated.

Considerable evidences suggest that the hippocampus and amygdala play a critical role in the acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of learning of addiction-related cues that leads to compulsive addictive behavior. Lesioning or pharmacological inactivation of either the hippocampus or amygdala diminished cue-induced drug-seeking behaviors, and disconnection between the amygdala and hippocampus inhibited reconsolidation of cocaine-related associative memories. Human neuroimaging studies have found that cue-induced cravings are associated with increased activation in the amygdala and hippocampus among cocaine-dependent subjects and pathological gamblers. Consistent findings have been also reported in the IGD. Individuals with IGD have exhibited increased activity in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus triggered by gaming cues, and this activity was correlated with the self-reported desire for games. More recent studies have found structural changes in the hippocampus related to gaming experience. The amount of lifetime video gaming was positively correlated with the bilateral hippomcapal and parahippocampal volume, and gray matter volume in the right hippocampus significantly increased after video gaming training in HCs.

In individuals with online gaming addiction, the vmPFC showed increased gaming-cue related activity, and the activation was positively correlated with gaming urge. It is known that the vmPFC and hippocampus are coupled with each other to mediate memory-guided choices and retrieval-mediated learning process. Internet gaming provides diverse content and information using multisensory stimuli in novel situations and creates high arousal and sensory overload. Moreover, game playing requires an active working memory system and sustained visual and auditory attention. Therefore, the lager volumes in the hippocampus/amygdala, its significant correlation with symptom severity, and stronger functional connectivity with the vmPFC that were observed in the present study might be associated with experience-dependent changes related to stronger memories for Internet game-related cues or responses subsequent to Internet gaming, or they may reflect factors that render individuals vulnerable to frequent or strong cravings for Internet gaming.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20338, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Similar with the hippocampus, the precuneus contributes to cue-induced cravings in IGD as well as SUD and pathologic gambling.

Previous neuroimaging studies have repeatedly reported structural changes in the prefrontal cortex, supporting the contributing role of the prefrontal cortex to IGD. In the present study, however, there were no significant reduced volume or thickness in the prefrontal cortex in the individuals with IGD. Moreover, our IGD individuals showed normal performance on executive function tests. Previous researches with IGD showing significantly decreased volume or thickness in the prefrontal cortex were studied in adolescents or average of 19 years old with standard deviation of 1\u20132 years. While, the mean age of IGD individuals in the present study was 22.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2 years old. Other VBM studies with IGD subjects of the similar ages with ours did not find significant changes in the prefrontal area. Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period, with maturation of gray- and white matter and age-related increases in cognitive function and social behavior. Therefore, it is possible that adolescents have different neural substrate of IGD from young adults. Particularly, the prefrontal cortex is the last cortical region to reach full gray matter maturation in early adulthood, so Internet gaming might affect more immature prefrontal cortex in adolescence than prefrontal cortex in adults. The different brain morphological changes between adolescence and adults with IGD should be addressed in the further studies. Meanwhile, there were only two cortical thickness studies with IGD, and the results have some contradiction each other, therefore, it is suggested that the cortical thickness is not robust measurement for evaluation of brain changes in IGD. In line with this suggestion, present study did not found significant differences in IGD compared to HD or AUD.

Early postmortem brain and neuroimaging studies have consistently shown alcohol-related reductions in the number of neurons and in the cortical volume, with marked losses in the prefrontal and cerebellar areas, and whole-brain morphometric studies of AUD also confirmed the brain abnormalities including the prefrontal and cerebellar regions. Recent brain morphology studies have suggested that the neurotoxic effects of alcohol disrupt typical neurodevelopment in the prefrontal and cerebellar regions. Adolescents and young adults with adolescent-onset AUD had reduced volume in the prefrontal cortex compared with controls, and males with AUD additionally showed reduced volume in the cerebellar hemisphere. Furthermore, reduced gray matter volume in the prefrontal area and cerebellum was correlated with the age at which adults with AUD started drinking. Mashhoon et al. found reduced cortical thickness in the aMCC of emerging adults with binge-drinking relative to light-drinking adults, and the altered aMCC thickness was negatively correlated with the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. These results suggest that an early-onset of drinking impedes the maturation of the prefrontal and cerebellar regions. In the present study, the participants with AUD were younger than those in other studies of AUD, and all the AUD individuals had started to drink alcohol either during adolescence or young adulthood. Thus, the abnormalities in the cerebellum and medial frontal cortex that were found in the present study support the vulnerability of these regions to early-onset drinking.

The first 10 volumes of the functional time series were discarded. The remaining 170 volumes were subjected to slice timing correction, and to realigning with a six-parameter spatial transformation. Data from participants with head-motion exceeding 2.0\u2009mm of maximal rotation and 2.0\u00b0 of any angular motion during the scan were eliminated from the analysis. Data of 2 IGD subjects, 4 AUD subjects and 3 HCs were excluded from functional connectivity analysis according to this criterion. Then, all data were spatially normalized to MNI space and were smoothed with 4-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. The images were subsequently detrended to remove linear trends and temporally band-pass filtered (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to remove physiological and high frequency noise. Friston 24 motion parameters, global signal, WM signal and CSF signal were regressed out as nuisance signals from the filtered images of each participant. Additionally, to remove the potential confounding effects of micro-movements on resting-state functional connectivity, we applied scrubbing for each motion-outlier.

The mean framewise displacement (FD) in the entire fMRI scans were 0.168\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 before scrubbing and 0.156\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 after scrubbing.
