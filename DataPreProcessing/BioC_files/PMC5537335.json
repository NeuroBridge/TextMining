For instance, a critical role in the maintenance of tobacco addiction is reserved for the interaction between environment and corresponding neural events; i.e. drug-related cues in the environment are paired with the rewarding physiological effects of nicotine. After repeated pairing and reinforcement of these cues, they become highly salient, triggering the urge to smoke (Robinson and Berridge; Benowitz). In this process, these motivationally relevant smoking cues have been shown to automatically and involuntarily capture the smoker\u2019s selective attention (Mogg and Bradley; Hogarth et al.; Field and Cox). The resulting attention bias exhibited by smokers is associated with increased craving and has been implicated in maintaining addictive behaviour and provoking relapses (Bradley et al.; Janes et al.; Austin and Duka). Additionally, nicotine abstinence has been shown to increase subjective craving in response to smoking cues and enhance attention bias, making it even more difficult for (ex-)smokers to remain abstinent (Gross et al.; Sayette and Hufford; Waters and Feyerabend; Zack et al.; Field et al.). Thus, even existing smoking cessation treatments will be less effective as long as smokers are still automatically being attracted to these craving-eliciting cues. Accordingly, there is a need for new (additional) treatments targeting extinction of automatic responses to smoking cues. More knowledge about the exact underlying mechanisms can be essential in the process of developing those.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3531, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Functional imaging studies have shown that craving-provoking drug cues elicit a response in a network of frontal brain regions, mainly consisting of the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Wilson et al.). This is not surprising, since these areas are connected to the dopaminergic mesolimbic reward pathway which becomes activated in response to actual drug exposure (Brody). The amygdala is believed to enhance identification of emotionally salient stimuli (like conditioned drug cues) (Phillips et al.), whereas the areas in the prefrontal cortex play a key role in the guidance of goal-directed and motivational behaviour. Specifically, the OFC is thought to integrate and modulate activity from several limbic areas (such as the amygdala) involved in reward processing (Volkow and Fowler), and the dlPFC is implicated in regulatory processing and decision-making (Watanabe et al.). The ACC, in addition, has been associated with conflict monitoring in the presence of competing response alternatives (Kerns et al.). Reactivity of these areas to smoking cues may therefore reflect a process of deciding whether or not to resist the urge to smoke. Although findings are somewhat inconsistent across studies, increased activation in response to smoking cues is mostly reported in brain regions related to reward and motivational processing as well as in the frontal and parietal attentional networks (David et al.; Brody et al.; Franklin et al.; Rubinstein et al.; Luijten et al.; Claus et al.). Activation of these regions in response to smoking cues is evident, since it reflects the rewarding value of the cues and the motivational and attentional processes guiding drug-seeking behaviour (Engelmann et al.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5322, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Nonetheless, these areas are located relatively late in the pathway through which visual information is processed. That is, impulses are first transmitted from the primary visual cortex via the extrastriate cortex to higher-order visual association areas. From there, projections finally go to multimodal processing regions including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (Tanaka). Interestingly, return connections of the amygdala to various levels of the ventral stream are thought to enhance sensory processing of emotionally salient stimuli in the visual cortex (Amaral et al.). So although salience attribution is situated in higher-processing stages (Goldstein and Volkow), it may well influence earlier visual processing in a top-down fashion. Even more specifically, a study by Murray and Wojciulik has shown that top-down attention increased not just activity but also neural selectivity in the lateral occipital complex, a region involved in the visual processing of objects and shapes (Murray and Wojciulik). Thus, one mechanism by which a smoker\u2019s attention could be biased towards (salient) visual smoking cues may be via increased processing in the extended visual system.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6506, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In accordance with this hypothesis, there is some evidence for increased activation in areas of the primary visual and extrastriate cortices in response to smoking cues (Due et al.; Janes et al.; Engelmann et al.; Havermans et al.). Nevertheless, the evidence remains scarce, and existing theories on attention bias have explicitly argued for a role of the brain\u2019s reward pathway and not the extended visual system in this process (Everitt and Robbins; Robinson and Berridge). A reason for the inconclusive neuroimaging evidence for the involvement of the visual system could be that visual processing of salient smoking cues is only slightly enhanced compared to neutral cues, since no motivational value has been attributed in this stage of processing. Standard univariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis techniques might not be sufficiently sensitive to detect such subtle effects. Furthermore, in several of these cue reactivity studies, the participants had been smoking before scanning (Janes et al.; Engelmann et al.). Since smoking cues are of greater salience and relevance for deprived smokers than for satiated smokers (Robinson and Berridge), this may have minimized the saliency\u2014and thereby the enhanced visual processing\u2014of the smoking cues.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7784, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the current study, we use functional MRI and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to investigate basic visual processing of smoking-related objects in tobacco-addicted participants. This method allows us to consider the pattern of activity of the total amount of voxels in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), instead of analysing each voxel independently and looking at the average response of the whole region. By employing the spatial distribution of neural responses in this way, pattern analysis techniques are able to pick up information that is too subtle to be discovered by traditional univariate analyses (De Martino et al.; Mur et al.; Mahmoudi et al.; Tong and Pratte; Woolgar et al.). In the current study, we use functional MRI and a linear classification algorithm (support vector machine (SVM); Cortes and Vapnik) to investigate whether smoking-related visual cues are processed differently when a smoker is deprived of nicotine compared to a satiated state. We investigated the discriminability of neural responses to cigarette images and visually comparable pencil images immediately after the participant has smoked a cigarette, and compare this to the discriminability of the responses when the smoker is craving for nicotine. We hypothesize that the neural responses will grow more distinct for the smoking-related cues in the latter situation, as these stimuli will be increasingly behaviourally relevant.

From this, we conclude that the effect of abstinence on behaviour can at least be traced back to a basic level of visual object processing. This indicates that the mechanism by which a smoker\u2019s attention is biased towards smoking cues potentially affects processing in the early visual system, and is not confined to only higher-order motivation and reward-related areas as is generally emphasized in the literature (Volkow et al.; Hester and Luijten; Jasinska et al.).

In addition, Davis et al. used simulations to point out that a significant decoding performance does not allow for drawing conclusion about the underlying nature of the representations (Davis et al.). However, our experimental design is set up to address the question whether certain neural responses are affected by the level of nicotine deprivation. Although we cannot draw firm conclusions on the directionality of the effect, we interpret our results in light of what is known about the psychological effect of addictive substances. If the multivariate distance between two object categories (one of which is related to the addiction) increases as an effect of nicotine deprivation, it is not the statistics that drive the interpretation of directionality.

We therefore chose for a conservative way to quantify our results: Instead of testing our classification results against chance level (i.e. 50%), we have empirically estimated the distribution of prediction accuracies when there is no relationship between the conditions and underlying response patterns.

Therefore, it is possible that the smoking cues were not as attractive or attention-grabbing for them as they would have been for highly dependent individuals. Hence, for more dependent smokers, patterns of activity related to smoking cues may have been better discriminable from those related to neutral cues. Moreover, highly dependent smokers would have been more affected by the nicotine deprivation condition, possibly increasing discriminability between smoking and neutral cues in the deprived condition even more. In addition, it is striking that our deprivation condition was not successful in inducing craving or other withdrawal symptoms. This could be due to a too short, and overnight, abstinence period, during which participants only missed a few cigarettes. For instance, an abstinence period of 16\u00a0h has been shown to reliably induce craving (Jarvik et al.), while our participants were abstinent for only 12\u00a0h on average.
