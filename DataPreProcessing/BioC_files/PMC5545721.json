We hypothesized that co-expression pathways of SCZ risk genes are associated with system-level brain function and clinical phenotypes of SCZ. We examined genetic variants related to the dopamine D2 receptor gene DRD2 co-expression pathway and associated them with working memory (WM) behavior, the related brain activity and treatment response. Using two independent post-mortem prefrontal messenger RNA (mRNA) data sets (total N=249), we identified a DRD2 co-expression pathway enriched for SCZ risk genes. Next, we identified non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with co-expression of this pathway. These SNPs were associated with regulatory genetic loci in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P<0.05). We summarized their compound effect on co-expression into a Polygenic Co-expression Index (PCI), which predicted DRD2 pathway co-expression in both mRNA data sets (all P<0.05). We associated the PCI with brain activity during WM performance in two independent samples of healthy individuals (total N=368) and 29 patients with SCZ who performed the n-back task. Greater predicted DRD2 pathway prefrontal co-expression was associated with greater prefrontal activity and longer WM reaction times (all corrected P<0.05), thus indicating inefficient WM processing. Blind prediction of treatment response to antipsychotics in two independent samples of patients with SCZ suggested better clinical course of patientswith greater PCI (total N=87; P<0.05).

With respect to SCZ risk, the DRD2 gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor is an optimal candidate to investigate the genetic architecture of molecular pathways affected in patients with SCZ. A long-standing hypothesis holds that dopaminergic dysfunctional regulation in subcortical areas and in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key pathophysiological mechanism of SCZ. For example, working memory (WM) deficits, among the core symptoms in SCZ, are related with alterations of PFC activity. Moreover, PFC activity during WM is predicted by midbrain dopamine, striatal dopamine and by reductions of amphetamine-induced release of prefrontal dopamine binding to D2 receptors in SCZ. Critically, research by the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium (PGC) supported the notion that the DRD2 gene coding for the D2 dopaminergic receptor is associated with risk for SCZ. DRD2 is not only related to SCZ risk, but genetic variation within this gene has been linked with phenotypes related to SCZ and its treatment. Consistent with studies showing that D2 dopaminergic receptors are involved in WM, functional genetic variants in DRD2 have also been associated with WM performance and related cortical activity in healthy subjects and in patients with SCZ. For example, a non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of DRD2, rs1076560, modulates alternative splicing of the D2 dopaminergic receptor transcript into two major isoforms (D2 long, D2L, and D2 short, D2S), likely affecting neuronal activity.

We focused on D2L in the PFC because it is mainly found at the post-synaptic terminal, its expression is altered in the PFC of patients with SCZ, and we were interested in the modulation of activity of neuronal populations receiving dopaminergic afferents during WM, a mechanism that is altered in SCZ. Furthermore, D2L is targeted by antipsychotic medications. To achieve our aim, we performed four consecutive steps (Figure 1). First, we identified the co-expression gene set of D2L from human post-mortem PFC. Second, we identified the association of independent genetic variants of the genes included in the gene set with expression of the whole gene set. Third, we combined these genetic variants into a Polygenic Co-expression Index (PCI) designed to index the genetic component of gene transcription co-regulation and validated this index in an independent post-mortem data set. Fourth, we associated our PCI with brain activity and behavioral performance during WM, that is, D2L-dependent and key intermediate phenotypes for SCZ, and response to treatment with antipsychotics which target D2 signaling in SCZ. Based on prior evidence, we hypothesized that genetic variants associated with greater co-expression of D2L and its gene set would also be associated with greater BOLD signal in the PFC during WM and poorer behavioral performance. In patients with SCZ, we investigated the preservation of the PCI\u2013BOLD signal relationships and assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the PCI as predictor of treatment outcome.

The heritability of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is extremely variable and appears to be comparable between cis- and trans-eQTLs (co-eQTLs fall in the latter category). Nevertheless, there is evidence of high replicability of eQTLs both with stringent and more lenient thresholds of significance.

Together, these validation steps and the findings obtained in multiple independent data sets across multiple biological scales support the idea that the SNPs identified here are valid and modulate the D2L co-expression pathway.

However, the first-ranked SNP, which even survived Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, is intergenic between two paralog genes, CHIT1 and CHI3L1. Both genes code for stress-induced chitinases and prior evidence associated brain CHI3L1 expression with SCZ. Genetic variants in this intergenic region such as rs4950928 have been associated with SCZ. This SNP is located upstream of CHI3L1 where also rs2486064 is located (linkage disequilibrium: r2=0.35, D\u2032=1). This regulatory region likely interacts with specific transcription factors. CHI3L1 expression has been proposed to be relevant to SCZ because of its association with the AKT1\u2013GSK3\u03b2 pathway, which is also associated with the cyclic AMP-independent pathway of DRD2.

These findings suggest that increased expression of the D2L co-expression gene set predisposes to less efficient WM processing, a well-established intermediate risk-associated phenotype for SCZ. These results are also consistent with a large body of studies demonstrating that pharmacological manipulation of dopamine D2R is associated with WM performance and with prefrontal activity measured with BOLD fMRI. Critically, they are consistent with a recent study reporting that greater prefrontal D2 PET binding is positively correlated with prefrontal activity during WM. Finally, these findings are consistent with several reports from our group suggesting that the T allele of rs1076560, associated with greater D2L/D2S ratio compared with the G allele, is also associated with inefficient prefrontal activity during WM. The present findings extend this earlier work by showing that the co-expression gene set identified by our network analysis is associated with genetic background outside the DRD2 gene.
