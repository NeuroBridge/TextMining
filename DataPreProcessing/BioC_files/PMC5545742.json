As microRNA-137 is known to regulate the expression of ~1900 other genes, including several that are independently associated with schizophrenia, we tested whether this gene set was also associated with variation in cognitive performance. Our analysis was based on an empirically derived list of genes whose expression was altered by manipulation of MIR137 expression. This list was cross-referenced with genome-wide schizophrenia association data to construct individual polygenic scores. We then tested, in a sample of 808 patients and 192 controls, whether these risk scores were associated with altered performance on cognitive functions known to be affected in schizophrenia. A subgroup of healthy participants also underwent functional imaging during memory (n=108) and face processing tasks (n=83). Increased polygenic risk within the empirically derived miR-137 regulated gene score was associated with significantly lower performance on intelligence quotient, working memory and episodic memory. These effects were observed most clearly at a polygenic threshold of P=0.05, although significant results were observed at all three thresholds analyzed. This association was found independently for the gene set as a whole, excluding the schizophrenia-associated MIR137 SNP itself. Analysis of the spatial working memory fMRI task further suggested that increased risk score (thresholded at P=10\u22125) was significantly associated with increased activation of the right inferior occipital gyrus. In conclusion, these data are consistent with emerging evidence that MIR137 associated risk for schizophrenia may relate to its broader downstream genetic effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1942, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1955, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified significant associations between schizophrenia (SZ) and multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within or near to the microRNA-137 (MIR137) host gene on chromosome 1. In the most recent and largest SZ GWAS the SNP rs1702294, located intronically to MIR137, was identified as the second highest SZ-associated variant. This SNP is in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with MIR137 variants previously identified in smaller GWAS such as rs1622579 (r2=0.99) and rs1198588 (r2=0.8). In line with the proposed influence of microRNA-137 (miR-137) on proliferation, migration and maturation of neural cells, mechanisms important to the cognitive process, one of three intronic variants in high LD identified in this region (rs1625579) has been associated with a number of cognitively relevant phenotypes.

Modeling or quantifying this polygenic risk is therefore important, both for the broader illness phenotypes, and for specific illness dimensions related to functional outcomes, such as cognitive deficits. It is interesting to note that miR-137 is known or predicted to regulate hundreds of other genes, many of which are independently risk loci for SZ. In vitro studies have suggested that miR-137 targets include BDNF, ZNF804A, TCF4, and CACNA1C, variants that have been shown to impact on both cognitive performance and cortical activity by our own group and others. Because miR-137\u2019s downstream regulatory targets include loci that are independently associated with both SZ risk and with cognitive deficits, it is possible that miR-137\u2019s regulation of these genes may also contribute to SZ-associated deficits in cognition, in addition to the MIR137 loci\u2019s direct effects on cognition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4230, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the polygenic effects on cognition of variants within genes that are downstream targets of miR-137.

This was carried out in order to elucidate pathways through which genetic disruption of miR-137 may increase SZ susceptibility. As disturbances in cognition are a cardinal feature of SZ, we investigated whether polygenic risk in this gene set explained variation in neuropsychological performance in patients and healthy participants. A key goal for this analysis was to estimate whether the variance explained by this downstream polygenic burden was independent to that explained by the single most robustly associated MIR137 SNP, rs1702294.

It is still unclear what the best approach to selecting thresholds is. The original PGC analysis reported 10 risk thresholds. We have included three to reduce the multiple testing burden, while others have reduced this burden even further by including only one, for example, a threshold of P=0.5. However, for our cognitive analysis the threshold considered would appear to have been unimportant: broadly the same cognitive associations were observed for each of the three thresholds considered. This would suggest that in fact a study of only one threshold would have been sufficient to characterize the cognitive consequences of this gene set. For the neuroimaging study, an association between MIR137 polygenic risk and cortical activation during a working memory task was only significant at the most conservative threshold of P=10\u22125; why this might have been case is uncertain. One possibility is that this was simply a false-positive finding; the fact that only a subsample of participants were included in this analysis, albeit relatively large for fMRI studies (n=108) might support this conclusion. Other explanations include that imaging findings may be more sensitive to the signal to noise ratio inherent in high polygenic risk thresholds (that is, that more lenient thresholds harbor a greater percentage of variants not robustly associated with risk, hence making them less informative). To our knowledge, only one other polygenic fMRI study has been carried out to date, and as noted included only one threshold.

However, symptoms in SZ and cognitive deficits occur along a spectrum, so despite the lack of patient fMRI data, our current analysis does allow for investigation of the association between this polygene score and functional alterations in healthy participant endophenotypes. In addition, a recent paper evaluating the effect of MIR137 on gray matter concentration found that the effects of SNPs in MIR137 and associated pathways have greater impact on brain structure and function in SZ patients than healthy participants. The results of the present analysis of healthy participants may be indicative of a greater impact in a patient population. Another potential limitation here is using a gene list derived from human progenitor neural cells, in which the stability of transcriptional regulation can change over time. Nonetheless, at least some of the genetic variants identified to generate the polygenic score are present in both adult and embryonic stages, so the effect of the variant may have already had its substantial influence in neurodevelopmental stages. With regard to the effect of medication on cognition, medication dosage was not used as a covariate in our whole sample analysis, which included controls, as doing so would have limited our sample size in the analysis (n=1000) to patients with this information (n=585).

As with other gene sets and putative biological pathways, discrepancies exist between genes that are bioinformatically predicted to be related, and those that have been empirically identified. For the MIR137 polygene scores generated here, we included only empirically derived genes. Gene expression changes in this study were found to significantly correlate with those following miR-137 manipulation in another human neural progenitor cell line in the subsequent study. Several lines of evidence suggest that at least part of the risk for SZ conferred by genetic variation at the MIR137 locus is via effects of miR-137 perturbation on the expression of other SZ susceptibility genes. Thus, variants within this empirically derived miR-137 regulated gene score that contribute to SZ polygenic risk may be hypothesized to impact upon cognitive function that is a central feature of the disorder. This study, by charactering the cumulative polygenic effects of these downstream risk variants while excluding the effects of risk variants with the miR-137 gene itself supports this hypothesis, both at a cognitive and at a cortical level. Functional studies indicate that miR-137 is involved in proliferation, migration and maturation of neural cells, likely to be the mechanisms behind this involvement with the cognitive process. Further studies of the effects of MIR137 polygene scores may benefit from adopting a more fine-grained approach to the selection of SNPs. This could include parsing the effects on cognition of those variants in this network that are directly versus indirectly influenced by MIR137, given that both are likely to have been included in the gene set.
