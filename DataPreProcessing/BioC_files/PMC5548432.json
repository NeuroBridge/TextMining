The aim of the current study is to make a preliminary attempt to relate changes in functional neural activity from beginning-of-treatment- to post-treatment to engagement with different components of treatment for cocaine use.

Combining several such treatments is widely accepted to improve clinical outcomes. For example, CBT, CM and disulfiram have each demonstrated enhancements in treatment efficacy relative to standard care alone, behavioral treatment controls, or placebo conditions in randomized clinical trials, and are thought to have complementary strengths and mechanisms. Specifically, CBT promotes abstinence by enhancing behavioral and cognitive coping skills as well as functional analyses of factors that contribute to continued drug use. A strength of CBT is its durability (i.e., persistent efficacy after treatment ceases), perhaps due to the focus on skill-building and greater cognitive-control over craving and drug-use behaviors. CM\u2019s strengths and limitations are complementary to CBT\u2019s. CM promotes treatment adherence and abstinence initiation by reinforcing target behaviors (e.g., treatment attendance, medication administration, cocaine abstinence) with money or prizes. As such, CM is a useful adjunct to enhance treatment adherence as well as initiate abstinence. However, CM\u2019s effects tend to weaken to some extent after the reinforcement schedule has ended. While no pharmacotherapies have FDA-indication for the treatment of cocaine-use disorder, disulfiram has shown promise in some trials. Although the mechanism underlying improved cocaine-use outcomes with disulfiram is unknown, several potential mechanisms have been proposed such as increasing plasma levels of dopamine by slowing the conversion of dopamine into noradrenaline via disulfiram\u2019s inhibition of dopamine- \u03b2-hydroxylase (D\u03b2H), reducing alcohol-precipitated relapses by inducing aversive responses to alcohol and altering cocaine\u2019s subjective reinforcing effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4551, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One step towards investigating neurocognitive mechanisms of treatments for cocaine use could be to incorporate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures into clinical trials for CUD. The specific fMRI task chosen should tap a specific cognitive domain, such as cognitive control, related to CUD. Disrupted cognitive-control has been proposed to contribute to initiation and maintenance of CUD through poor attentional control, attentional biases towards drug-related stimuli, impaired response inhibition, and reduced ability to regulate craving. However, the pattern of drug-induced alterations in cognitive-control-related-activity in SUDs is somewhat complex. Specifically, individuals with stimulant-use disorders differ from non-substance-using individuals on task-related functional activity in a manner that is task- and process-specific; that is, the direction of difference (hypo- versus hyper-activation) and affected anatomical regions vary by task (for review). For example, cognitive-control-related neural activity differs between active cocaine users and healthy comparison groups. Two separate studies comparing short-term abstinent (\u226472 hrs.) cocaine users with healthy controls showed relatively decreased activity in cocaine users (N=15) in anterior cingulate and right prefrontal regions and relatively increased activity in cerebellar regions while performing a go/no-go task with a working memory component, while cocaine users (N=13) performed worse on a go/no-go task and showed relatively lower activity in the anterior cingulate and right insula during successful stops and greater recruitment of medial frontal gyrus, left insula and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during errors. Individuals with CUD (N=14) with confirmed short-term abstinence (>72 hrs.), performing a multi-sensory Stroop task, showed greater recruitment of left dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC (dlPFC, vlPFC) and bilateral basal ganglia and less deactivation of bilateral ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), relative to non-users (N=16).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6594, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition, cognitive-control-related neural activity has been shown to be altered by acute cocaine administration (e.g.,) and may vary across abstinence duration (e.g.,).

Taken together, these findings highlight the sensitivity of cognitive-control-related neural activity to CUD, cocaine use, and cocaine abstinence, but also illustrate the complexity of interpreting findings.

For example, Color-Word-Stroop-related activity in CUD individuals (N=20) initiating a range of treatments (sample combined from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs)) was associated with treatment outcome, such that greater pre-treatment Stroop-related activity in the vmPFC, left posterior cingulate cortex and right striatum correlated with longer duration of continuous abstinence during treatment. In addition, higher pre-treatment Stroop-related activity in the striatum correlated with higher percent of drug-free urines during treatment, and lower pre-treatment Stroop-related activity in the dlPFC correlated with longer treatment retention. In another study, males with cannabis use disorder (N=20) scanned prior to CBT and/or CM treatment showed diminished Stroop-related activity in regions including dlPFC and ventral striatum relative to non-users (N=20). Furthermore, higher pre-treatment Stroop-related activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventral striatum was associated with less cannabis use during treatment and 1-year follow-up, respectively. In individuals with CUD assessed at the beginning of inpatient detoxification treatment, higher right dorsal ACC activity during an attentional bias task (Drug Stroop; N=34;) and lower error-related negativity (an electrophysiological measure of cognitive control; N=49;) were each associated with more cocaine use at 3-month follow-up.

However, exploratory analyses within the ROIs showing significant Stroop-related change across treatment suggested associations between greater reductions in Stroop-related activity (in left middle temporal gyrus and right MFG ROIs) and more exposure to CBT sessions (Supplemental Materials in). In another study in CUD, increases in Drug-Stroop-related activity (a measure of attentional bias to drug stimuli) in the midbrain from baseline to 6-month follow-up (N=15) was associated with fewer choices to view cocaine-related stimuli at follow-up; however, since subjects were recruited from a range of treatment programs, the relative contribution of differential treatment components or types were not assessed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10689, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Studies that have linked functional changes in stimulant users with specific pharmacotherapy have included laboratory one-day trials of the medication, rather than full clinical courses. For example, changes in Color-Word-Stroop-related activity were observed following administration of a single dose of methylphenidate (versus placebo). In individuals with CUDs (N=16) and non-users (N=15), methylphenidate reduced Stroop-related activity in dorsal ACC and also reduced activity in dlPFC in the CUD group only. Individuals with methamphetamine use disorders (N=15) exhibited increased Stroop-related activity, including in dlPFC, parietal and occipital regions relative to non-users (N=18), and methylphenidate further increased already hyperactive (relative to controls) Stroop-related activity in dlPFC, but reduced activity in parietal and occipital regions. These findings suggest that the impact of treatment on Stroop-related activity may vary across different substance using and healthy comparison groups. Taken together the existing research supports the clinical relevance of cognitive-control-related functional activity by demonstrating its associations with treatment outcome and ability to change in response to treatment for SUDs. Focusing on changes over the treatment course that relate to exposure to components of specific treatments is a novel approach to understanding mechanisms of action. This is important because effective therapies are hypothesized to change substance use by first changing brain-based cognitive processes related to substance use, including cognitive control. Prior work has demonstrated the efficacies of CBT, CM, disulfiram or combinations of these treatments on reducing cocaine use in some individuals.

The Color-Word Stroop color-word task, a measure of cognitive control, was chosen based on the proposed centrality of this cognitive construct to SUDs and abstinence. Data were drawn from participants in an RCT, all of whom received CBT as a platform treatment. Participants were also randomized to CM vs. no-CM and to disulfiram vs. placebo. The primary goal of the analyses was to identify how exposure to components of treatment was associated with changes in cognitive-control-related brain activity across treatment. First, we used a whole-brain analysis to assessed how Stroop-related brain activity changed at post-treatment versus beginning-of-treatment in the sample overall. Second, we used separate whole brain correlation analyses to assess how changes in Stroop-related brain activity at post-treatment versus beginning-of-treatment related to specific treatment components (number of CBT sessions, CM prizes or days of disulfiram medication) and cocaine-use measures (percent days cocaine abstinence during treatment; percent cocaine-negative urines during treatment). Based on our prior work reviewed above in a mixed substance-using sample receiving CBT or treatment as usual which showed reduced Stroop-related activity at post- relative to pre-treatment in the thalamus, midbrain, subthalamic nucleus, IFG, MFG and ACC, we hypothesized that patients would show diminished Stroop-related brain activity at post-treatment relative to beginning-of-treatment in these regions. We hypothesized that greater reductions in Stroop-related activity would be observed in association with exposure to active ingredients of each treatment type as operationalized by process indicators as follows (see Table 1): (1) exposure to CBT skills training (CBT sessions attended), (2) access to reinforcement through CM (CM prizes drawn for abstinence or adherence to medication) and (3) exposure to disulfiram (total days of medication doses taken). Finally, we hypothesized, based on the structure and goals of the respective treatments, that CBT engagement specifically would be associated with greater efficiency (as indicated by lower Stroop-related activity at post-treatment vs. beginning-of-treatment) in regions associated with \u2018top-down\u2019 regulatory control (e.g., ACC, IFG, MFG), and that CM engagement (i.e., randomization to CM group; more CM prizes drawn) would be associated with greater efficiency in regions which are involved in \u2018bottom-up\u2019 circuitry (i.e., regions implicated in reward-processing and valuation, including striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) which are also engaged by Stroop and other cognitive-control tasks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15654, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Materials and Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15676, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Participants", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15689, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Treatment-seeking participants were recruited to the fMRI study prior to treatment randomization in an RCT for CUD.

For example, acute intravenous administration of cocaine prior to Go/No-Go increased fMRI task-related neural activity in a manner that partially \u2018normalized\u2019 functional activity in active cocaine users. More specifically, following intravenous injection of cocaine (relative to intravenous saline) active cocaine users had higher successful-inhibition-related activity in right insula/IFG and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and higher error-related activity in right posterior cingulate/lingual gyrus, culmen of vermis/left lingual gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and right middle frontal gyrus, and decreased activity in left posterior cingulate on a Go/No-Go task. When compared with healthy participants from a prior study and using the same ROIs that had previously shown reduced activity in cocaine users, the findings were replicated in this group of cocaine users on saline indicating that cocaine users showed Go/No-Go-related hypo-activation following IV saline, relative to healthy controls, and that IV cocaine increased task-related activity in overlapping regions and abolished the significant hypoactive differences (relative to healthy controls). Furthermore, response-inhibition-related activity is altered non-uniformly throughout abstinence and prior findings from cross-sectional studies remain somewhat mixed. For example, in a cross-sectional study comparing healthy non-users, shorter-term abstinent (1\u20135weeks) and longer-term abstinent (40\u2013120 weeks) cocaine users, fMRI Go/No-Go task-related activity differed across groups in several brain regions. However, longer duration of abstinence was not necessarily associated with a change towards normalization (i.e., becoming closer to the healthy control group); rather, neural activity in some regions was more \u2018abnormal\u2019 in the longer-term abstinence group, which might reflect compensation. Furthermore, one study found no statistically significant group differences in fMRI Go/No-Go between healthy controls (N=45) and cocaine-abstinent individuals (average abstinence 32.3 weeks; range <1 \u2212100 weeks) who were recruited from intensive inpatient treatment for cocaine-use disorder (N=27). In contrast, a separate Go/No-Go fMRI study found no group differences during successful inhibitions, but during commission errors found that both current (N=30) and former cocaine users (N=29; average duration of abstinence 51.2 weeks) differed from healthy controls (N=35), with former cocaine users showing differences from healthy controls in more a priori regions of interest than current cocaine users.

For example, modafinil further increased hyperactive task-related functional activity in the ACC in cocaine users, relative to non-substance-using comparisons, and this increased activity was associated with diminished cocaine-craving. Furthermore, duration of abstinence is not necessarily associated with a change towards normalization (i.e., becoming closer to the healthy control group). , This may reflect the complex interplay between pre-existing vulnerabilities and drug-induced neuroadaptation in substance users. Namely, pre-morbid functional abnormalities may confer vulnerability to SUDs and drugs may have acute and prolonged effects on brain function, and some drug-induced abnormalities may persist through prolonged abstinence. Therefore, abstinence may not return individuals to pre-substance-use-disorder baselines, and pre-morbid baselines may be suboptimal treatment targets as they may not represent \u2018normalizations\u2019 of functional activity relative to healthy non-drug-users with low SUD-vulnerability (see for review of changes with substance-use onset and predictors of treatment outcome). These complexities underline the limits of using healthy case-comparisons to derive treatment targets and reinforce the importance of testing treatment-related change within substance abusers and relating these changes to treatment mechanisms.

In addition, only a subset of RCT participants participated in the optional fMRI component of the RCT. This limitation is mitigated by matching of groups on important baseline variables in the RCT and fMRI samples. Although the RCT included a full-factorial design, fMRI subgroup sample sizes prohibited analysis of CM-by-disulfiram or sex/gender-by-treatment type interactions.

The current study focused on cognitive-control-related brain function and was therefore only sensitive to treatment-related changes associated with this construct. Future research should investigate relationship between treatment components and non-cognitive-control-related mechanisms, using tasks tapping other cognitive constructs with relevance to SUDs (e.g., reward sensitivity, craving).

Our approach to these analyses may also prove a step forward in utilizing fMRI to understand how empirically-validated therapies may exert their effects.
