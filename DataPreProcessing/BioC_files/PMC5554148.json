Brain signals measured by neuroimaging techniques reflect the collective activities of populations of neurons with different rhythms. Because the rhythm of neurons can be periodic, chaotic, or random, brain signals would show different levels of complexity, which has been demonstrated by entropy analysis of blood oxygenation level\u2013dependent (BOLD) signals. Recently, neuroimaging studies have begun to reveal the dynamic reconfiguration of brain functional architecture using dynamic functional connectivity (i.e., time-varying correlations in BOLD signals between distinct brain regions across different time windows) and to demonstrate its relevance to cognitive functions and diseases. As the complexity within the BOLD signal varies across different brain regions, we expect to see a distribution of the complexity within the dynamic functional connectivity of different brain regions. However, the complexity within the dynamic functional connectivity has yet to be quantitatively characterized.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2144, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Apart from complexity, several methods have been proposed to measure different aspects of dynamic functional connectivity. For example, patterns of the functional connectivity were clustered into distinct classes, and the functional reconfiguration among these classes was modeled as a Markov chain. To characterize the temporal variability of a brain region, resting-state BOLD signals were segmented into nonoverlapping windows and the functional connectivity patterns of this region were compared among these windows. These methods, however, cannot estimate the complexity within the dynamic functional connectivity (see the supplementary information). Entropy is a well-defined statistical concept used to measure the complexity within dynamic processes, with larger entropy corresponding to greater complexity. Given the limited number of sampling points in an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, the classical estimations of the entropy are inaccurate. Sample entropy (SampEn) can overcome this drawback and has been used commonly in entropy analysis of fMRI data.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3236, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As a universal and secular phenomenon, the aging process has been suggested to be a progressive loss of complexity within the dynamics of physiologic outputs.

Previous studies have shown that the complexity within the temporal dynamics of brain signals measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and BOLD fMRI appears to decrease.

This may cause potential problems in many measures characterizing dynamic properties of the dynamic functional connectivity, especially when these confounding processes are periodic, because a periodic signal is considered to be variable regardless of its amplitude. Unlike these previous studies, we analyzed SampEn of the dynamic functional connectivity. According to the physical interpretation of SampEn, larger SampEn corresponds to greater irregularity in the dynamic functional connectivity.

In contrast, we observed that sensorimotor and visual areas show low SampEn.

With advancing age, the complexity within the temporal dynamics of brain signals measured by EEG, MEG, and BOLD fMRI appears to decrease. Consistently, we found that SampEn of the dynamic brain also decreases with advancing age. These decreases may relate to the decline in capacity of learning and memory with normal aging that is caused by alterations in neuronal structure and losses of synapses. Moreover, we identified that the reduction in SampEn of the dynamic brain is driven mainly by the amygdala-cortical functional connectivity. The amygdala-cortical connectivity has been reported to be age-related in both structural and functional neuroimaging studies, but the current study revealed the negative association between SampEn of the amygdala-cortical functional connectivity and age.

A most recent study reported that the subcortical-cortical resting-state functional connectivity decreases with advancing age in the general population, and this age-related decrease is insignificant in patients with autism. These results suggest that the normal aging process is altered by mental disorders. In the current study, we found a similar deviation from the normal aging process as the association between SampEn and age significantly decreases in patients with schizophrenia. Interestingly, the most significant deviation was identified in SampEn of functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the right superior orbital frontal cortex. This is consistent with a previous study that reported the association between the decreased amygdala-frontal functional connectivity and emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, we found that SampEn of the functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the right superior orbital frontal gyrus is lower in healthy elderly subjects compared with healthy young subjects, and is also lower in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy subjects (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3).

The interpretation of findings in the present study, however, needs to consider some limitations. Because noise also shows high SampEn according to the physical interpretation of SampEn, the observational noise in BOLD signals may contribute to SampEn of the dynamic functional connectivity. In the current study, we have associated SampEn with age, which suggests that the contribution of the observational noise to SampEn is not significant.
