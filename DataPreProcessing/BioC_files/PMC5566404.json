One current hypothesis, the interhemispheric miscommunication theory, is based on findings from fMRI, DTI and EEG, but there is only limited evidence so far concerning underlying functional coupling mechanisms. Here we report a 64-channel EEG study using lagged phase synchronization analysis and eLORETA source estimation to examine the functional connectivity between bilateral auditory cortices in the gamma-band in 26 schizophrenia patients (13 with and 13 without AVH) and 26 matched healthy controls (HC) while performing a dichotic listening task. We found a significantly reduced right-ear-advantage (REA) in AVH but not in non-AVH patients compared to HC. The major finding was significantly stronger gamma-band connectivity between bilateral auditory cortices during conscious perception of left (versus right) ear syllables in patients with AVH compared to HC and patients without AVH. A significant positive correlation was found between this connectivity alteration and the AVH symptom score in schizophrenia patients. These findings provide further support for the interhemispheric miscommunication hypothesis of AVH pathophysiology by indicating that aberrant gamma-band coupling between auditory cortices is related to the emergence of AVH in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1538, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1551, "infons": {"file": "41598_2017_9253_Fig1_HTML.jpg", "id": "Fig1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Schematic illustration of the DL procedure.

The fact that there is a substantial similarity between AVH and real voices has led researchers to suggest that \u201chearing voices\u201d are likely to emerge in the context of alterations in a brain network related to speech and language processing. One of the strongest and most often replicated findings for altered speech processing on a behavioral level in hallucinating patients is the disappearance of the right-ear-advantage (REA) during dichotic listening (DL). The DL task is the most frequently used behavioral indicator of language lateralization and typically consists of the presentation of two different verbal stimuli (such as consonant-vowel syllables) at the same time, one to each ear (Fig.\u00a01). Instructed to report the stimulus that is perceived best, healthy right-handed participants more often report the right than the left stimulus, a finding attributed to the supremacy of the contralateral pathways running from the right to the speech-dominant left hemisphere. In contrast, the left ear input initially accesses the right hemisphere and needs additional transfer via interhemispheric pathways before it is processed in the left hemisphere. 95% of right-handers show the typical left-hemispheric language dominance indicating a close link between language lateralization and handedness, and although no mutual genetic factors have been found so far, the two traits show partial pleiotropy.

For instance, it has been shown that there is striking interindividual variability in the size and shape of interhemispheric pathways in the general population, with stronger pathways improving transcallosal transfer so that individuals reported more stimuli presented to the left ear. Notably, two initial DTI studies demonstrated that the emergence of AVH was associated with stronger interhemispheric auditory pathways in early stages of SCZ, while opposite results were found in chronic SCZ. These findings suggest that the structural interhemispheric connectivity may evolve progressively and appear to be associated with patients\u2019 duration of illness. Furthermore, evidence of our own group indicated that Gamma-band Oscillations (GBO) and their synchronization are a key functional mechanism in the transcallosal auditory transfer and play a major role for conscious auditory perception of syllables presented to the left ear. Here, stronger interhemispheric gamma-band coupling between both auditory cortices was associated with a smaller REA. Accordingly, a reduced REA in AVH patients would be in line with stronger interhemispheric gamma-band connectivity. To date, not much is known about alterations in the functional connectivity involved in language processing and AVH, although GBO and their synchronization are a strong candidate given their specific role for perception processes in general and the growing literature about alterations of GBO in SCZ. While these GBO alterations appear to be complex, an increasing number of studies have reported that particularly positive symptoms of SCZ are correlated with altered oscillatory gamma synchrony in circumscribed sensory brain areas. Of interest, one EEG study reported a significant positive correlation between AVH symptom score and interhemispheric gamma-band coupling between primary auditory cortices during an auditory-steady-state-response (ASSR) task, although the ASSR task is not specifically designed to investigate interhemispheric interaction. In contrast, the DL task used in this study is perfectly suited to investigate interhemispheric (mis-)communication, altered auditory perception, and interhemispheric gamma-band coupling in relation to the emergence of AVH, as evidence of our own group indicated that synchronized GBO are crucially involved in transcallosal auditory information transfer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6464, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Hence, based on multimodal evidence from fMRI, DTI and EEG, the interhemispheric miscommunication hypothesis of AVH proposes that altered interhemispheric connectivity between bilateral auditory cortices is related to the emergence of AVH in SCZ. It is widely acknowledged that interhemispheric integration of information is crucial for normal speech processing and comprehension, so that disturbances could give rise to aberrant processing in an auditory network, which might lead to the experience of AVH. In the context of DL, previous studies have shown that stronger interhemispheric pathways as well as stronger gamma-band coupling between bilateral auditory cortices were both associated with a smaller REA. Consequently, the typical reduction of the REA in AVH patients could be best explained by stronger interhemispheric gamma-band coupling, given that GBO are known to be critically involved in cortical circuity abnormalities in SCZ. Thus, we expected specifically in AVH patients (1) an altered language lateralization that becomes apparent as reduced REA, and (2) a stronger interhemispheric gamma-band coupling between bilateral auditory cortices.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7627, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations":

In fact, the patient subgroups of this study differed significantly only in terms of PANSS positive subscore including the P3 hallucination item.

The main finding of this study supports the latter by demonstrating that AVH patients show a greater gamma-band phase synchrony difference between LE and RE syllables, thus stronger interhemispheric connectivity around 600 ms post-stimulus between left and right auditory cortices. This finding nicely extends our previous work of HC indicating that synchronized GBO are a key functional mechanism in the transcallosal auditory transfer and play a major role for conscious auditory perception of LE syllables. Neural GBO and their synchronization have been proposed in literature to be a fundamental mechanism that coordinates widely distributed neurons into dynamically formed functional networks, facilitating, for instance, coherent perceptions. If these dynamics are disrupted, it is suggested that pathological states emerge that lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as AVH. In accordance with that, we found a positive correlation between gamma synchrony and the PANSS hallucination item, indicating that a greater connectivity difference between left and right perceived syllables is associated particularly with more severe AVH. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that especially positive symptoms are correlated with increased oscillatory gamma synchrony in circumscribed sensory brain areas in the resting state, and during auditory or visual processing. For instance, it has been shown that phase locking of the 40-Hz auditory steady-state responses \u2013 which is generated in the PACs \u2013 was correlated positively with total positive symptoms in first-episode patients as well as with AVH symptoms in a sample of chronic SCZ patients. Also concordant with our finding, presence and subjective intensity of tinnitus \u2013 which is similar to AVH an auditory phantom percept \u2013 have been shown in MEG studies to be associated with increased GBO and their synchronization. Thus, former and our own observations suggest that the cortical areas involved in generating auditory phantom percept might be hyperconnected, a hypothesis that is compatible with heightened BOLD responses observed, for instance, during ongoing experience of AVH in the respective PACs. Accordingly, we found enhanced gamma-band phase synchrony between bilateral auditory cortices comprising both PACs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28484, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several reasons for altered ability to establish precise synchronization in the gamma-band between bilateral auditory cortices. These involve, for instance, the white matter properties of interhemispheric pathways that subserve phase synchronization. As mentioned above, previous studies using DTI revealed both stronger and decreased interhemispheric auditory pathways in patients with AVH, suggesting a progressive structural decline that might be associated with higher age and longer period of illness. In healthy people with AVH and patients with tinnitus, stronger interhemispheric connectivity has been observed, similar to early stages of SCZ. Furthermore, emerging evidence proposes a role of excitatory-to-inhibitory balance in maintaining stable perceptual representations, suggesting it may be a plausible model for hallucinations. Thus, the pattern of increased gamma-band coupling in AVH might be considered in terms of the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction hypothesis, given that ketamine \u2013 a NMDAR antagonist \u2013 has been found to elicit in HC both altered GBO as well as psychotic conditions very similar to the positive symptoms of SCZ, including AVH. Such NMDAR antagonists alter the excitation of parvalbumin-expressing, fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons, which are instrumental in the generation of GBO and are known to be disturbed in SCZ as is also the case for NMDAR function. Moreover, a recent MR spectroscopy study revealed significantly reduced glutamate levels in both auditory cortices in SCZ patients compared to HC, while increased levels were found for patients with frequent and severe AVH, relative to patients with less frequent and severe AVH. Thus, one hypothesis might be that AVH arise to some extent from aberrant oscillatory gamma synchrony that is associated with disturbed GABAergic transmission, NMDAR plasticity, glutamate level and hyperactivity in auditory cortices.

Moreover, there was no difference in chlorpromazine equivalents between AVH and non-AVH patients. It is known that altered GBO are also found in untreated patients with SCZ. In addition, EEG-based connectivity analysis has the advantage of measuring direct neuronal activity with an excellent temporal resolution in the millisecond-range (not possible with fMRI), so that the advanced analysis of LPS after source estimation provides an important estimate of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. The specific strength of this method is that confounding factors such as volume conduction effects are removed and only physiological connectivity information is thought to remain. Of course, one limitation is the relatively low spatial accuracy, although cross validation studies using simultaneous EEG and fMRI have suggested sufficient validity of the LORETA approach in general. It has been shown that the Euclidean distance between EEG- and fMRI-based localizations range between 1 and 2\u2009cm. Thus, our finding of increased gamma-band synchrony between both PAC and SAC (with no difference between ROIs) could be influenced by the low resolution of our source estimate approach.

Furthermore, our results indicate that altered interhemispheric gamma synchrony is specific to the occurrence of AVH, rather than to SCZ in general. Indeed the observed findings of altered GBO in SCZ patients are complex and suggest that important variables such as the specific symptom loading profile, condition (i.e., resting-state or specific cognitive demands), duration of illness, medication, and clinical status (first-episode, acute exacerbation, chronicity) might affect results and need to be considered in future studies. Moreover, an improved knowledge about GBO-generating mechanisms provides a useful basis for hypothesis-driven analysis of the pathophysiological origins of AVH that may eventually lead to novel insights and treatments. Finally, the implied relation between reduced LI, greater connectivity in favour of LE reports, and severity of AVH, which we observed in our data, suggests altered synchronized GBO as one underlying mechanism of dysfunctional auditory perception in AVH patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33462, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Electronic supplementary material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33496, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Electronic supplementary material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33530, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": " Supplementary information accompanies this paper at doi:10.1038/s41598-017-09253-7 ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33615, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": " Publisher's note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33753, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "title"}, "text": "Author Contributions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33774, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "S.S., G.L., C.M. designed the study; S.S. collected and analysed data; N.P. wrote codes; C.A. gave methodological and statistical support.
