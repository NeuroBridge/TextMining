Other changes to innate immune function caused by alcohol dependence include increased blood levels of peripheral immune signaling proteins such as cytokines. These observations provide clear evidence that alcohol dependence broadly alters the function of the peripheral immune system. Alcohol dependence also damages the brain, causing gray matter atrophy, neurodegeneration, and a variety of cognitive impairments. There may be an important link between brain changes and immune changes induced by alcohol dependence. The effects of alcohol on the neuroimmune system have been a topic of much recent preclinical research (see  for review).

Under normal conditions, microglia exist in a \u2018resting\u2019 state that is regulated closely by interactions with neurons. However, microglia become activated by signals indicating the presence of tissue damage or pathogens. This microglial activation is a key process in the initiation and maintenance of neuroinflammation. Although activated microglia serve necessary repair functions, excessive microglial activation may lead to the release of substances such as inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and glutamate that can cause neuronal dysfunction and death. The type of microglial activation depends in part on the type of molecular signal: pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tissue necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) lead to a pro-inflammatory phenotype which can contribute to neuronal loss, while exposure to anti-inflammatory cytokines induces a neuroprotective phenotype in microglia. Preclinical studies indicate that an initial alcohol binge activates microglia into a neuroprotective state. An initial activation may \u201cprime\u201d microglia for subsequent alcohol doses, resulting in a classically activated proinflammatory state. When this proinflammatory state becomes chronic, such as during a sustained alcohol binge, neurodegeneration and diminished neural function may occur.

Indeed, the finding of negative associations of brain levels of activated microglia with both reported drinks per day over the previous month and alcohol dependence severity imply a close connection between chronic alcohol use and microglial levels. Whether lower levels of activated microglia in brain contributed to or were merely a result of alcohol dependence is not known, however, this finding is consistent with the observation that individuals with alcohol dependence have increased susceptibility to liver disease, sepsis, and reduced host repair, possibly due to an inability to mount sufficient responses to inflammatory challenges.

Therefore observed [11C]PBR28 signal is generally attributed to levels of activated microglia. While this is a simple interpretation for increased TSPO levels, the data here indicating lower TSPO levels have a more difficult interpretation. TSPO expression is low in healthy brain, but specific [11C]PBR28 binding is still displaceable in normal humans. Thus some baseline level of TSPO expression is present in the healthy brain. Additionally, pharmacological interventions can deplete microglia levels in healthy rodents and reduce TSPO levels in humans, raising the possibility of a dynamic range in baseline microglial levels. Therefore, in this study we interpret lower TSPO levels as either diminished levels of activated microglia or possibly lower levels of TSPO in each cell.

One study imaging methamphetamine abusers with [11C]PK11195, a TSPO radiotracer less specific than [11C]PBR28, reported higher TSPO levels in midbrain, striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex compared to healthy controls, however, unconventional kinetic analysis methods limit interpretation of this work. In contrast, no differences in TSPO levels measured with [11C]PBR28 were reported between cocaine abusers and healthy controls. Thus the effects of substance use disorders on microglial activation may be drug specific. With this in mind, smoking status was an important consideration in this work, as 5 alcohol dependent subjects and 4 healthy controls were tobacco smokers. While there is evidence that nicotine itself may suppress microglial activation, tobacco smoke may lead to increased microglial activation. It is not known currently how tobacco smoking may affect brain TSPO levels in vivo, as human imaging studies of neuroinflammation in tobacco smoking have not been reported. Thus, potential effects of tobacco smoking on measured TSPO levels were controlled for by matching for smoking status in the two study groups.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28363, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The kinetic and statistical analysis methods of [11C]PBR28 PET data used here represent a major strength of this work. Recent studies using TSPO-specific PET imaging have reported outcome measures of regional radioactivity concentrations normalized to whole brain radioactivity levels. These approaches ignore the consensus use of VT as primary outcome measure for radioligands lacking a reference region that has been carefully validated to have no group differences in specific binding for a given pathology. Using normalized data severely limits the interpretation of whole brain normalization results to only test for differences in relative regional TSPO levels \u2013 effectively ignoring potential differences in absolute TSPO levels. Further drawbacks of this method have been detailed elsewhere. In addition, the use of VT/fP as an alternative primary outcome measure to VT was investigated, but statistical analysis with this outcome yielded no significant effect of rs6971 genotype (effect of diagnosis, F(1,26)=1367, p=0.253; effect of genotype, F(1,26)=4.098, p=0.054; interaction effect, F(1,26)=0.234, p=0.633). This finding provided evidence that the [11C]PBR28 fP measurement introduces excessive variability into the data, consistent with our center\u2019s previous report of increased test-retest variability with VT/fP as an outcome measure for [11C]PBR28 PET imaging. We contend that the analysis of PET data using conventional kinetic modeling techniques with full arterial sampling and metabolite analysis represents the most appropriate method for direct measurement of activated microglia levels in vivo.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29983, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The selection of regions of interest and corrections for possible gray matter atrophy were critical considerations to this work. Four large, non-adjacent regions of interest heavily implicated in the biology of alcohol neurodegeneration were selected for analysis. The frontal-striatal-cerebellar network and limbic system are brain regions affected the earliest and most severely in alcohol-related neurodegeneration, providing strong support motivating the selection of the a priori ROIs of frontal cortex, striatum, cerebellum, and hippocampus. This approach was chosen to provide some regional specificity without excessively increasing variance in the linear mixed model by introducing many regions of different sizes with different variance. For the interested reader, [11C]PBR28 VT values for additional brain regions, including whole brain average, are included in Supplementary Table 1. Notably, the 10% reduction in [11C]PBR28 VT for alcohol dependent patients compared to healthy controls is consistent across all regions. Additionally, a partial volume correction was implemented to adjust for possible individual differences in normalized gray matter volume. For the regions analyzed, alcohol dependent subjects exhibited 9.6\u00b120.8% less regional gray matter volume than healthy controls as estimated by our center\u2019s automated segmentation and registration techniques. These differences were greatest in frontal cortex and cerebellum, the regions most associated with tissue atrophy in alcohol dependence, thus we believe possible gray matter atrophy to be a critical consideration for this work. However, analysis of PET data without partial volume correction yielded a stronger main effect of diagnosis (F(1,26)=6.681) than the partial volume-corrected data (F(1,26)=4.983). We hypothesize that the partial volume correction likely introduced additional variability into the brain data, yet, this correction was considered critical to account for possible tissue atrophy in alcohol dependence. Therefore, partial volume-corrected [11C]PBR28 VT was reported as the preferred outcome measure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32088, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The cytokine response of peripheral monocytes to LPS stimulation was examined to complement measurements of TSPO brain levels. These data suggest that LPS stimulation of monocytes elicits a significantly less pro-inflammatory response in alcohol dependent subjects compared to healthy controls. Given the high variability in both sample groups and small sample size which likely precluded detection of significant differences, post-hoc analyses were conducted on these data, revealing significantly lower LPS-simulated cytokine response for IL-8 and IL-6 (see Figure 4A-B). Indeed, further assessment of the data indicates a pattern of lower pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 response in alcohol dependent subjects compared to healthy controls (see Fig. 4C). In contrast, the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine expression suggests an opposite pattern of greater response to LPS stimulation in alcohol dependent subject compared to healthy controls (Fig. 4E). The finding of lower pro-inflammatory response to LPS challenge in alcohol dependence is consistent with previous reports of lower LPS-stimulated response of IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 in alcohol dependent subjects. Interestingly, these previously reported findings were driven by significantly greater spontaneous (e.g. non-stimulated) cytokine levels in alcohol dependent subjects relative to controls, however, excessive experimental and physiological variability in this measurement limits the interpretation of this finding. Consistent with previous reports , no direct relationship between activated microglia levels in brain and cytokine measures was observed.
