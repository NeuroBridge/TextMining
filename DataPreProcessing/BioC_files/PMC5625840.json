While theory and evidence indicate that cortico-limbic neural dysfunction may account for deficits in goal directed behavior while experiencing distress, the neurobiological mechanisms of DT have yet to be examined. We modified a computerized DT task for use in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT-M), and examined the neural correlates and functional connectivity of DT among a cohort of substance users (n=21; regular cocaine and nicotine users) and healthy controls (n=25). In response to distress during the PASAT-M, we found greater activation in a priori cortico-limbic network ROIs, namely the right insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral medial frontal gyrus (MFG), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) significantly predicted higher DT among substance users, but not healthy controls. In addition, greater task-specific functional connectivity during distress between the right MFG and bilateral vmPFC/sgACC was associated with higher DT among substance users, but not healthy controls. The observed positive relationship between DT and neural activation in cortico-limbic structures, as well as functional connectivity between the rMFG and vmPFC/sgACC is in line with theory and research suggesting the importance of these structures for persisting in goal directed behavior while experiencing affective distress.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1786, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "INTRODUCTION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1799, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Affective distress, which includes feelings such as anxiety, stress, and irritability, is often present in addicted individuals during an abstinence attempt, with the severity of these symptoms reported to predict treatment outcome and relapse across drug classes.

These paradigms measure distress tolerance, defined as the ability to persist in goal directed behavior while experiencing affective distress. The distress tolerance laboratory paradigm involves participant engagement in and persistence on a task that gradually increases in difficulty, thereby increasing affective distress. The participant has the option to persist (for a mild incentive) or in contrast, to terminate the task, thereby escaping affective distress in the short-term but losing out on the reward in the long-term. In line with negative reinforcement models of drug use, low distress tolerance would be associated with a more rapid return to substance use in response to abstinence distress (i.e., to temporarily ameliorate the emotional discomfort). From this perspective, distress tolerance tasks effectively create a laboratory paradigm with high internal validity while creating a situation where affective distress during goal directed behavior and an opportunity for avoidance interact, allowing the participant to make the decision of persisting or terminating the task. Indeed, several findings converge to provide evidence of the utility of the distress tolerance paradigm in predicting substance use outcomes.

All participants demonstrated increased activation in motor planning and execution substrates (left precentral gyrus), as well as deactivation in areas associated with response inhibition and self-awareness (inferior frontal gyrus), working memory and emotion processing (middle frontal gyrus), recognition memory (precuneus), and reward anticipation (caudate). This is in line with task demands, as the increased speed of number presentations and forced failure would be expected to accompany the increased frequency of motor responding with the joystick, as well as decreased anticipation of reward. Critically, substance users demonstrated greater deactivations than controls in regions associated with response inhibition and action monitoring (juxtapositional lobule cortex), attentional reorientation (middle frontal gyrus), and recognition memory (precuneus). This may reflect greater challenges for substance users in activating neural regions responsible for detecting and responding to task demands in an ongoing manner while experiencing affective distress.

However, only among substance users did we observe regions of interest associated with distress tolerance, namely the right insula, ACC, right IFG, bilateral MFG, and right vmPFC. The positive association between distress tolerance and activation in the prefrontal cortex and ACC is in line with evidence indicating that emotion regulation processes depend upon these regions initiating inhibitory control, working memory, and goal directed behavior. As part of the salience network (SN), the right anterior insula plays a critical role in detecting and evaluating stimuli in order to engage task oriented responding, suggesting that reduced activation in the right insula may lead to less recruitment and engagement of prefrontal regions primarily responsible for cognitive control processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27502, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We also investigated whether task-related functional connectivity was associated with distress tolerance. An analysis of the psychophysiological interactions (PPI) using the right MFG as the seed region demonstrated a significant interaction between right MFG-vmPFC/sgACC connectivity and group in predicting distress tolerance, with follow-up analyses indicating that substance users with higher distress tolerance demonstrated greater functional connectivity during the distress phase of the task between the right MFG and vmPFC/sgACC. Both the subgenual ACC and vmPFC are associated with signaling emotional significance and goal valuation, while the MFG has an important role in emotion regulation via cognitive control in non-substance using, and substance dependent samples. Our finding is in line with theory suggesting impairment in the ability of substance users to exert emotion regulation and cognitive control in the face of distress via top down mechanisms. In particular, reported a positive correlation between perceived stress during an acute stressor prior to task onset, and functional connectivity between the dlPFC and vmPFC during successful self-control in a goal directed food choice task.

Although task effects indicated elevations in distress and engagement on the task, a clear ceiling effect is noteworthy, such that the majority of healthy control participants persisted on the task for the entire duration of the distress tolerance phase, limiting the within group variability in levels of distress tolerance. The healthy controls evidenced significantly less deactivation in the bilateral MFG and significantly greater activation in right IFG during distress, which was not observed in the substance users and may reflect a more effective cortico-limbic response to distress in healthy controls. Given evidence of task effects on distress, as well as the ceiling effect in levels of distress tolerance, it is premature to conclude that neural response to distress is unrelated to distress tolerance within a healthy population. Moreover, the ability to accurately characterize group differences is compromised.

Our sample included regular non-treatment seeking cocaine users who also reported daily cigarette use and use of additional substances on a weekly or less basis. In addition, our substance using sample was predominately male. As such, generalizability of our results is limited among treatment seeking substance users, females, and individuals who regularly use other substances. Low distress tolerance is associated with additional psychopathology and related constructs other than substance use disorder. It will be important for future work to rule out additional variables contributing to the current findings. Moreover, it will be important to determine if these findings extend to other DT assessment paradigms (see for a review) as well as to investigate whether neural response to distress on the behavioral paradigms is associated with self-report indices of DT. Given the existing literature indicating the utility of behavioral measures of DT in predicting post-treatment relapse, a next step will be to examine the utility of the neural indices of distress tolerance in predicting treatment response.
