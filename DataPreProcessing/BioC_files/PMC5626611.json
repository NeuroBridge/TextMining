A similar but less severe type of limited awareness can also occur in non-KS alcoholism and is observed as an impairment in generating Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK) predictions about future recognition performance. We previously found that FOK accuracy was selectively related to volumes of the insula in alcoholics involved in the present study. Unknown, however, are the neural substrates of unawareness of memory impairment in alcoholism. A task-activated fMRI paradigm served to identify neural nodes and networks implicated in inaccurate self-estimation of mnemonic ability in sober alcoholics while they made prospective FOK judgments in an episodic memory paradigm. Lower activation in the right insula correlated with greater overestimations of future memory abilities in alcoholics. Weaker connectivity of the right insula with the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a node of the salience network, and stronger connectivity of the right insula with the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a node of the default mode network (DMN), co-occurred in alcoholics relative to the controls. Specifically, alcoholics, who failed to desynchronize insula-vmPFC activity, had greater overestimation of their memory predictions and poorer recognition performance. This study provides novel support that deviant functional activation and connectivity involving the right insula, a hub of the salience network, appears to participate in disrupting metamemory functioning in alcoholics. Compromised FOK performance might result from disturbance of the switching mechanism between brain networks serving self-referential processes (i.e., DMN network) and networks serving externally-driven activities like memory monitoring (i.e., fronto-parietal network). Thus, compromise in insular network coupling could be a neural mechanism underlying anosognosia for subtle mnemonic impairment in nonamnesic alcoholism.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2216, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Abstinent alcoholics have been reported to make accurate judgments in retrospective confidence ratings of actual recognition performance (i.e., Retrospective Confidence Judgment, RCJ) but to be inaccurate in assessing future recognition performance for episodic information (i.e., Feeling-Of-Knowing judgments, FOK). Our previous studies have shown that alcoholics exhibited a tendency to overestimate their prediction of future episodic memory performance, believing themselves capable of accurately recognizing information when they subsequently failed to do so. We have assumed that this cognitive dissociation of intact RCJ with impaired FOK in uncomplicated alcoholism is consistent with a secondary mnemonic anosognosia. In other words, when alcoholics fail to consolidate newly updated information about their memory abilities into their semantic and autobiographical personal long-term knowledge database, they then compare their current memory functioning to outdated self-beliefs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4131, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The neural substrates of component mnemonic processes relevant to metamemory have been investigated in few other studies. Using an episodic FOK paradigm, a recent paper reported that structural integrity of the right insula supported memory awareness in a mixed group, which included patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and cognitively healthy older adults. Similarly, we found that FOK accuracy was selectively related to volumes of the insula in the uncomplicated alcoholics involved in the present study. Because the insula has been identified as a critical neural substrate of multiple components of self-awareness, we posited that prospective episodic FOK implicates online memory monitoring mechanisms and additional self-referential processes to generate accurate future estimations. Structural damage in the medial prefrontal cortex also plays a critical role in disturbing episodic FOK accuracy as demonstrated in patients with frontal brain damage. Further evidence provided by a functional neuroimaging study revealed that accuracy in episodic FOK predictions in healthy subjects may be supported by a multi-functional, left fronto-temporal brain network: the inferior prefrontal cortex for the creation of cues activating information in memory, the hippocampus and temporal cortex for storage and retrieval memory contents, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for ensuring the \u2018monitoring\u2019 of these retrieval processes in memory.

In the present study, we furthered this finding by showing that deviant activation patterns and functional connectivity with the right insula, a region known to support facets of self-awareness, emerged as a potential functional neural substrate of metamemory impairment in these recovering alcoholics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29406, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The alcoholic pattern of lower activation in the right insula associated with overestimation of future memory abilities supports our hypothesis that a compromised insula may be a critical brain substrate of FOK inaccuracy in alcoholism. This result is consistent with our previous observation, where poorer FOK accuracy selectively related to smaller insular volumes in uncomplicated alcoholics. Investigating the neural correlates of FOK using general knowledge questions, showed that greater activation in the bilateral anterior insula (AI)/inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) correlated with a stronger sense of feeling of knowing in healthy participants. Interestingly, the bilateral AI/IFG regions were not recruited during the successful recall processes, thereby supporting the assumption that these brain regions could be specifically involved in the metamemory processes, i.e., the feeling of knowing, but not in episodic memory retrieval process itself. This interpretation could also be applied to our study in the context of an episodic memory paradigm because no association was found between activation in the right insula and successful recognition performance in the alcoholics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30634, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Conversely, the control group displayed greater activations in the right cerebellum that were related to better episodic FOK accuracy and also to greater recognition performance. One aim of the present study was to investigate brain regions activated during an episodic FOK judgment and how these brain activations could contribute to subsequent recognition performance. The recognition part of our episodic memory task was assessed outside the scanner and not during the fMRI session. Thus we did not directly assess the brain regions activated during the recognition part of the episodic memory task, which could potentially explain why usual memory-related regions such as the hippocampus or other limbic structures were not activated. Rather, we sought activations of metamemory-related brain regions and explored those that could potentially participate in the subsequent recognition performance. In the controls, the pattern of activation suggests that the cerebellum could normally support cognitive processes common to both metacognitive and recognition mechanisms in episodic memory. The trace-access hypothesis has been proposed as a cognitive explanation of FOK judgment creation. When a person attempts to recall target information but fails to do so, his or her FOK judgment would depend on the partial recovery of the non-recalled target. Given the role played by the cerebellum in conscious retrieval processes in episodic memory and executive functioning, control participants with higher activation in the right cerebellum might demonstrate better ability in partial recovery of non-recalled words from memory that could enhance the feeling-of-knowing about the target and facilitate the subsequent recognition performance. Moreover, in the control group, better metamemory accuracy and also greater episodic memory performance were related to lower activations in the right superior frontal cortex. Given that the superior frontal cortices are known to be part of the Default Mode Network (DMN), particularly implicated in internally focused tasks such as autobiographical memory retrieval and self-reference activities, one potential explanation is that accurate episodic FOK and subsequent memory performance may be supported by a shift towards effortful executive processes used to monitor the ongoing memory activity and away from self-referential, DMN-like processes used to retrieve information from autobiographical (subjective) knowledge about past memory abilities. We speculate that the controls, unlike alcoholics, had already achieved this shift, which likely occurs through greater cerebellar involvement.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33271, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Functional connectivity studies have posited the insula to be a central node in the salience network, which is a large-scale system involving the anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Relevant to the present finding, the salience network was reported to play a pivotal role in initiating and enabling a dynamic switching between other large-scale networks, especially between the DMN, supporting self-referential mental activity, and the central executive (i.e. fronto-parietal) network, subserving attention and executive monitoring. During effortful cognitive tasks, the salience network as well as the fronto-parietal network reportedly showed increased activation, while the DMN showed decreased activation. Consistent with the hypothesis of a disconnection or an impaired switching mechanism between self-referential mechanisms and online memory monitoring processes in alcoholics, we observed that weaker connectivity of the right insula with the left dACC (i.e., in the salience network) and stronger connectivity of the right insula with the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (i.e., vmPFC, a node of the default mode network) co-occurred in alcoholics than the controls. Specifically, alcoholics, who failed to desynchronize insula-vmPFC activity, had greater overestimation of their memory predictions and poorer recognition performance. These functional connectivity patterns suggest that compromised uncoupling of insula-vmPFC activity could contribute to alcohol-related impairment in metamemory. Supporting our hypothesis of an impaired switching mechanism in alcoholics and using an arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging method, have proposed that attenuated insular cerebral blood flow was a mechanism underlying compromised connectivity among salience network nodes in recovering alcoholic men. This selective insular perfusion deficit could have the potential to impair alcoholics' ability to switch from self-referential processes to cognitive control processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35287, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given the implication of the insula in the integration and representation of ascending interoceptive and viscerosensory signals, this brain structure has been considered as a key node in the generation of subjective feelings that guide decision-making. Many recent studies have revealed that the insular cortex, especially anterior regions, plays a critical role in decision-making under conditions of uncertainty related to the inability to predict an outcome. Development of FOK judgments relies on generating predictions about future memory performance that relies on probability estimates rather than precise knowledge about the outcome (i.e., the actual memory performance). Therefore, this subjective assessment of one's knowledge regarding prospective memory abilities involves a cognitive component of decision-making under uncertainty. The low relative activity in the anterior insula of some alcoholics may prevent the feeling of uncertainty inherent in a feeling-of-knowing experience when uncertainty should but does not prevail. Consequently, it could compromise the processing and resolution of uncertainty by setting up more effortful executive processes useful to retrieve information about the actual episodic memory experience and to support the cognitive comparator mechanisms to enhance the detection of a memory failure. By default, alcoholics may base their memory predictions only on the subjective and affective self-referential information stored in their personal database [cf., ] rather than on an objective assessment based on online memory monitoring processes. However, according to our previous study conducted in the same group of alcoholics, the subjective representation of the alcoholics' actual memory functioning, i.e., their personal database, may not have been completely updated over time and would only reflect their memory skills at some time earlier in life, perhaps before or at the beginning of their alcoholism onset. Therefore, when the function of the insula is compromised, alcoholic patients may experience a greater subjective feeling of certainty when asked to predict their future memory performance and tend to overestimate their prospective memory abilities.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37501, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Limitations of these findings must be acknowledged with respect to the sex distribution, which precluded reliable testing of potential sex differences in brain activation patterns.

Furthermore, most of the alcoholic participants reported current or past dependence for tobacco. Chronic cigarette smoking represents a highly prevalent comorbidity in alcoholism and must be considered as a potential confounding variable given that chronic smoking can contribute to cognitive dysfunction in alcohol dependence.

Thus a decoupling compromise could contribute to anosognosia for mnemonic impairment in chronic, nonamnesic alcoholism.
