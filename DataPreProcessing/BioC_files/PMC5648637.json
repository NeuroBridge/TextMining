This is particularly true of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which were among the last major psychiatric diagnoses to be nosologically separated, with ASD accorded its own set of formal diagnostic criteria in DSM-III. Both are viewed as neurodevelopmental conditions with prominent impairments in social cognition, and falling on a spectrum that fades into a population variance in normal psychological traits. With a general consensus that disturbance of the social brain is a major feature of both disorders, the nature of this disturbance remains debatable and several distinct views on this can be discerned. Various authors describe this shared involvement of the social brain as coincidental (due to etiologically unrelated pathological processes in each disorder, encompassing partially overlapping structures of the brain) or epiphenomenal (primary in schizophrenia, but only secondary in ASD and stemming from an ontogenetically earlier disturbance in primary sensory processing). Still others consider the overlap to be predilect by selective evolutionary pressures, with each disorder representing an extreme case of a diametric trade-off in population variance for cognitive sets of social and nonsocial abilities. Neuroimaging techniques naturally lend themselves to exploration of the proposed models of the social brain and other impairments in schizophrenia and ASD as reflected in differential topological patterns and vectors of brain changes predicted by each model.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3604, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Two recent structural MRI studies, directly comparing subjects with schizophrenia and ASD, found opposite changes in both gray and white matter volumes in several brain regions in relation to healthy controls, consistent with the diametrical hypothesis of social brain involvement in each of the disorders. While volumetric analyses appear well-suited for elucidation of evolutionary and developmental impacts on related cerebral structures, functional imaging techniques may be used to delineate more proximate patterns of differential, task-induced activation. Indeed, two such fMRI studies of ASD and schizophrenia lend support to the diametrical hypothesis and another report implied a mere functional overlap. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, owing to the extended tracer uptake period, is uniquely positioned to evaluate between-group differences in more sustained task-dependent and basal metabolic patterns, thus occupying an intermediate space between structural and functional MRI. FDG-PET assessments of subjects with schizophrenia have consistently reported hypofrontality (especially in relation to negative symptoms), decreased metabolic rates in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions, as well as some thalamic nuclei (mediodorsal, pulvinar), lateralized changes in the temporal lobes, and increased metabolic rates in the basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, especially in relation to positive symptoms). Findings in ASD proved somewhat less consistent, generally pointing to diminished metabolic rates in the anterior cingulate, parietal cortex, basal ganglia (caudate, putamen), as well as increased metabolic rates in the occipital cortex. Only a single study directly compared subjects with schizophrenia and ASD during a continuous performance test, confirming decreased metabolism in the anterior cingulate and increased metabolism in the parietal regions in schizophrenia, as well as decreased metabolism in the medial thalamus in those with infantile autism. In the present study, we used FDG PET during a modified California Verbal Learning Test to directly compare cortical and subcortical glucose metabolic rates in subjects with schizophrenia and ASD in relation to healthy controls. Topological patterns and vectors of metabolic activity were examined in order to investigate the nature of a proposed relationship between schizophrenia and ASD with respect to the above-referenced theoretical models. Our previous morphometric assessment on a sample of subjects with ASD and schizophrenia, overlapping with the present cohort, revealed a diametric relationship among gray matter volumes in these diagnostic groups in relation to healthy controls, with invariably larger volumes in those with ASD.

For cortical analyses, metabolic rates for each of the 42 Brodmann areas were entered into an ANCOVA with repeated measures of hemisphere and Brodmann areas. Main effects of diagnosis, as well as higher-order group-by-hemisphere and group-by-Brodmann area interactions were assessed for hemispheric and localized intergroup differences in metabolic rates. These analyses of the whole cortex were followed by separate lobar analyses for constellations of Brodmann areas in each of the lobes, as well as the cingulate arch: 11 areas in the frontal lobe (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 44, 45, 46, 47), 12 areas in the temporal lobe (20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42), 8 areas in the parietal lobe (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 39, 40, 43), 3 areas in the occipital lobe (17, 18, 19), and 8 areas in the cingulate (23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33). In addition to univariate F, multivariate Wilks\u2019 \u03bb statistics were documented for all higher-order (i.e. other than main effects) interactions. We selected the use of repeated measures MANOVA as our strategy to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons since it reduced their number to a single group-by-Brodmann area interaction, with visual assessment of the graphed patterns. For reference in the future replication studies, we do, however, report significant F statistics for follow-up three-group ANCOVAs on each of the individual Brodmann areas that emerge as differential in the inspection of the graphed patterns. Similar analyses were used for comparisons of relevant subcortical structures, with evaluation of main effects of diagnosis for all of them and also diagnostic group-by-region interaction for subregions of the caudate. Age was used as a covariate due to significant age differences among three groups of participants (ANOVA F2, 118=3.47, p=0.034). We supplement these results (Tables 1 and 2) with ANOVAs without controlling for age as illustrated in Figures 1\u20134, because different age trajectories of ASD and schizophrenia may potentially render ANCOVA correction confounded. We report all 42 Brodmann areas and 16 subcortical structures to provide a systematic database (Table 1). Since earlier studies have tended to emphasize frontal, thalamic and striatal differences in subjects with schizophrenia and cingulate, parietal and cerebellar differences in ASD, a wide region of interest selection was important for the three-group analyses. Since a number of studies have reported multiple regions of significant differences in two-group analyses, we have reported uncorrected, Bonferroni corrected, and MANOVA repeated measures interactions to provide control of Type I and II error. We applied two strategies in correcting for multiple region testing and the problem of type I error. First, we entered the entire cortical dataset into an all-data ANOVA (42 Brodmann areas \u00d7 three diagnostic groups \u00d7 two hemispheres). If this was significant at the p<0.05 level, we then examined follow-up ANOVA for specific brain lobes considering main effect of group and group\u00d7Brodmann area interaction (two tests). However, since individual t-tests are most commonly reported in the literature we also examined follow-up group\u2013pair ANOVA and t-tests. For patients vs. healthy controls comparison we computed the Bonferroni correction based on the number of variables in the cortex and subcortical regions separately because published literature values have been reported for single structures and single hemispheres, typically in separate reports. An alternative was to compute the denominator based on the three-group comparison and the three two-group comparisons (variables\u00d74). However, this strategy could have been considered spuriously conservative since it would be associated with a false failure to replicate published findings. Therefore, we present all data both as p<0.05 as replication and Bonferroni corrected for multiple structures.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17291, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Results", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17299, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Subjects with ASD and schizophrenia vs. healthy controls", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17356, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on the three-group MANCOVA with repeated measures of hemisphere and Brodmann areas, comparing FDG metabolic rates across all 42 Brodmann areas in subjects with ASD, schizophrenia and healthy controls, there emerged a divergent pattern of greater-than-normal rates in those with schizophrenia and lower-than-normal rates in those with ASD in the precentral/postcentral region comprising areas 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 1).

Although still debated, motivational mechanisms and reward anticipation in the anterior cingulate and mirroring functions (empathy) of the motor and somatosensory cortices are often deemed relevant to social cognition and thus considered a part of the social brain. Medial portion of Brodmann area 9 may be relevant to reasoning, including social reasoning and mentalizing. In line with the diametrical hypothesis of, our present finding of higher-than-normal metabolic rates in the somatosensory and motor cortex in schizophrenia may underlie its position at the empathizing extreme of the systemizing-empathizing axis. The finding of higher-than-normal metabolic rates in the medial prefrontal cortex (area 9) in ASD may then underlie its position at the systemizing (over-reasoning) extreme. Another intriguing possibility may arise if the regions with diametrical changes in metabolic rates in subjects with ASD and schizophrenia are considered as a network. Indeed, recent meta-analyses of PET imaging studies of dimorphism in male and female sexual behaviors include premotor and supplementary motor areas in their cognitive component, primary and secondary somatosensory areas \u2013 in the emotional component, anterior cingulate and hypothalamus \u2013 in the motivational component. Of these, increased metabolic rates in the hypothalamus appear exclusively correlated with male sexual response. The extreme male brain theory of autism posits the systemizing\u2013empathizing axis of cognitive styles as a function of the dimensional distribution of psychological correlates of sexual dimorphism in population. Herein reported higher-than-normal metabolic rates in the hypothalamus in subjects with ASD, as predicted by the extreme male brain theory, would place them at the male brain extreme, and reverse would be true of those with schizophrenia.

In this latter region, volumes were greater-than-normal in ASD and lower-than-normal in schizophrenia, but metabolic rates were lower-than-normal in ASD and greater-than-normal in schizophrenia.
