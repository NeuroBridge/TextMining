In order to better understand potential differences in neurocognitive functioning among adolescents who use drugs, the current study aimed to identify the neural substrates of risky decision making that differ among adolescents who primary users of alcohol or marijuana, primary users of both alcohol and marijuana, and controls who report primary use of neither drug. Participants completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Comparison of brain activation during risky decisions versus non-risky decisions across all subjects revealed greater response to risky decisions in dorsal anterior cinguate cortex (dACC), anterior insula, ventral striatum, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Group comparisons across non-using controls, primary marijuana, primary alcohol, and alcohol and marijuana users revealed several notable differences in the recruitment of brain regions. Adolescents who use both alcohol and marijauna show decreased response during risky decision making compared to controls in insula, striatum, and thalamus, and reduced differentiation of increasing risk in dACC, insula, striatum, and superior parietal lobe compared to controls.

While recruitment of frontal-based cognitive control systems increases linearly throughout development, reward based systems follow a quadratic increase with the peak occuring during adolescence, resulting in an imbalance between the two systems during the critical age period when drug use increases. Studies have demonstrated reduced lateral frontal engagement during response inhibition among high-risk adolescents (i.e. those with a positive family history positive for substance use disorder) and among current alcohol/marijuana users compared to controls, as well as differential response in ventral striatal regions in current alcohol/marijuana users compared to non-using controls.

Blue balloons exploded after 5 pumps on average, pink balloons exploded after 8 pumps, and white balloons did not explode and were used as the control condition. Each balloon sequence began with a balloon on the screen. Participants were instructed to either pump or cashout by pressing a button with their index or middle finger, respectively. For blue and pink balloons, participants were instructed to pump until an explosion occurred or they decided to cash-out. Each decision to pump the balloon resulted in inflation over 200 milliseconds (msec), time during which participants could not make another pump response. During the pump, an inflation sound was played, the same sound used in the original BART. For each balloon, a predetermined number of pumps was selected from a Gaussian distribution with the average number of pumps as the mean and a standard deviation of one. The minimum number of pumps for each balloon was 2 for blue and 5 for pink, and the maximum number of pumps was 8 and 11. On explosion trials (i.e. those trials in which the number of pumps met the threshold for explosion), the balloon expanded for 50 msec, exploded on the screen with an accompaying explosion sound, and participants lost all points accumulated for the current balloon. At any time, participants were able to cashout instead of continuing to pump. Cashout responses resulted in an accumulation of the points earned on that balloon while the intact balloon remained on the screen; participants heard the sound of coins falling into a bank while the total number of points earned increased on the screen. Both explosion and cashout outcomes were displayed for 2 seconds. Between balloons, a blank screen appeared 2 to 16 seconds.

Thus, the assumed amplitude for the mean pump regressor was one, whereas the linear regressor had varying amplitudes according to the number of pumps on a given balloon sequence. Linear pump regressors were orthogonalized with respect to the mean pump regressor. Note that while prior studies have used a constant duration for all pumps (e.g.), this strategy was implemented in an event-related design, where each pump is modeled separately. In the current analysis approach, the entire pumping sequence for a given balloon is modeled as a block, and depending on how many pumps were chosen, the block length may differ from balloon to balloon. While we considered choosing a mean block length as the duration as in, we decided against this strategy because this duration would encompass both the pump decisions as well as the outcome on some proportion of the balloons, thus leading to an incorrect model of the events that occurred throughout the task. White balloons were modeled in the same manner as color balloons, with both a mean and linear regressor.

While the disparate results between these two studies may be attributable to numerous factors including sample or design differences, the sample used here was significantly younger than the Bogg et al. study. Studies continue to reflect that adolescents engage portions of the dACC/SMA to a lesser degree than adults, which could have driven observed outcomes with our adolescent sample. However, design differences may be a more salient difference; used an event related modeling approach that enabled the separation of each pump decision, whereas this study modeled each sequence of pumps as a single block. In addition, the current study used a consistent reward (i.e. 1 point), whereas Bogg et al. used increasing rewards for each pump.

If it is true that there are patterns of activation that underlie risk-taking more generally, then of importance for interpretation, these patterns are, in fact, matched in our groups, and thus any observed differences could be viewed as specific to substance use.

The field has been moving towards integration of basic biological metrics, including neuroimaging (MRI/fMRI) as indices of mechanisms of treatment response for adolescents, as well as increasing use of neuroimaging as a more sensitive metric to identify the nature of adolescent cognitive processing. While neuroimaging itself is unlikely to be a widely disseminated tool for day-to-day clinical settings, starting to understand how the adolescent brain processes risk information is critical to informing treatment development and tailoring of interventions so that they are more responsive and effective for this developmental phase. This is particularly critical at this time, when interventions for adolescent alcohol and cannabis use have much lower effect sizes for adolescents, as compared with adults. Concretely, brain-based differences may play a critical role in helping interventionists determine which factors to address and enhance within the context of intervention efforts. For example, results from the current study may suggest that it may be fruitful to target cognitive processes such as reward valuation or risk assessment in individuals who use alcohol+marijuana. The next step would be to examine the degree to which interventions that incorporate reward valuation and risk assessment (e.g., contingency management; cognitive behavioral therapy) change response in these regions, and whether those modulations of brain response predict subsequent reductions in adolescent drug use and/or risk taking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35405, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitations and Future Directions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35439, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While the current study has many strengths, some limitations must also be acknowledged. First, the groups differed in the use of hard drugs and proportion of males, both of which could have influenced group differences. However, when controlling for these variables, clusters showing group differences either increased in extent or decreased slightly, but remained significant suggesting that group differences were not driven solely by these variables. Next, abstinence from alcohol/marijuana at the time of scanning was confirmed using only self-report. Thus there is some possiblility that a portion of the group differences may have emerged from acute drug effects from past 24-hour use. Finally, the variant of the BART used in the current study had some limitations. First, we failed to observe any group differences in behavior on the BART, which may have been the result of the reduced range of pumps required to cause an explosion; this limited range may have placed artificial constraints on risk taking. In addition to a lack of group differences, the limited range of available pumps on color balloons caused participants to pump significantly less on color balloons than the control balloons, a difference that could contribute to group differences in BOLD response. However, examination of the percent signal change across regions that demonstrated group differences suggests that variation in BOLD reponse occurred primarily in the color balloon condition, suggesting our results are not merely the result of an imperfect control condition. Finally, we acknowledge that the variant of the BART used in the current study is limited in its ablity to parse specific cognitive functions. Although we have attempted to control for some of the more obvious motor related activity, the contrasts included in the study are unlikley to control for factors such as executive control, working memory, and attention. Given that we do not have any estimate of intelligence or school performance in our participants, the possibility of group differences in overall executive ablility could be driving some of the group differences noted in the task.
