Recent meta-analyses using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show that schizophrenia is characterized by reductions in gray matter, which occur before full symptom onset and progress more quickly in the acute exacerbation state and treatment-resistant state, compared with the treatment-responsive state. For example, reported that first-episode schizophrenia and schizotypal patients showed significant decreases in gray matter volume in the left transverse temporal gyrus and left planum temporale approximately 2\u20137\u00a0years after an initial assessment, compared with control samples. Although the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying progressive deterioration in the left transverse temporal gyrus and left planum temporale in schizophrenia are unknown, a growing body of work has implicated abnormal excitatory amino acid neurotransmission, possibly mediated by a deficit in recurrent inhibition. Although controversial, this mechanism could elicit ongoing, use-dependent cellular damage mediated via excitotoxic effects.

In healthy individuals, the ASSR contains resonant frequencies around 40-Hz and 80-Hz, with a larger power at 40-Hz. The power of the ASSR is enhanced at these frequencies. At the cellular level, the generation and maintenance of gamma oscillations critically depend on networks of fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons. In addition, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) signaling in parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons is critical for the regulation of spontaneous (non-stimulus locked) and evoked gamma oscillations. ASSR deficits in individuals with chronic schizophrenia have been correlated with reduced evoked gamma responses and increased spontaneous gamma activities during auditory stimulation, indicating that neural circuitry abnormalities in schizophrenia patients may be associated with an imbalance between excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA neurotransmission.

Recently, high gamma (>\u00a060-Hz) band oscillations have become an increasingly frequent subject of interest. For example, reported that high gamma band activities may be a fundamental aspect of temporal coding in cortical networks. Although the ASSR-BOLD may not independently reflect cognitive processes, this may be the case for the 80-Hz ASSR, as basic neural circuits that predominantly oscillate at high gamma frequencies might be more strongly implicated in cognitive processes. In another resting-state EEG study, reported that patients with schizophrenia at the untreated acute stage showed significantly higher spontaneous activities in high gamma (70 to 100-Hz) band, but not low gamma band. Given the question of why we only found hyperactivation for the 80-Hz stimuli, it is possible that increased spontaneous gamma activities are more apparent for 80-Hz compared with 40-Hz stimuli in the AESZ group. Alternatively, there may be a strong association between BOLD signals and high gamma band electrophysiological activities. The 80-Hz stimulation may be a resonant frequency for ASSR-BOLD responses in the AESZ group, resulting in hyperactivation for the 80-Hz stimuli only.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27888, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given the present data, we are not able to explain why the left auditory cortex was overactivated during 80-Hz ASSR stimulation. However, the left and right transverse temporal gyri and left planum temporale have some differential cytoarchitectonic features that may be implicated in lateralized activation. Previously, our group reported left-lateralized abnormally-evoked gamma oscillations to vowel sounds in patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, Dierks et al. demonstrated increased fMRI activation in the left transverse temporal gyrus during auditory hallucinations in right-handed individuals with schizophrenia. In the current study, increased severity of global auditory hallucinatory experiences was associated with larger BOLD percent signal changes in the left auditory cortex in the AESZ group. Thus, the present results may support the view that the left auditory cortex is the site of defective anatomical substrate associated with auditory hallucinations in acute schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28888, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We found group differences in the time course of alterations in ASSR-BOLD. Specifically, we found that, unlike the NASZ and HC groups, the AESZ group exhibited a BOLD increase in high gamma-band ASSRs, especially during the period from 9 to 18\u00a0s after the onset of 80-Hz stimuli. In the HC group, BOLD signals decreased from 6 to 9\u00a0s for the same stimuli. This phenomenon may be associated with ASSR habituation, as demonstrated by an exponential electrophysiological decrease following repeated exposure to stimuli in rats. Indeed, AESZ patients may show delayed habituation to 80-Hz stimuli; however, further studies will be needed to clarify this issue.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29545, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In interpreting the current study, it is important to consider several possible limitations. First, ASSR-BOLD responses are involved not only in gamma band activities, but broadband activities as well. However, only gamma band oscillations have been highly correlated with hemodynamic responses. The 80-Hz stimulation may be a resonant frequency with respect to the activation of ASSR-BOLD signals. Future studies should investigate this using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Second, our sample size was relatively small (24 HC, 14 NASZ, and 15 AESZ participants), partially due to the challenges of scanning schizophrenia patients in the acute phase. The association between 80-Hz ASSR-BOLD signals and auditory hallucinatory experiences should be confirmed in a larger sample.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30326, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we found that AESZ patients showed significantly increased BOLD signals during an 80-Hz ASSR compared with NASZ and HC participants.
