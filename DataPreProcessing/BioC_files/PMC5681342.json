Based on resting-state functional magnetic imaging data from 70 healthy controls (HCs), 53 CHR individuals (among which 41 subjects were antipsychotic medication-naive), and 58 early illness SZ (ESZ) patients (among which 53 patients took antipsychotic medication) within five years of illness onset, we estimated subject-specific INs using a novel group information guided independent component analysis (GIG-ICA) and investigated group differences in INs. We found that when compared to HCs, both CHR and ESZ groups showed significant differences, primarily in default mode, salience, auditory-related, visuospatial, sensory-motor, and parietal INs. Our findings suggest that widespread INs were diversely impacted. More than 25% of voxels in the identified significant discriminative regions (obtained using all 19 possible changing patterns excepting the no-difference pattern) from six of the 15 interrogated INs exhibited monotonically decreasing Z-scores (in INs) from the HC to CHR to ESZ, and the related regions included the left lingual gyrus of two vision-related networks, the right postcentral cortex of the visuospatial network, the left thalamus region of the salience network, the left calcarine region of the fronto-occipital network and fronto-parieto-occipital network. Compared to HCs and CHR individuals, ESZ patients showed both increasing and decreasing connectivity, mainly hypo-connectivity involving 15% of the altered voxels from four INs. The left supplementary motor area from the sensory-motor network and the right inferior occipital gyrus in the vision-related network showed a common abnormality in CHR and ESZ groups. Some brain regions also showed a CHR-unique alteration (primarily the CHR-increasing connectivity). In summary, CHR individuals generally showed intermediate connectivity between HCs and ESZ patients across multiple INs, suggesting that some dysconnectivity patterns evident in ESZ predate psychosis in attenuated form during the psychosis risk stage.

Prior to the onset of psychosis, a prodromal period lasting from a few weeks to several years typically occurs for most SZ patients. Individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis exhibit a psychosis-risk syndrome principally defined by the presence of attenuated forms of the positive symptoms characteristic of SZ. Approximately 35% of individuals meeting CHR criteria transitions to psychosis within 2.5\u00a0years of initial ascertainment in longitudinal studies. The majority of CHR individuals who convert to psychosis develop a disorder in the SZ spectrum. Yet, relatively few brain imaging studies directly compare CHR individuals with early illness SZ (ESZ) patients to determine whether functional brain abnormalities evident in ESZ are present in attenuated form, or in qualitatively distinct patterns, in the psychosis-risk syndrome. This knowledge gap is evident in the realm of brain intrinsic functional networks (INs) that reflect correlated activity among distributed brain regions. INs have shown promise as neuropsychiatric biomarkers for mental disorder diagnoses in general, and specific patterns of IN dysconnectivity have been reported in SZ. Although the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes for CHR individuals might lead to patterns of IN dysconnectivity that are qualitatively distinct from those observed in ESZ, the fact that the psychosis-risk syndrome is largely defined by attenuated forms of SZ positive symptoms leads us to hypothesize that CHR individuals may primarily show similar but attenuated IN dysconnectivity relative to ESZ patients. If true, this would suggest that the IN dysconnectivity patterns seen in SZ predate the onset of full-blown psychosis, albeit in a less severe manner. Moreover, given that most CHR individuals have had minimal or no prior exposure to antipsychotic medication, the presence of attenuated IN dysconnectivity in CHR individuals would provide strong evidence that the dysconnectivity findings in SZ patients are not secondary to the confounding effects of antipsychotic drugs. Accordingly, the current study sought to directly compare IN dysconnectivity patterns in CHR individuals and ESZ patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5575, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In order to extract INs from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, researchers have used one of two general analytic approaches: model-based and data-driven analyses. Among model-based approaches, the most widely used is the region of interest (ROI)-based method, which measures functional connectivity (correlation or coherence) among different ROIs or between a specified \u201cseed\u201d ROI and all other voxels in brain. Most previous IN studies of CHR individuals employed an ROI-based method seeded by thalamus, superior temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, Broca's area, or cerebellum. These studies computed correlations between the mean time series in a specific ROI and the time series of other voxels in brain. The identified IN abnormalities of CHR individuals were primarily located in the frontal lobes, temporal lobes, thalamus, sensory motor cortex and Heschl's gyrus, some of which also showed an intermediate degree of abnormality in the CHR syndrome compared to first episode psychosis. One limitation of such studies is that results depend on a somewhat arbitrary definition of a specific ROI, including delineation of its shape, extent, and precise location. Furthermore, such studies typically only focus on several predefined ROIs and thus do not evaluate IN patterns across the whole brain.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6961, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In contrast to ROI-based method, data-driven approaches estimating INs do not require specification of predefined ROIs. These increasingly popular approaches include spatial independent component analysis (ICA), principle component analysis (PCA), and clustering methods. In particular, ICA is a widely used approach that has shown great promise in identifying network-based biomarkers of psychiatric disorders such as SZ. Spatial ICA on individual-subject's fMRI data decomposes an fMRI data-converted matrix (time points\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0voxels) as a linear combination of multiple independent components (ICs), of which meaningful ICs can be regarded as INs. Advantages of ICA, relative to ROI-based methods, include that it does not require selecting prior ROIs and that it can simultaneously estimate multiple INs from whole-brain data. Different from ROI-based method which represents each IN as functional connectivity between different ROIs, ICA regards each spatial IC as an IN where voxels with higher Z-scores tend to have higher intra-connectivity (or co-activation). For multi-subject studies, group ICA approaches enable estimation of individual-subject components, some of which are identified as meaningful INs, based on group-level ICs. Traditional group ICA typically used either PCA-based or regression-based (e.g., dual regression) back-reconstruction. However, these methods cannot guarantee independence of individual-subject components. More recently, we have proposed a new back-reconstruction method called group information guided ICA (GIG-ICA). GIG-ICA utilizes a multi-objective function optimization algorithm to simultaneously optimize the independence among each subject's components as well as the correspondence between each group-level component and its associated subject-specific component, consequently resulting in more accurate networks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8823, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the present study, using resting-state fMRI data from CHR individuals, ESZ patients, and healthy controls (HCs), we estimate whole-brain multiple INs for each subject using the GIG-ICA method and then investigate all possible network changing patterns in each IN.

We further hypothesize that CHR individuals would generally show similar, but attenuated, dysconnectivity across many INs in which ESZ patients show dysconnectivity, consistent with their attenuated positive symptoms relative to ESZ patients. However, given that dysconnectivity in some INs may emerge after the onset of schizophrenia, we expect to find some INs that showed dysconnectivity in ESZ patients but normal connectivity in CHR individuals.

Our method primarily involved the following three steps. First, based on the temporally-concatenated fMRI data of 181 subjects, ICA with the Infomax algorithm was used to estimate the group-level ICs. In order to decrease the influence of random initializations, we performed ICASSO with 20 ICA runs followed by selection of the most reliable ICA run to obtain reliable group-level ICs. Before the group-level ICA, subject-level and group-level PCAs were applied to reduce the dimensionality of the fMRI data. In this study, the number of ICs was set to 30 based on previous work, and the number of principle components used in the subject-level PCAs was specified as a greater number (i.e., 60) as recommended. Thus, 30 group -level ICs were obtained and Z-scored. It is worth noting that the sign of each resulting group-level IC is arbitrary. In our study, we computed the skewness of each IC and flipped the IC if its skewness was negative. Consequently, the positive Z-scores in each IC represented the voxels contributing the most to the associated network. Second, we manually identified the meaningful group-level networks after carefully inspecting all group-level ICs' spatial maps. If the primary activation of one IC's spatial map is located in gray matter, smooth and continuous, we preferred to regard it as an interesting functional network. Also, we referred to networks reported in previous studies to further confirm. The removed noise-related group-level ICs reflected head motion, physiological noise, and influence of scanner. Third, the remaining meaningful group-level ICs were characterized as the group-level INs and then used to calculate the subject-specific INs based on a multi-objective function optimization algorithm.

Therefore, for one specific IN, a region containing voxels with high positive Z-scores (taking a region only including two voxels as an example, Z-scores of two voxels\u00a0=\u00a010 and 9) tends to have stronger co-activation (i.e., positive correlation) within the IN compared to a region containing voxels with low positive Z-scores (e.g., Z-scores of two voxels\u00a0=\u00a02 and 1). In such case, the mean of the Z-scores in one region can reflect the co-activation extent of the region. In fact, if a region contains voxels with greater negative Z-scores (e.g., Z-scores of two voxels\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a010 and \u2212\u00a09) relative to the other region (e.g., Z-scores of two voxels\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a02 and \u2212\u00a01), the former also tends to have stronger co-activation than the later. In this study, considering that the positive Z-scores contributing the most include important spatial maps in each IN, we focused on investigating group differences in voxels primarily associated with positive Z-scores to simplify the subsequent analyses. It is also worth pointing out that if one region includes both higher and lower positive Z-scores (e.g., Z-scores of two voxels\u00a0=\u00a010 and 1) compared to the other region (e.g., Z-scores of two voxels\u00a0=\u00a02 and 8), we cannot determine which region has greater co-activation using Z-scores.

Specifically, for each significant voxel in the network mask identified, we performed two-tailed two-sample t-tests (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) on its Z-score for three pairs of groups (HC vs. CHR, CHR vs. ESZ, and HC vs. ESZ) and then examined whether its Z-score exhibited one of 19 characteristic patterns. Among the 19 patterns, two patterns (Fig. 1A\u2013B) corresponded to strictly decreasing and strictly increasing Z-scores from HC to CHR to ESZ. For example, for the strictly decreasing pattern, t-value\u00a0>\u00a00 was required for both the HC vs. CHR test and the CHR vs. ESZ test, reflecting significant decreases in Z-scores from the healthy condition to the psychosis-risk state and from the risk-state to full-blown schizophrenia. Four patterns (Fig. 1C\u2013F) involved situations where the ESZ or HC group was significantly lower or significantly higher than the other two groups. For example, in the ESZ-decreasing pattern, t-value\u00a0>\u00a00 was required for both the HC vs. ESZ and CHR vs. ESZ comparisons, with no significant difference between the HC and CHR groups. Six additional patterns (Fig. 2G\u2013L) were CHR-unique alteration related patterns in which the CHR group had significantly lower or higher Z-scores than the other two groups. For example, in terms of the CHR-decreasing pattern 1 (Fig. 2G), we required t-value\u00a0>\u00a00 for the HC vs. CHR comparison as well as t-value\u00a0<\u00a00 for the CHR vs. ESZ comparison, with no significant difference between the ESZ and HC groups. There were also six patterns (Fig. 1M\u2013R) in which only one pair of groups showed a group difference. Taking the HC\u00a0>\u00a0ESZ pattern for an example, t-value\u00a0>\u00a00 for the HC vs. ESZ comparison and no group differences for other comparisons were required. Finally, a no-difference pattern (Fig. 2S) was possible, where all three groups showed no significant differences (i.e., p\u00a0>\u00a00.05 for all comparisons). Regarding each pattern, the associated voxels were identified and then corrected (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for multiple comparisons using Monte Carlo simulation (N\u00a0=\u00a01000) to obtain regions each of which were spatially continuous. Thus, each remaining region was required to have a size greater than a given voxel number that was determined by the threshold p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and the network mask from the voxel-wise one-sample t-tests using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. Except for the last pattern representing no significant difference across groups, we named the identified regions as significant discriminative regions (SDRs) within the associated INs. In our work, we applied two-tailed two-sample t-tests to define the changing patterns because we cannot make a hypothesis that one group (e.g., HC) shows higher (or lower) Z-scores in network than the other group (e.g., CHR). We are testing for the possibility of the relationship in both directions (i.e., the possibility of one group shows higher and lower Z-scores than the other group).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25219, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the third step, for each SDR including voxels with the same pattern in a specific IN, we tested whether its co-activation differed significantly among the HC, CHR and ESZ groups.

Since Fisher's combined probability test was proposed originally under an assumption of independence among separate tests, we also performed a non-parametric combination method including 10,000 permutations as a supplement. The non-parametric combination procedure works even when independence is untenable. The detailed steps for the non-parametric combination method are described in the Supplementary materials. If the combined p-value of one comparison between two groups was smaller than 0.05/3, we regarded the co-activation in SDR significantly different between the two groups. Additionally, since the mean Z-score within voxels of each SDR can be used to reflect co-activation strength in the SDR, we calculated the Pearson correlation between the co-activation strengths of each SDR within one specific IN and the symptom severity ratings (in Table 1) for the CHR group and the ESZ group to explore the association between network measures and symptoms.

First, a few parameters (e.g., the number of ICs used in GIG-ICA and the thresholds used for multiple comparisons correction) are adjustable and the specific settings we chose may have influenced the pattern of results we observed. Second, insufficient clinical follow-up data from our CHR participants prevented us from examining whether any of the IN abnormalities identified are predictive of conversion to psychosis. We will investigate this issue in the future when more data are available. Third, due to the relatively small sample sizes available for this study, we included a small number of CHR individuals who were treated with antipsychotic medication. Most of the ESZ patients analyzed took antipsychotic medication. Although we did not find significant associations between the medication and the identified measures showing group differences, influence of medication could be complex and deserves further investigation in future. In addition, we did not assess and cannot address whether treatment response or treatment resistance moderated functional connectivity in the ESZ patients, since we did not assess the treatment response information and also did not require stable doses of medication for entry into the study. However, to the extent that many of the IN abnormalities observed were evident in both ESZ and CHR individuals, there is a diminished likelihood that the network abnormalities observed in ESZ patients are the result of antipsychotic medication. Finally, since we flipped the estimated group-level ICs to ensure that their skewness was positive, in order to simplify the analyses for each IN, we only focused on the voxels with positive Z-scores in most subjects, i.e., those voxels that contributed the most to the networks (see Fig. S2).
