For instance, in comparison to non-drug users, individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD) show reduced engagement of brain regions involved in executive control during cognitive tasks. Additionally, the communication between executive control brain regions is reduced in abstinent individuals with CUD relative to healthy controls. This is particularly relevant since increased interhemispheric coupling in frontoparietal regions is associated with better executive functioning and attention. These interhemispheric coupling deficits are associated with drug-related behavior as cocaine relapse vulnerability is heightened in those with reduced interhemispheric coupling of the executive control network (ECN), a resting state network comprised of two primary hubs underling cognitive control: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Due to this networks\u2019 anatomy and function, it is sometimes also referred to as the frontoparietal network.

We subsequently assessed whether the relationship between ECN coupling and days since last cocaine use was driven by the PFC or PPC ECN-subregions, which are thought to be involved in shared and also distinct cognitive functions. The PFC is associated with top-down volitional attentional control, whereas the PPC is thought to have additional involvement with bottom-up attentional processing. Since these regions have been associated with different patterns of coupling during attentional control tasks, the extent to which resting state interhemispheric coupling is related to recency of cocaine use may also vary between the PFC and PPC hubs of the ECN.

The role of dopamine in PFC interhemispheric connectivity also fits with our follow-up analysis, which showed a relationship between days since last cocaine use and interhemispheric connectivity of the PFC ECN-subregion but not PPC ECN-subregion.

Additionally, though cigarette smoking can enhance interhemispheric coupling, smoking intensity was minimal in our sample and smoking related variables had no significant effects on interhemispheric ECN coupling strength. Despite these limitations, the current results provide initial evidence linking recency of cocaine use with disrupted ECN coupling, which may compromise the ability to maintain abstinence.
