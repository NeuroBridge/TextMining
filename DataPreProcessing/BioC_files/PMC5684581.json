We used parallel ICA for multimodal data fusion for the 20 LTAA and 21 NSAC that had both usable fMRI and 64-channel EEG data. Our major result was that parallel ICA identified a pair of components that significantly separated NSAC from LTAA and were correlated with each other. Examination of the resting-state fMRI seed-correlation map component showed higher bilateral nucleus accumbens seed-correlation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and lower seed-correlation in the thalamus. This single component thus encompassed both the executive control and appetitive drive networks, consistent with our previous work. The correlated EEG coherence component showed mostly higher theta and alpha coherence in LTAA compared to NSAC, and lower gamma coherence in LTAA compared to NSAC.

From a neurobiological perspective this pattern implies weak \u201ctop-down\u201d executive control over impulsive and compulsive urges to consume alcohol, and a strong \u201cbottom-up\u201d appetitive drive to impulsively and compulsively consume alcohol.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3061, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In 2013, we measured social deviance proneness, antisocial disposition, and both lifetime and current antisocial symptoms in both short-term abstinent alcoholics (STAA) and long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAA) compared to controls.

If it can be confirmed in longitudinal studies that the degree of these changes in the appetitive drive and executive control networks is associated with and predictive of successful abstinence, then interventions that directly augment these changes, such as neurofeedback that \u201cfeeds back\u201d measures of brain network synchrony, may have treatment potential for recovering alcoholics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6086, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Though technically possible, it is at present neither practical nor economically feasible to use neurofeedback to modify fMRI RSS. Furthermore, although fMRI provides high confidence in the identification of anatomical regions that contribute to the executive control and appetitive drive networks, it is unable to reflect the sequential neural activity underlying cognitive states of readiness or execution of a task due to the poor time resolution of the BOLD response, which at best is on the scale of hundreds of milliseconds, compared to the millisecond resolution of EEG. Converging evidence suggests that the fMRI BOLD response reflects the summed neural activity of several oscillatory EEG networks (for a review, see). These EEG networks may oscillate at multiple frequencies (e.g., theta, alpha, or gamma) and the activity of separate networks may vary as a function of cognitive states lasting only a few hundred milliseconds. fMRI networks involved in task processing are likely to be comprised of multiple oscillatory EEG networks reflecting both induced and evoked EEG responses, including those that derive from frequency-dependent changes in phase alignment. Therefore, the identification of EEG networks underlying executive control and appetitive drive could potentially reveal more about the mechanisms underlying the processing and inhibition of the cascades consequent to alcohol cues that contribute to the maintenance of abstinence, because of the more complex nature of EEG measures of brain activity that dynamically change at the same pace as cognitive processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7676, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Other researchers have explored brain networks derived from scalp-recorded EEGs and their relationship to rs-fMRI networks.

Using fMRI task-related paradigms, many observed differences in activation in the executive control and appetitive drive networks have been associated with alcohol use, abuse, and dependence, suggesting that multiple brain regions can contribute to the poor decision making and risky behaviors seen in alcoholism (for a review, see). Increased activity in the amygdala and insula associated with inflexible poor decision making is found in binge drinkers, while lower activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is observed in short-term abstinent alcoholics during inhibition tasks, in adolescents with a family history of alcohol drinking during risky decision making and in adolescents without notable substance use involvement during response inhibition. Lesser activation of prefrontal executive control regions than seen in controls has been observed in alcoholics during spatial and verbal working memory tasks. Active drinkers show enhanced BOLD activation in the ventral striatum when presented with visual alcohol cues, also supporting the notion of a stronger appetitive and reward drive in current alcohol dependence. Active drinkers with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence show higher activity in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions during delayed reward decision compared to active drinkers without alcohol dependence, which may reflect alcoholics' increased demand of the executive control network when required to make decisions on behavior ruled by appetitive drive. These studies demonstrate that excessive alcohol use and even the genetic vulnerability to alcoholism (observed prior to initiating alcohol use) is associated with activation patterns different than controls in brain regions that are part of the executive control and appetitive drive network. Recent work has examined resting state fMRI synchrony in multiple brain networks in individuals with current AUDs. The fMRI time series measures of synchrony (i.e., average within network correlations of BOLD signal magnitude across the network's nodes) were computed for 14 networks in each of 422 individuals with active AUDs and 97 controls.

Gamma oscillations appear to combine activity of spatially localized groups of neurons (e.g., within visual cortex; within hippocampus). Increased gamma band synchrony between frontal and parietal regions has also been observed during recollection. Our results mostly show lower gamma coherence in the LTAA compared to NSAC within left ipsilateral regions.

Although alpha was once attributed to an inactive or \u201cidling\u201d brain, more recently the presence of alpha has been attributed to the suppression of brain responses to distractors and absence of bottom up processing. Theta-modulated gamma oscillations have been recorded and have been proposed as a model for short-term memory. Moreover, theta coherence between frontal and posterior association regions has been shown to increase during the retention period of working memory tasks. Increasing theta coherence was also found during a mental imagery task. These alpha and theta coherence results from the literature suggest that alpha and theta coherence might be a characteristic feature of top-down processing. If so, the observed increase in alpha and theta coherence we observe in LTAA may actively suppress the brain's response to alcohol cues, increasing inhibitory control and emotion regulation, and reducing appetitive drive.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40059, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our EEG results seem to show more pronounced coherence differences between NSAC and LTAA in the left hemisphere.

Multimodal analysis of fMRI and EEG is an active area of research, with different approaches targeted toward the goals of each study. A recently published paper investigated frequency-specific ECoG (electrocorticography) correlates of resting state fMRI networks in epileptic patients, using a technique that mapped the fMRI signal onto the ECoG electrode locations, filtered the timeseries to compute band-limited power, computed correlations between all electrode pairs (separately for ECoG and mapped fMRI signals), then compared the resulting correlation maps between modalities. They found that theta band-limited power corresponded more strongly to fMRI in the default mode network and fronto-parietal control system, while alpha band-limited power corresponded more strongly to fMRI in the sensorimotor and dorsal attention network. Another recent paper examined simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI and preprocessed EEG using either a microstate analysis or spontaneous power analysis to create normalized frequency-specific timecourses for convolution with the BOLD timeseries for use as regressors in a general linear model with fMRI data. A third approach that was recently used utilizes a sliding window of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data to examine whether temporal variations in coupling are associated with the amplitude of alpha and theta oscillations. These three approaches all directly compare the timeseries of EEG to fMRI and try to account for differing temporal and spatial resolutions of the two modalities. Since we did not record the EEG and fMRI simultaneously, we did not compare timeseries or adjust for different spatial resolutions in our analysis, but instead used parallel ICA to look for features in derived maps (either seed-correlation or coherence) that covaried across subjects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 43684, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although our results are encouraging, our analysis is limited. We only analyzed 20 LTAA and 21 NSAC, and our confidence would increase if our results were replicated in a larger sample or independent sample. Also, in this initial attempt to find EEG correlates of rs-fMRI networks, we only examined the magnitude-squared coherence. It is possible that the phase-angle component of coherence carries important information, and future work should consider both amplitude and phase. It is worth pointing out that our resting EEG was acquired with eyes open, in order to minimize the influence of the alpha rhythm that dominates at parietal electrodes during the eyes closed condition, while the rs-fMRI was acquired with eyes closed. It is unclear whether this acquisition difference affected our results. Another limitation is that our rs-fMRI scans are only about 4\u00a0min long, while recent work suggests that much longer scans (on the order of 8\u201312\u00a0min) are required for stability and reproducibility of network measurements. These two limitations (eyes closed vs. eyes open and length of EEG and fMRI acquisition) underscore that our major limitation is that the fMRI and EEG were not obtained simultaneously. Ideally, we would use simultaneous recording of EEG and rs-fMRI to identify EEG indices that vary on a moment-to-moment basis in conjunction with rs-fMRI.
