The risk of ASD in individuals who have a sibling with schizophrenia is several-fold more than the typical population. Several previous studies showed shared synaptic-related genetic deficits in these two disorders, such as the gene APBA2 which regulates synaptic adaptor proteins, gene ASTN2 which regulates neural recognition molecules, gene DLG1, DLG2, DLGAP2, LRFN5, NRXN1, PCDH19, SHANK3 and TSPAN7 which regulate synaptic scaffolding, organization and formation.

A meta-analysis also indicates some common neural basis contributing to atypical social cognition in schizophrenia and ASD. Several studies have reported abnormal connectivity patterns within the DMN and SN, and implied that these atypical connections were related to social deficits in ASD. Our multivariate regression analysis also showed a significant relationship between the connections in DMN and SN and the social deficits of ASD. For schizophrenia, atypical social cognition is also thought to be related to the DMN. Social reward salience as a negative symptom in schizophrenia is thought to contribute to social cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. We speculated that the shared atypical connections in DMN and SN might be a factor of the shared social deficits between ASD and schizophrenia.

We hypothesize that these different patterns may be related to the different syndromes between ASD and schizophrenia. Although ASD and schizophrenia have several shared synaptic-related genetic deficits and these two disorders were regarded as same disorder in history, the current version of DSM has classified ASD and schizophrenia as two disorders. The shared behavior deficits between these two disorders are more concentrated in social cognition aspect and previous studies have reported more convergent social cognitive functioning deficits than divergent. Meanwhile, some differences in atypical social cognition in these two disorders have also been reported. For example, Sasson et al. compared eye movement patterns when assessing emotion content between participants with ASD and schizophrenia. They found that individuals with ASD and schizophrenia shared deficits in using facial information to assess emotional content, but differed in the ability to seek out social cues from complex stimuli. Abu-Akel suggested that individuals with ASD and schizophrenia exhibit different forms of theory of mind impairment.
