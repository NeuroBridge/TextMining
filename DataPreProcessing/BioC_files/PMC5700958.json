Cerebral blood flow (CBF), as a biomarker of activation in the brain, reflects the neuronal metabolism, and is promisingly used to detect cerebral alteration thereby shedding light on the features of individuals at high genetic risk. We performed a cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study enrolling 45 first-episode drug-na\u00efve patients with SZ, 32 unaffected first-degree relatives of these patients, and 51 healthy controls (HCs). We examined CBF, CBF connectivity, and CBF topological properties. SZ patients showed increased CBF in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and right precuneus compared with HCs, and decreased CBF in the left middle temporal gyrus compared with their relatives. Furthermore, unaffected relatives revealed higher level of CBF pronounced in regions within default mode network (DMN). Both SZ patients and their relatives exhibited dysconnectivity patterns. Notably, as for the network properties, unaffected relatives were with an intermediate level between SZ patients and HCs in the local efficiency and global efficiency.

However, the common and unique functional cerebral deficits between SZ patients and their unaffected relatives remain unclear to a large extent.

With the progress of the noninvasive of arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), novel and quantitative approach to the measurement of resting-state CBF could be provided. ASL uses magnetically labeled arterial blood water as an endogenous tracer, reflects the level of neuronal activity, and is comparable with positron emission tomography (PET). Accordingly, SZ patients have exhibited increased or decreased CBF in different brain regions, with hypo-perfusion in the frontal lobes, anterior and medial cingulated gyri and the parietal lobe, while increased perfusion in the cerebellum, brainstem and thalamus, compared with healthy controls (HCs). Moreover, several resting-state CBF alterations have been related to the core clinical symptoms of SZ or motor behavior. However, the results, especially the activated brain regions, are not all inclusive or consistent. A number of confounding factors, such as small sample sizes, heterogeneous treatment conditions, and/or durations of illness may count for the inconsistent results of previous studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3436, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The CBF may change synchronously in different brain regions to act similar network function.

Because of the functional connection between the DMN and internal mentation, the activation of DMN might be involved in misattribution of thoughts in SZ. With the boundary between imagined scenarios and blurred external attention, psychopathological phenomena such as auditory hallucinations may thus occur.

DMN, as one of the most acknowledged networks, is related with construction of an integrated self-representation which underlying pathogenesis in SZ. In addition to the left medial superior frontal gyrus, the right precuneus detected in our findings is another part of DMN. It has been reported that in first-episode, drug-na\u00efve SZ patients, several dysconnectivity in DMN and between DMN with other networks could be found. During cognitively demanding tasks, DMN usually tends to represent deactivation, for the purpose of regulating the balance with the central-executive network. While increased CBF values may stand for aberrant activation of DMN in our study, which may cause troubles like failure in constructing proper self-referential stimulations. The left medial superior frontal gyrus, as a part consisted in DMN and left dorsal attention network, plays a crucial role in SZ. Its impaired connectivity with other regions may lead to deficits such as error in processing internal signals, and generating attention signals of current task, impairments in activation of sensory and motor regions, and all those alterations may lead to symptoms in SZ.

Brain structural deficits in twins discordant for SZ were more pronounced in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins, suggesting association of cerebral abnormalities with genetic factors for SZ. During the past five years, many structural MRI studies have revealed that gray matter and white matter in individuals at high risk of SZ are unlike controls, but usually to a lesser extent than that of patients, indicating that structural abnormalities may form markers of susceptibility and transition to SZ, despite not definitely consistent findings. Also, a series of studies have demonstrated functional alterations in relatives of SZ patients at resting or task state, with significant results found in several specific brain regions. It has been well established that familial risk plays a significant role in the etiology of SZ through family, adoption, twin, and sibling studies. SZ as a hereditary component affects 0.3% to 0.7% of the general population globally according to American Psychiatric Association, whereas first-degree relatives have increased risk of developing SZ, with an actual prevalence of approximate 10%. In genetic epidemiology studies, first-degree relatives of SZ patients are 10 times more likely to develop SZ than people in the general population, and a 31% to 58% concordance rate exists in monozygotic twins. Patrick et al. have demonstrated that genetic liability to SZ was 81% (95% confidence interval: 73%, 90%) based on results from 12 twin studies of SZ.

Importantly, SZ patients\u2019 relatives are with an intermediate level between HCs and patients for local efficiency and global efficiency, implying an disrupted integration in larger and sparser network.

Our study provides an initial but comprehensive view of the CBF concurrent fluctuations-based network among brain areas for SZ patients and their relatives. As well, in our previous effective connectivity study using resting-state BOLD-functional MRI, we detected an abnormal pattern of anterior cingulate cortico-hippocampal connectivity in unaffected relatives of first-episode SZ.
