The statistical analysis of adjacency matrices was carried out using indices based on graph theory. Both CSD and REST reduced the influence of volume conducted currents. The largest group differences in connectivity were observed for the alpha band. Schizophrenic patients showed reduced connectivity strength, as well as a lower clustering coefficient and shorter characteristic path length for both measures of phase synchronization following CSD transformation or REST re-referencing. Reduced synchronization was accompanied by increased directional flow from the occipital region for the alpha band. Following the REST re-referencing, the sources of alpha activity were located at parietal rather than occipital derivations. The results of PLV and DTF demonstrated group differences in fronto-posterior asymmetry following CSD transformation, while for PLI the differences were significant only using REST. The only analysis that identified group differences in inter-hemispheric asymmetry was DTF calculated for REST. Our results suggest that a comparison of different connectivity measures using graph-based indices for each frequency band, separately, may be a useful tool in the study of disconnectivity disorders such as schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1762, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1775, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Schizophrenia is considered as a disorder of brain disconnectivity, characterized by profound disruption of large-scale prefronto-temporal interactions. Animal models show that developmental hippocampal lesions may cause disconnectivity of the prefrontal cortex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in patients with schizophrenia have revealed gray matter volume deficits in the medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus) and in the heteromodal association cortex (including the prefrontal, anterior cingulate, superior temporal and parietal cortex, and the thalamus), as well as enlargement of the ventricles. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown decreased white matter anisotropy in the deep left prefrontal and temporal cortex, and reductions in the myelin membranes. The limbic pathways connecting the hippocampus with the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus are involved in higher cognition and information processing. Thus, one consequence of abnormal connectivity in schizophrenia may be a loss of coherent functional integration that results in a disorder of association processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2908, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The cortical disconnectivity hypothesis was also investigated by the analysis of neurophysiological data. The analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals, due to their high temporal resolution, provides unique information regarding neuronal oscillations and cross-frequency coupling, i.e. interactions between different frequency bands. These interactions have been shown to be impaired in schizophrenia. The analysis of EEG during a resting state condition showed increased delta, theta, and beta activity, as well as decreased activity in alpha frequency in the frontal cortex (\u201chypofrontality\u201d) in patients relative to controls. Another feature of the brain, which has emerged as an attractive potential biomarker of schizophrenia, is abnormal brain asymmetry. The hemispheres of the human brain are anatomically and functionally asymmetric and many cognitive and motor functions are lateralized. For example, in healthy persons, language processing is lateralized to the left hemisphere of the brain. Such leftward cerebral dominance is reduced in patients with schizophrenia, which may result in language impairment. DTI studies have shown structural reductions in some key white matter tracts (e.g. corpus callosum), which may contribute to abnormal intra-hemispheric connectivity in schizophrenia, as well as impaired transfer of information from the right to the left hemisphere. Moreover, hemispheric asymmetry is associated with a reduction of gray matter in frontal and temporal areas. Although the mechanism underlying left-hemisphere dominance is presently unknown, studies suggest a role for early disturbance in neuronal development. It has even been suggested that language and psychosis have a common evolutionary origin, and that schizophrenia may be related to genetic variation occurring during evolution of hemispheric dominance for language in Homo sapiens. The pattern of functional asymmetry in schizophrenia may differ between patients suffering from positive and negative symptoms. While positive symptoms are associated with an increase of leftward asymmetry, negative symptoms are associated with an increase of rightward asymmetry of functional connectivity. Other studies report an association between increased activation in the right hemisphere and auditory hallucinations (e.g. perceiving one's own thoughts as an external voice) and delusions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5324, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interactions between functionally specialized brain areas can be described by means of different connectivity measures and indices based on graph theory. There are three classes of connectivity: anatomical (or structural), functional, and effective. Anatomical connectivity is defined as the network of physical connections between brain structures. Functional connectivity refers only to statistical dependences between these structures, while effective connectivity provides information about the causal interactions between (or among) them. The statistical significance of these measures can be evaluated using indices based on graph theory. In graph theory, the brain is modelled as a graph composed of nodes that represent EEG channels, and links that represent the connectivity between them. In contrast to random networks, normal brain network organization is characterized by small-worldness, e.g., shorter characteristic path lengths and higher local clustering (existence of modules and high-degree nodes, i.e. hubs). Such network architecture enables optimal information processing and network robustness. Another important characteristic of normal brain network organization is hierarchy, which is reflected in a fractal nature of network organization, i.e., existence of self-similarity pattern at every spatial and temporal scale, as well as different structural and functional organization levels. This network architecture, expressed by structural and functional connectivity, is disrupted in some neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (reviewed by). Network abnormalities exhibit topological patterns specific to each disorder.
