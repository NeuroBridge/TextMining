Traditionally, DCM has been used to test competing hypotheses about brain networks comprising only a few regions (usually\u00a0<\u00a06) and directed connections.

Following this approach, several studies have found abnormalities in effective connectivity in the fronto-temporal network, the fronto-parietal network and the default mode network during working memory tasks in schizophrenia or psychosis.

We did this using Bayesian model reduction (BMR) that enables the evidence and parameters of nested (reduced) models to be derived directly from a full model. This provides an efficient search of the model space by scoring each reduced model, based on its log model-evidence or free energy; for details, see.

Note that these parameters are log scale parameters such that a negative difference corresponds to a smaller self-inhibition; namely, a relative disinhibition in patients. Thus, we could be confident that left FEF and left SPL were more readily excited by afferent activity in patients with schizophrenia than controls. There were also small differences in extrinsic connections, demonstrated by coupling among regions in the DAN (bilateral FEF and lSPL) and between regions of the DAN and the other networks.

From the perspective of predictive coding, these changes may reflect an aberrant precision or salience of prediction errors at the associated levels of the cortical hierarchy. To briefly reprise, in predictive coding, neuronal representations in higher levels of cortical hierarchies generate predictions of representations in lower levels. These top-down predictions are compared with representations at the lower level to form a prediction error (usually associated with the activity of superficial pyramidal cells). This mismatch signal is passed back up the hierarchy, to update higher representations (associated with the activity of deep pyramidal cells). This recursive exchange of signals suppresses prediction error at each and every level to provide a hierarchical explanation for sensory inputs. Besides predicting the content of our sensations, the brain also has to predict the context in terms of expected or subjective precision. The brain may solve this generic problem by modulating the gain or excitability of neuronal populations reporting prediction errors. In the DCM framework, this gain is parameterized as the self-inhibition of superficial pyramidal cells within a cortical source. During the n-back task, the participant implicitly predicts whether the next stimulus is the same as the previously presented stimulus and a prediction error may emerge while comparing the current stimulus with the previously presented stimulus. In this context, the impaired self-connections in the dorsal attention network in patients with schizophrenia reflect a disinhibition in the superficial pyramidal cells in the constituent dorsal fronto-parietal regions. The disinhibition of the dorsal attention network in patients with schizophrenia may correspond to aberrant precision, which is thought to be encoded by the postsynaptic gain of neurons reporting prediction error.

NMDA-R hypofunction on fast-spiking and parvalbumin-contained interneurons, which are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic cells, is thought to lead to a failure in the regulation of the firing rate of pyramidal glutamatergic cells through inhibitory GABAergic input and thus causes an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in prefrontal cortex.
