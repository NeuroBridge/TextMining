Fig. 6a shows the concatenated mean FD traces for all scanning sessions that included at least 3 \u00d7 5 min rs-fcMRI runs. A few observations are noteworthy. First, in the higher moving clinical cohorts, mean FD values increased with time in scanner (Fig. 6a). There also appears to be a small \u201creset\u201d in mean FD such that head movement is lower for the start of the next run relative to the end of the prior session. In contrast, for the lower moving control cohort, mean FD increased only minimally over time. The percentage of low movement frames (FD < 0.2 mm) for the entire cohort is shown in Fig. 6b, which indicates that the percentage of low movement frames (FD < 0.2 mm) across each cohort declined only minimally with time spent in the scanner. Fig. 6b suggests that the accumulation of low movement frames over time should be relatively linear, which is verified by the low-movement frame accumulation plot in Fig. 6c. The same observations hold true when analyzing median FD values instead of mean FD (Supplementary Fig. 4). Given these findings, we chose a basic linear model to make real-time predictions about how long each participant would need to be scanned in order to reach the data criterion specified by the FIRMM user (Fig. 6d). Using this model, we showed that after 100 data frames have been acquired, FIRMM makes accurate predictions about how much longer a participant must remain in the scanner in order to reach a certain number of low movement data frames (Fig. 6e). FIRMM\u2019s continuously updating prediction algorithm displays an estimate of how much longer it will take to reach the pre-specified low movement data criterion (see Fig. 1).

We compared the calculation of FD currently implemented in FIRMM with the Offline method previously used in our laboratories. FD values generated by FIRMM differ from the Offline values in two ways: 1) FIRMM aligns all EPI images to the first frame of the run instead of the middle one, and 2) FIRMM operates on the raw images prior to debanding and slice-time-correction. Both of these processing changes should in principle be advantageous. We showed that the first frame of a run, on average, has slightly lower head motion (Fig. 6a), which slightly decreases the likelihood that the reference frame might become contaminated by head motion. In addition, Jonathan Power has argued that FD numbers need to be calculated on raw BOLD data (prior to debanding, slice-time correction), because temporal interpolation could dampen apparent head motion. Thus, FIRMM\u2019s method of calculating FD values might in principle be preferable over our previous Offline approach.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47979, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our comparisons between the FIRMM and Offline FD values showed that they are highly congruent (r = 0.98). We also compared the FIRMM and Offline FD values in their effectiveness for removing distance-dependent artifacts by repeating the original analysis used to first describe distance-dependent head motion artifact with our 1134 scan sessions. Frame-censoring based on the FIRMM and Offline FD values seemed to remove distance dependent artifact to an equal degree (Fig. 4). Therefore, it seems reasonable and possibly more technically accurate to utilize FD values calculated prior to debanding and slice-time correction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48605, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given that several other methods for calculating FD are currently in use (AFNI, FSL, SPM, etc.), we are planning on adding real-time versions of all commonly used FD calculation methods to future versions of FIRMM.

It has been proposed that very large head movements can also distort subsequent data frames. Therefore, some research groups remove one or more additional frames following high movement frames, while others do not. At the moment FIRMM is able to perform analyses on the number of frames below a certain FD cutoff, but it cannot yet process more complex contingencies, such as removing n frames following a head movement of a certain magnitude. Thus, we are planning on releasing future versions of FIRMM that will allow scanner operators to input more complex frame censoring algorithms. Other factors such as chest movements, for example, can distort the magnetic field (B0) and induce artifacts. Therefore, future versions of FIRMM will also track DVARs, a measure of how much the whole brain signal intensity varies from each data frame to the next that is sensitive to other sources of artifact besides head motion.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50122, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we contend that MRI sequences of the future should always be coupled to a real-time quality control display for the scanner operator and include the option of feeding back information about data quality to the participant.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50357, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50380, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Author contributions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50401, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "N.U.F.D and J.M.K. initiated the study.
