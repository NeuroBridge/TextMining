Several different animal models of schizophrenia have been reported, such as amphetamine-sensitized rats, mice deficient in types 2 and 3 metabotropic glutamate receptors, trace amine 1 receptor knockout mice, and rats with a neonatal hippocampus lesion. Interestingly, dopamine super-sensitivity and marked increase in D2High without significant increase in total D2Rs have been observed in most of these animal models. These findings imply that there may be a variety of mechanisms that can lead to increases in D2High. As such, it appears that D2High could be one of the common mechanisms of schizophrenia. Although molecular processes triggering this change are not clear, one explanation might be that the constant oscillation between the high- and low-affinity states of D2R is altered in schizophrenia, and the conversion rate of D2High to D2Low may be slower than a normal condition, resulting in an increase in the proportion of D2High. The extent of the group difference in the BPND ratio observed in our study was not as prominent as the increase in the proportion of D2High shown in animal models of psychosis. This might be due to the difference between in vitro tissue assays and in vivo PET imaging, and it is likely that a low-grade but long-lasting abnormality of D2High over decades may lead to the onset of schizophrenia. There is also a possibility that the contribution of D2High alterations vs other neurochemical factors to the etiology of schizophrenia might be variable among individuals in consideration of the heterogeneity of neuroreceptor statuses in subjects with this disease. The current work indicated a higher proportion of D2High in the putamen of patients with schizophrenia, while it is yet to be elucidated how neurochemical and functional abnormalities in this striatal subregion contribute to the onset of the disease. MRI studies have documented involvements of putaminal volume changes in the evolution of a clinical high risk status for psychosis and worsening of clinical outcomes in schizophrenia. Hence, mechanistic links between these morphological alterations and a dysregulated affinity state of D2R in the putamen may need to be investigated in subjects at clinical high risk and with schizophrenia by longitudinal PET and MRI assays.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20678, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For the D2R/D3R selectivity of radioligands, unlike [11C]PHNO, both [11C]raclopride and [11C]MNPA have similar affinities to D2R and D3R according to an in vitro study.

A previous PET study with [11C]raclopride has reported its elevated binding in the caudate and putamen in medication-free patients with depression compared with healthy subjects, suggesting the possible involvement of dopaminergic neurotransmission in depression and depressed subjects. Our results might indicate specific associations between depressive symptoms in schizophrenia and D2R availability in the caudate, in a manner independent of its affinity states. Since BPND values of both antagonistic [11C]raclopride and agonistic [11C]MNPA were correlated with the depression score, densities of D2Rs rather than occupancy of D2R by endogenous dopamine may increase in association with a depressive state. This dopaminergic modulation might not efficiently compensate for the mood change, in light of somewhat limited therapeutic application of dopaminergic stimulants to depressive conditions.

First, the sample size is relatively small, and the demographic compositions of gender and smokers vs nonsmokers are not equal between the 2 groups numerically, if not statistically. In addition, a previous PET study in a healthy population reported that central striatal D2R/D3R availability was negatively correlated with recent and lifetime smoking, and also with nicotine dependence. Another PET study reported a significant gender-by-smoking interaction on D2R/D3R availability in the caudate and putamen. These findings provide a rationale for the inclusion of gender and smoking as covariates of no interest, but an expanded analysis of patients and controls with a larger sample size and minimal inter-group differences in these factors will be required for more robust proof of the current results. Second, the temporal sequence of PET scans with [11C]raclopride and [11C]MNPA differed among the subjects. However, the occupancy of D2R by these ligands was <1% based on their injected mass doses, and the interval between the initiations of the first and second PET scans was longer than 120 minutes in all subjects. Hence, effects of the sequence of PET scans with the 2 ligands on quantitative data are considered negligible. Third, 3 different MRI devices were used to acquire anatomical information on the brains of the subjects. To minimize a possible confounding effect of MRI qualities on kinetic analyses, we used the standard MNI space to define ROIs, which were eventually transformed into individual PET spaces. Finally, we used only PANSS to evaluate symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.
