This study employed dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to conduct an analysis of effective (directional) connectivity involved in drug-related attentional bias in treatment-seeking CocUD subjects. The DCM analysis was conducted based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from fifteen CocUD subjects while performing a cocaine-word Stroop task, during which blocks of Cocaine Words (CW) and Neutral Words (NW) alternated. There was no significant attentional bias at group level. Although no significant brain activation was found, the DCM analysis found that, relative to the NW, the CW caused a significant increase in the strength of the right (R) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to R hippocampus effective connectivity. Greater increase of this connectivity was associated with greater CW reaction time (relative to NW reaction time). The increased strength of R ACC to R hippocampus connectivity may reflect ACC activation of hippocampal memories related to drug use, which was triggered by the drug cues. This circuit could be a potential target for therapeutics in CocUD patients.

This phenomenon refers to exaggerated attention to drug cues, which results in longer reaction times to drug related stimuli than to neutral stimuli. A related concept is drug cue reactivity, a kind of learned response which is often observed in individuals with substance use disorders and involves significant reactions (physiological and subjective) to drug cues (i.e., drug-related stimuli). The attentional bias and cue reactivity are commonly tested by comparing the measures obtained during exposure to drug stimuli versus neutral/non-drug-related stimuli in the same sensory domain. While visual stimuli (words and pictures) were mainly used in attentional bias studies (see, for review), stimuli used in cue reactivity studies are relatively versatile (see Jasinska et al., 2014, for review), including visual (words, pictures, and videos), auditory, audiovisual, tactile or haptic, olfactory or gustatory, or combined sensory domains. Surveys of the neuroimaging studies on attentional bias and drug cue reactivity (Jasinska et al., 2014) revealed that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum are common brain regions critical for both drug related attentional bias and drug cue reactivity. However, we are not aware any study which directly compares the neural networks underlying attentinoal bias and cue reactivity. A cocaine Stroop task, in which drug-related words are presented intermixed with neutral words, was used in the present study. Because drug Stroop tasks are commonly used to test drug related attnetional bias, we focused on attentional bias (rather than drug cue reactivity) in the remaining parts of this paper.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3320, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on the regional activation studies (e.g.,) which have employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate attentional bias in CocUD and other substance use disorders, hypothesized that the neural correlates underlying attentional bias result from the abnormal control of prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions, such as amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and striatum. A survey of these imaging studies and behavioral studies investigating attentional bias in CocUD indicates that drug cue reactivity was consistently reported in the behavioral studies, but the findings from the imaging studies are somewhat heterogeneous.

Functional connectivity and effective connectivity analyses are two commonly used brain connectivity methods. Functional connectivity refers to correlations among spatially remote neurophysiological events, while effective connectivity measures the causal (hence directional) influence of the neuronal activity in one region on a second region. To date, one functional connectivity study and one effective connectivity study which investigated attentional bias in CocUD subjects have been published. found that attentional bias could be related to a functional connectivity network consisting of frontal, occipitotemporal, parietal, cingulate, and premotor cortex. reported that during exposure to cocaine-related cues, CocUD subjects showed a particular feed-forward effective connectivity pattern (the feed-forward connectivities are the connectivities that do not form a cycle using feedback) among the nodes of a network (amygdala to hippocampus to dorsal striatum to insula to medial frontal cortex, DLPFC, and ACC).

A previous effective connectivity study reported significant effects of the emotion/reward regions over the prefrontal regions. However, there is no direct evidence supporting the critical role of the prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions during attentional bias. Thus, there is still a gap between theory and human imaging research regarding neuronal circuits underlying attentional bias. The present study aimed to reduce this gap through testing the effects exerted by the prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions. Toward that end, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to measure the effective connectivity upon exposure to cocaine-related cues in CocUD subjects. Effective connectivity rather than functional connectivity was selected because the direction of connectivity is modeled in effective connectivity, but the direction of connectivity cannot be determined using functional connectivity. Thus, effective connectivity analysis can distinguish the effects exerted by the prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions versus the effects exerted by the emotion/reward regions over the prefrontal regions. DCM has two major advantages over other effective connectivity analytic techniques. First, disease or drugs could affect neurovascular coupling and/or hemodynamic responses. In DCM, the parameter for the ratio of intra- and extravascular signals in the hemodynamic model of DCM is estimated from the observed blood oxygen level dependent signal, thus accounting for the individual difference in neurovascular coupling and/or hemodynamic responses. Second, DCM can measure effective connectivity under specific experimental conditions, rather than for the experiment as a whole. For example, the present study used a cocaine-word Stroop task in which blocks of cocaine words (CW) and neutral words (NW) alternated. DCM can distinguish the effective connectivity occurring upon exposure to CW versus NW, thus allowing measurement of the differential effects exerted by exposure to CW relative to NW on effective connectivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7506, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Heightened drug cue salience is associated with enhanced attention and with boosted unconscious memory processing of drug cues in CocUD subjects.

DCM with stochastic option, as implemented in SPM12 (Revision 6906), was used for effective connectivity analysis. DCM has been described elsewhere. In brief, the mathematical model of the underlying neuronal connectivity among an a priori selected set of brain regions is a system of bilinear differential state equations with coefficients specified by three matrices (A matrix, B matrix and C matrix). In this model, the experimental conditions (i.e., CW and NW) can serve as inputs to the model as either driving inputs, or modulatory inputs, or both. The DCM analysis determines which particular nodes in the model exhibit effective connectivity with other specific nodes in the model, which nodes receive driving inputs from experimental conditions into the model, and which specific connectivities between nodes in the model are modulated (i.e., changed in connectivity strength, in units of Hz) under experimental conditions. A node (driving input location) in the model that receives driving inputs, as quantified by the C matrix parameters, is the brain region among the nodes in the model which first experiences a change in neuronal activity. The node that receives the driving input then influences (\u201cdrives\u201d) the connectivity to other nodes in the model. The endogenous (or fixed) connectivity in DCM is quantified by the A matrix parameters, which measure the effective connectivity strengths (in units of Hz) between nodes, regardless of the moment-to-moment switching on and off of inputs.

Although no significant results were found in the behavioral data analysis and the brain regional activation analysis, the DCM analysis found that relative to the neutral word condition, the cocaine word condition caused a significant increase in the strength of the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity. In addition, the increase of this connectivity was positively associated with the cocaine word condition reaction time (relative to neutral word condition reaction time). These results support the hypothesis that the abnormal control of prefrontal regions over the emotion/reward regions, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and/or striatum, could be the neural basis underlying attentional bias. Different from a previous effective connectivity study which reported significant effects of the emotion/reward regions over the prefrontal regions, the present study revealed that the inverse circuit, i.e., the ACC to hippocampus effective connectivity, may also be important for drug related attentional bias as well. The identification of this circuit (R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity) reduces the gap between the existing theories regarding drug related attentional bias and current human imaging research. Activation of brain circuits associated with attentional bias could serve as a predictor or a target of treatment outcome in CocUD. Thus, the circuit found in this study could serve as a potentially novel target for treatment and preclinical studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27288, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The DCM analysis revealed that the CW minus NW modulator was related to a significant increase in the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity during the cocaine-word Stroop task. In addition, the modulatory change in this effective connectivity associated positively with \u0394RT in the CocUD subjects. These findings are similar to the results of a previous fMRI study in which the investigators found that in smokers there was a positive correlation between attentional bias to smoking words and brain activation (based on the contrast of smoking stimuli minus neutral stimuli) in the hippocampus and other brain regions (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, and occipital cortex). suggested that smoking cues may trigger smoking-affiliated memories, leading to the mental rehearsal of past smoking experiences. This suggestion was based on the role of hippocampus in memory recollection, which was defined as \u201cthe recovery of qualitative associations prompted by a critical cue\u201d. While DCM based effective connectivity does not require direct structural (or anatomical) connectivity, a recent study has found a direct structural connection (cingulum bundle) between ACC and hippocampus in humans. The ACC is a cortical region found to be important in recall of past memory (see for review). As concluded by, the ACC supports attention to and recognition of the cues that are most relevant to successful recall of behaviors learned in the past. Thus, based on the results reported by and the function of ACC in past memory recall, our DCM finding provides further support for the importance of the ACC and hippocampus in drug cue related memories. The positive correlation between the modulatory change of the R ACC to R hippocampus effective connectivity and \u0394RT supports this interpretation and implies that memories associated with drug use may be relatively more easily triggered by drug cues in the CocUD subjects with greater attentional bias.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29246, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results of increased connectivity between the R ACC to R hippocampus differ from a previous effective connectivity study.

The present study focused on the modulatory changes in effective connectivities exerted by the CW minus NW modulator, which reflects the differential effect of CW over NW. assessed effective connectivities during the cocaine-stimuli period only.

Two studies did not find a significant difference in reaction time between cocaine stimuli and neutral stimuli, unlike the results from five other studies (e.g.,). In addition, reaction time results were not reported in several other studies. These data suggest that the CocUD subjects may not always show attentional bias when exposed to drug cues.

The lack of attentional bias may be related to our inclusion/exclusion criteria (i.e., CocUD participants were included regardless of their UDS results). However, among the seven subjects with positive cocaine UDS, four showed attentional bias, and the other three subjects did not show attentional bias, suggesting that in the present study, the attentional bias could not be further evidenced by including only those who had positive UDS. Thus, the inclusion/exclusion criteria are unlikely to account for the null finding in group averaged behavioral performance. Nevertheless, the present study and previous studies indicated that in some cases, there was no average attentional bias for the CocUD group during the in-scanner versions of the Stroop tasks. Even in studies (e.g.,) reporting average group level attentional bias, not all the CocUD subjects showed attentional bias during the drug cue related Stroop tasks (See Figure 1 in as an example). These findings in the previous studies reflect individual difference in attentional bias among the CocUD individuals. Indeed, individual difference in attentional bias (or approach tendency bias) has been reported in CocUD and other substance use disorders. Focusing on individual differences associated with altered cognitive function has been suggested to be a strategy to improve the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. As suggested by and consistent with our findings, the presence of attentional bias could be an individual variable to consider for the evaluation of cognitive treatment in CocUD. The preliminary post-hoc analysis revealed that during the cocaine Stroop task, the CocUD subjects showing attentional bias and those not showing attentional bias had marginally different effective connectivity. Another limitation of the present study is the variance in the UDS results, which reflect recent drug use. As discussed above, the variance in the UDS results is unlikely to account for the lack of attentional bias in the present study. In addition, the correlation between the effective connectivity and \u0394RT was significant whether the UDS results were included as covariates or not included, suggesting that the variance in the UDS results did not affect the relationship between the effective connectivity and \u0394RT. However, we cannot exclude a negative effect of the variance in the UDS results on the replicabililty of the fMRI results. The third limitation is the limited number of analyzed ROIs (nodes). It is possible that other neural interconnectivities are also important for attentional bias but were not identified because the connecting regions were not included as nodes for the DCM analysis. One reason for the exclusion of potential nodes is study feasibility. With the increase in the number of nodes, the time needed for the DCM analysis increases quadratically. Thus, node selection criteria were used to control the number of nodes. Another reason was diminished statistical power for fMRI activation due to the variance in UDS results and the small sample size, which is another limitation of the present study. Future studies with more subjects and more strict inclusion/exclusion criteria will be helpful in providing greater insight into the altered neuronal effective connectivity underlying attentional bias in the CocUD subjects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35682, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
