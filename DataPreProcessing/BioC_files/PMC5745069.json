Habenular asymmetry has been shown to be behaviorally important in vertebrates. In humans, habenular RSFC has been shown to be asymmetric. However, the functional significance of this asymmetry is not clear.

By using other patients as controls and including comorbidities as covariates in the analysis, we attempted to control for the possible confounding effects of multiple diagnoses. In addition, by studying all consenting patients without excluding patients because of comorbidities when comparing user versus non-user participants, our sample arguably has higher ecological validity than the more traditional imaging approach, where a small sample of narrowly defined patients is compared to healthy controls. Our sample included comorbid diagnoses and abusers of multiple dugs. Despite this heterogeneity, opioid use was the one variable that influenced RSFC between habenula and striatal sub-regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23683, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given the small size of the habenula, comparable to the size of the functional voxel we used, it is difficult to be confident that the observed results are indeed differences in habenular connectivity. The thalamus is in close proximity and much larger than the habenula, so thalamic contamination could influence the results. Although this is a possibility, we believe it is unlikely for a number of reasons. First, the habenula is known to be (indirectly) connected to the striatum, and habenula/striatum connectivity is known to affect reward processes. Second, the habenula expresses nicotinic receptor alpha 5 subunit mRNA, which is absent in the thalamus, and mu-opioid receptors. Third, habenular resting state connectivity has been studied using a smaller voxel, and the results are qualitatively very similar to ours: Although in this manuscript we focused only on the striatum and areas known or hypothesized to be important for the habenular reward-related circuit, high habenular connectivity with thalamus, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, superior frontal gyrus, and high \"negative connectivity\" with lingual gyrus and cuneus were observed both in the Ely manuscript and in our data (not shown). We believe that only a qualitative comparison between both sets of data should be done, since there are many differences between both manuscripts, including scanner, imaging parameters, data processing, and importantly sample characteristics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25144, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A limitation of this work is the fact that we can't separate the medial from the lateral habenula at the resolution achieved in our MRI.

Furthermore, despite the relatively large number of patients analyzed, false positives and hard to replicate data are common in these types of studies. In addition, we can only speculate about causality between habenular RSFC and opioid abuse. However, we believe that the inclusion of genotypic data in imaging research moves us closer to being able to infer causality in some studies, particularly for brain regions expressing high levels of particular genes of interest.
