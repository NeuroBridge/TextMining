Although people with schizophrenia (SZ) show impaired reality monitoring, nothing is known about how mood state influences this higher-order cognitive process.

Our findings indicate that mood affected reality monitoring performance in HC and SZ participants in both similar and dissociable ways. Only a positive mood facilitated task performance in Healthy Control (HC) subjects, whereas a negative mood facilitated task performance in SZ subjects. Yet, when both HC and SZ participants were in a positive mood, they recruited medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to bias better subsequent self-generated item identification, despite the fact that mPFC signal was reduced in SZ participants. Additionally, in SZ subjects, negative mood states also modulated left and right dorsal mPFC signal to bias better externally-presented item identification.

A plethora of behavioral evidence reveals that when healthy participants are in positive mood state, they show broader attention, broader thought-action repertoires, better working memory and greater cognitive flexibility (, pp. 521\u2013539). Additional studies reveal that prefrontal regions mediating different aspects of source memory encoding and retrieval processes, and which are also activated during positive mood states may also help to predispose and facilitate overall memory recognition processes.

When HC participants perform the reality-monitoring task, they show increased activation in mPFC, which correlated with identification of self-generated information.

We, therefore, predicted that when participants were in a negative mood as compared to a neutral mood, they would activate mPFC and parahippocampal/amygdala cortices. Less is known about the neural mechanisms of how a negative mood impacts cognition; in particular, the interaction between mood induced activity in mPFC and its role in reality monitoring has never been investigated to date. However, previous research has shown that in contrast to certain cognitive-enhancing effects of a positive mood (in terms of broadening attention, memory and cognitive control), behaviorally, negative mood states such as anxiety and depression have been associated with deficits in attentional and cognitive control mechanisms. Reality-monitoring is a multifaceted process which requires components of attention, memory and cognitive control; consequently, when HC participants were in a negative mood state, we expected to find somewhat opposite effects (or null effects) of negative mood states on reality-monitoring, as compared to a positive mood. By contrast, prior research has shown that SZ participants demonstrate enhanced attention and memory recall during negative mood states and negative/ fearful stimuli.

The instructions during the mood-inducing word generation phase were: \u201cI would like you to try and come up with 30 positive words, 30 neutral words and 30 negative words that remind you of your past experiences. The words can be names of people, places and need not have to make sense to anyone else so long as it reminds you of your past experience. Neutral words consist of words that have little or no emotional meaning to your life. For example, names of objects are usually thought of as neutral (i.e., wall, paper, table, etc).

Specifically, when SZ participants were in a negative mood relative to a neutral mood state, signal within both the left and right dorsal medial prefrontal cortical signal (DMPFC) predicted better overall source-memory accuracy, as well as specifically correlating with better accurate identification of externally-presented information.

Further evidence from computational and functional neuroimaging studies posit that this dopamine release (e.g., during positive mood states) enhances mnemonic processes by protecting information from distraction via reinforcement of prefrontal-striatal/basal ganglia connections.
