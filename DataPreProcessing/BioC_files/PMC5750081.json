To date, there is increasing interest to uncover the neurocognitive mapping of specific behavioral measurement on enriched brain imaging data; hence, a supervised, goal-directed model that enables a priori information as a reference to guide multimodal data fusion is in need and a natural option. Here we proposed a fusion with reference model, called \u201cmulti-site canonical correlation analysis with reference plus joint independent component analysis\u201d (MCCAR+jICA), which can precisely identify co-varying multimodal imaging patterns closely related to reference information, such as cognitive scores. In a 3-way fusion simulation, the proposed method was compared with its alternatives on estimation accuracy of both target component decomposition and modality linkage detection. MCCAR+jICA outperforms others with higher precision. In human imaging data, working memory performance was utilized as a reference to investigate the covarying functional and structural brain patterns among 3 modalities and how they are impaired in schizophrenia. Two independent cohorts (294 and 83 subjects respectively) were used. Interestingly, similar brain maps were identified between the two cohorts, with substantial overlap in the executive control networks in fMRI, salience network in sMRI, and major white matter tracts in dMRI.

There is increasing evidence that instead of using a single imaging modality to study its relationship with physiological or cognitive features, people are paying more attention to multimodal fusion, an approach that is able to capitalize on the strength of multiple imaging techniques, since it can uncover the hidden relationships that might be missed from separate unimodal imaging studies. Compelling evidence has confirmed that neuropsychiatric disorders reflect fundamental differences in brain structure and function. By jointly analyzing rich types of data and taking advantage of the cross-information, multimodal fusion can help better reveal the potential functional-structural covariations. For example, how brain structure shapes brain function, and to what degree brain function is related to the underlying brain anatomy. Increasingly, studies are focusing on identifying the intrinsic functional or structural brain patterns that may ultimately drive a specific domain of human cognition or behavior, whereas most existing fusion models are purely data-driven. Hence in this work, we are motivated to develop a supervised multimodal fusion model that is able to discover the co-varying imaging features particularly related to a referred measurement more precisely and robustly.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3384, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Existing multivariate data-driven multimodal fusion methods have in most cases been based on blind source separation (BSS) techniques. Specifically, multi-set canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and sparse CCA maximize the inter-modality covariance across multiple data sets, thus enable the identification of the co-varying multimodal components with similar individual variabilities, but their associated spatial maps may not be sufficiently unique. Joint independent component analysis (ICA), and linked ICA perform well in spatial decomposition by maximizing the joint independence, but all modalities share a common profile. Combining the strengths of MCCA and jICA, Sui et al developed \u201cMCCA+jICA\u201d, a blind fusion algorithm, which successfully captures both multimodal interactions and spatial components at high accuracy to study brain diseases. Other data fusion approaches like independent vector analysis (IVA) generalizes ICA to multiple data sets using the mutual information rate, achieving a similar performance to MCCA+jICA.

Hence they may not be optimal when investigating the brain patterns related to a specific measure of interest. By contrast, a supervised learning model can be more goal-directed, since it takes advantage of the prior knowledge to guide the fusion analysis and is able to pinpoint a particular component of interest from a large complex dataset. One example is pICA-R (parallel ICA with reference) which used candidate genes as spatial priori to improve investigation of the relationships between brain imaging and specific genetic attributes.

There are very consistent evidences that SZ have difficulty with processes attributed to the central executive component of working memory. Two meta-analyses on working memory related brain activation in schizophrenia provide consistent evidence for altered activity in DLPFC, indicating that the link between DLPFC dysfunction and disrupted working memory is a prominent feature of leading cognitive neuroscience models of schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence also suggest working memory and the DLPFC component in particular, as a critical domain of dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In sMRI studies, the DLPFC is a key cortical region in which gray matter is reduced in volume in schizophrenia, changes that are correlated with negative symptom severity in patients. Overall, our results suggest that higher fALFF but lower GM volume in DLPFC relates to worse working memory in schizophrenia. Commonly in fMRI_IC6 and sMRI_IC6, SZ also showed lower values in thalamus, which is believed to be the mediator of attention under the notable contextual and leading influence of the neocortex. Thalamus has dense reciprocal projections with cerebral neocortex and with limbic structures, and forms a key part of the pathway for transmission of sensory information to cortex. The thalamus and the basal ganglia are key structures linked to the prefrontal cortex and are known to be involved in working memory and it also participate in the thalamic\u2013cortical\u2013striatal circuitry subserving working memory.
