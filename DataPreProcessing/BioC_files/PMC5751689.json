Converging evidence suggests schizophrenia patients are often associated with reduced activities and inappropriate activity timing around the bilateral prefrontal cortex during a verbal fluency task or other cognitive tasks. Based on these findings, some studies have attempted to apply the fNIRS signal as a diagnostic tool with different pattern recognition methods. In, authors measured the changes of the oxy-Hb signal during multiple cognitive tasks from two fNIRS channels located in the bilateral prefrontal areas and then applied stepwise linear discriminant analysis to distinguish patients with schizophrenia from healthy subjects. They separated the total sample into two groups, and each group consisted of 60 subjects (including 30 patients with schizophrenia and 30 age-and gender-matched healthy controls). The experimental results demonstrated that there was an accuracy rate of 88.3% for classification in the first group, and the discrimination function derived from the first group correctly differentiated 75% of the subjects in the second group. To integrate spatial and temporal information in multichannel fNIRS, employed a novel probabilistic pattern recognition method called Gaussian process classifier for the diagnostic classification of schizophrenia. Using the temporal patterns of fNIRS data measured during a working memory task, an overall accuracy of 76% was achieved in a group of 80 samples. And applied a 52 channel fNIRS system to identify the significantly different regions in the prefrontal cortex during a verbal fluency test and then utilized a k-means clustering method for discriminant analysis between schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects.

Thus, SVM had the good classification performance especially after performing the CBNA based feature selection.
