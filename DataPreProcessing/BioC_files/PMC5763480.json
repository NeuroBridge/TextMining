Many of these individuals have a strong desire to quit smoking; however, their quit attempts are often unsuccessful, and relapse after a short cessation period is typical. A host of factors may be involved in the motivation to smoke and the risk of relapse, including exposure to smoking reminders (cues), stress, peer pressure, availability, hormonal status and weight management. Of note, withdrawal-induced craving is cited as a major motivator for continued smoking and relapse, particularly in the early phases of smoking cessation. Withdrawal is an intense phase of smoking cessation, roused by the absence of the pharmacological effects of nicotine on its brain targets. Nicotine\u2019s terminal half-life is approximately two hours; thus, conservative estimates might place the onset of withdrawal within two hours after last smoking; however, withdrawal symptoms can emerge as early as 30 min after smoking. Withdrawal is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including anger, irritability and restlessness, anxiety, dysphoria, difficulty with focus and attention, and sleep problems including insomnia. Generally, to our knowledge, symptoms are the most severe within the first 24\u201372 h and continue for 2\u20134 weeks. Notably, most individuals who attempt to abstain from smoking lapse within the first several hours after quitting, prompting to conduct a comprehensive multi-modal assessment of early withdrawal to provide a scientific basis for the observed phenomenon.

As suggested by the available literature and the sensitization-homeostasis theory of drug addiction nicotine\u2019s indirect effects on the dopaminergic system may underlie the motivation to seek and use nicotine. When nicotine is present in the brain, it enhances dopamine release in the ventral striatum and attenuates motivation to seek drug. In contrast, when nicotine levels decline, as during abstinence, striatal dopamine levels decrease and motivation to seek and use drugs is enhanced. Although not always the case, some studies have shown that mesolimbic activation correlates with dopamine release in humans, suggesting that activation of the mesolimbic pathway may be considered a surrogate marker of dopaminergic activity. In line with the preclinical data, in human work, positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show that cigarette smoking and/or nicotine administration increases resting brain response in striatal areas and other regions of the mesolimbic system, including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, frontal lobe, and thalamus.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5002, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite the physiological and behavioral evidence for early withdrawal, all of the neuroimaging studies examining the effects of nicotine abstinence on regional resting brain response have been conducted in overnight abstinent smokers; however, studies examining other brain end points at earlier time points have been conducted. examined resting-state cingulate functional connectivity in individuals who had abstained from smoking for 4.5 h and then were administered either nicotine or placebo patch to determine the effects of acute nicotine administration on cingulate connectivity. Acute nicotine was found to enhance cingulate-neocortical functional connectivity patterns. Brain responses during a monetary incentive reward task have also been shown to differ in participants 2.5 h after smoking (a period chosen to minimize early withdrawal effects) when imaged under placebo versus nicotine patch conditions, with acute nicotine increasing activity in the dorsal striatum for anticipated magnitude of reward. Neither of these studies examined rCBF. Given the available data, we hypothesized that shorter periods of abstinence may also alter resting rCBF. Specifically, we hypothesized that 4 h of nicotine deprivation versus \u2018smoking as usual\u2019 would disrupt resting rCBF in key nodes within mesocorticolimbic circuitry.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6331, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Testing the hypothesis that 4 h of abstinence can perturb the brain is important for at least two reasons. Primarily, it will characterize the functional substrates of early withdrawal, which has not been shown previously and which may have meaningful implications for the treatment of cigarette dependence. Given that most lapses occur within hours after attempting to abstain and are motivated by the absence of nicotine in the brain, which promotes the abstinence syndrome, knowledge of the brain substrates of early withdrawal would offer a rational target for medications development. This knowledge would also be useful for the development of short-term relief medications for smokers who are not quite ready to make a quit attempt and yet who may be forbidden to smoke in the work place and in most hotels, airports, etc. For example, in the U.S., smoking is banned in most internal work environments and given that even 1 h of abstinence produced deficits in sustained attention, reductions in heart rate, and increased self-reported withdrawal symptoms, current moderate to heavy smokers are likely experiencing withdrawal symptoms during work hours, reducing their ability to attend, focus and respond appropriately to stress. Identifying the brain substrates of early abstinence is a first step in the development of effective treatments that may relieve withdrawal symptoms throughout the day, which may improve work productivity and aid smokers in their goal of quitting. Secondarily, on a practical level, if effects of abstinence can be observed in compressed time frames, many of the caveats associated with the measurement of overnight abstinence for research purposes can be minimized. For example, unequivocal overnight smoking abstinence cannot be established in an outpatient laboratory experiment. The current methods used to gauge overnight abstinence are through carbon monoxide (CO) measurements from exhaled breath or self-report. Both methods are unreliable as CO levels rapidly decrease after smoking and can fall below 10 ppm in as little as 3 h and treatment-seeking smokers are known to misrepresent their smoking status. Another caveat introduced by relying on CO levels in experimental research is a lack of standardization of time since last smoked, which could be as little as 3 h or as great as 18 h prior to obtaining a CO measurement. Failure to standardize time since last smoked can introduce noise, resulting in inaccurate reporting. Therefore, restricting the window for studying the effects of withdrawal on brain and behavioral endpoints to occur within the time constraints of a laboratory session would reduce costs and improve scientific rigor.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9023, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To test the hypothesis that brief periods of abstinence may affect brain blood flow selectively in mesocorticolimbic circuits, we used arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion fMRI to measure absolute resting rCBF in smokers when smoking as usual and following 4 h of monitored abstinence.

Our interpretation is supported by the preclinical literature, which demonstrates that nicotine administration can relieve abstinence-induced symptoms by restoring reward network function. The findings also align quite well with the human studies conducted in nicotine dependent individuals, which show that acute nicotine administration increases resting CBF in the striatal area and thalamus and dopamine release within subregions of the striatum including the ventral striatum.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26821, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "rCBF in both lateral and medial OFC nodes was reduced by 4-h abstinence although it did not survive the correction for multiple corrections. Task-related functional neuroimaging and clinical neuropsychological studies have provided evidence that the human orbitofrontal cortex is an important brain region for the processing of rewards and punishments, with subregional neuroanatomical specificity regarding processing the value, evaluation of consequences, and complexity of rewards. Evolutionary success is dependent on the elasticity and flexibility of the orbitofrontal cortex to rapidly modify behavior to fit changeable internal and external environments. Here, we show that as few as 4 h of nicotine deprivation can dampen resting brain blood flow to this crucial structure, suggesting that even short periods of nicotine deprivation may affect decision making capabilities in chronic nicotine dependent individuals. Although the lack of a strong effect in this region may suggest that inter-individual variability may be at play and replication of this finding is important before any firm conclusions can be drawn.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27945, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.4.

However, nicotine dependence was not shown to be associated with the degree of disruption in the current study, which may be attributed to attempting to align a trait-like measure (i.e., FTND) with a considerably shortened state-dependent deprivation window of 4 h.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28534, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "General desire to smoke (i.e., craving) can be altered by state (i.e., smoking as usual versus deprived), as was shown in the present study, and is a strong predictor of relapse. The magnitude of the change in craving from SMK to ABS conditions was strongly associated with the magnitude of disrupted rCBF in regions that showed reductions in neural activity across conditions such as the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. Note that this is not a negative association with craving and neural activity, but reflects greater changes in craving when the change in rCBF between SMK and ABS conditions is greater. Other regions also showed strong associations, including the left anterior ventral insula, which has been repeatedly shown to be associated with craving cigarettes during cigarette cue exposure; albeit, to our knowledge, this is the first time resting brain blood flow change from smoking to abstinent conditions in the anterior ventral insula has been shown to correlate with cigarette craving. The association between the magnitude of change in craving in non-treatment seekers and the degree of resting rCBF change in key mesocorticolimbic nodes shown here is an important and novel finding and suggests that altered reward network homeostasis in abstinent smokers may contribute to smoking relapse, although that remains untested. Conceivably, contemporary medicine could benefit from utilizing resting state fMRI measures on an individualized basis as a tool to identify the \u2018precise strategy\u2019 (ie., type and dose of medication, behavioral intervention) that restores reward network function in smokers. However, issues related to MRI costs and access to an MRI scanning facility render this an impractical strategy in the current climate. Other fields (e.g., depression) are linking brain findings to clinical outcomes and treatment response, catapulting treatment research into the 21 st century. Within the addiction field, we have only just begun to synch the two areas of research. Published studies exist that demonstrate brain anomalies in addiction and there are hundreds of clinical trials testing behavioral and pharmacological interventions; however, the two efforts have not been integrated on a scale that would offer stable, generalizable results to guide new treatments or determine the effects of available treatments on the brain. The \u201cseparate, but parallel\u201d research efforts of brain imaging teams and clinical outcome research groups is, at one level, understandable. Both avenues of research are expensive and require highly skilled multi-disciplinary collaborations. However, effectively integrating these research efforts is necessary to improve the scientific yield and health benefits offered by both approaches. With each passing year, technological advances and dedicated researchers are bringing us closer to the goal of demonstrating the clinical significance of neuroimaging research \u2013 a tool that will inform clinicians and assist in personalized treatments for addiction (i.e., Precision Medicine). A long-term goal for the field of addiction is to provide a brain-based understanding of relapse vulnerability and hallmarks of recovery \u2013 an understanding that may transform addiction treatment strategies and permanently diminish high relapse rates. At this stage in time, we can, at the very least, utilize the knowledge gleaned from neuroimaging to account for the underlying neurobiology associated with a behavioral manifestation to predict treatment response in behavioral phenotypes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32079, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.5.

show reduced resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in several brain regions, particularly the hippocampus. Compared to the SMK condition, a paired t-test showed that 4 h of abstinence (ABS) induced significantly reduced rCBF in several regions. The strongest finding was observed in the hippocampus, bilaterally with peaks extending into the mid-brain, posterior cingulate, ventral striatum and occipital cortex. Other regions of decreased rCBF included the middle frontal cortex, the middle temporal gyrus and the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices (See Table 2 for significance values and peak coordinates). There were no regions that showed greater rCBF in the ABS versus SMK condition. Axial slices are shown from z = \u2212 22 to z = 2.
