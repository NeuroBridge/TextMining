Previous research has reported both hyper- and hypo-connectivity within the DMN, and both increased and decreased DMN coupling with the multi-modal saliency network (SN) and dorsal attention network (DAN). The present study systematically revisited network disruption in patients with schizophrenia using data-derived network atlases and multivariate pattern-learning algorithms in a multi-site dataset (n=325). Resting-state fluctuations in unconstrained brain states were used to estimate functional connectivity, and local volume differences between individuals were used to estimate structural co-occurrence within and between the DMN, SN, and DAN. In brain structure and function, sparse inverse covariance estimates of network structure were used to characterize healthy and patients with schizophrenia groups, and to identify statistically significant group differences. Evidence did not confirm that the backbone of the DMN was the primary driver of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia. Instead, functional and structural aberrations were frequently located outside of the DMN core, such as in the anterior temporoparietal junction and precuneus. Additionally, functional covariation analyses highlighted dysfunctional DMN-DAN coupling, while structural covariation results highlighted aberrant DMN-SN coupling.

B The DMN nodes are subdivided into 12 ROIs accounting for the distinct subnodes in the DMN that were recently established. According to this prior work, the functional core of the DMN (\u201cDMN proper\u201d) likely corresponds especially to its blue and red subnodes (the ventral and the dorsal PCCs, the left and right posterior TPJs, and the rostroventral and rostrodorsal DMPFC). C The DMN subnodes are supplemented by 9 ROIs for the dorsal attention network (DAN, light green) and saliency network (SN, purple), drawn from published quantitative meta-analyses. The DAN was composed of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) bilaterally. The SN included the midcingulate cortex (MCC) and the bilateral anterior insula (AI) as well as amygdala (AM).

A The covariance matrix was computed with brain signals extracted from the DMN atlas. Each entry in this matrix indicates the linear relationship of each specific pair of target DMN nodes.

In contrast to the covariance matrix, the precision matrix captures the multiple relations between each of the pairs of target nodes while conditioning on the potential influence from the respective other nodes. C The sparse precision matrix was computed by sparse inverse covariance estimation with sparsity constraint. The additional modeling constraint improves interpretability by automatically reducing the network graph to the important network edges (non-zero strength, red or blue) and ignoring the irrelevant ones (zero strength, white). D The sparse precision matrices were computed separately in healthy controls and schizophrenic patients. Statistically significant group differences in coupling strengths (brown squares) were determined by non-parametric hypothesis testing.
