They unfold automatically and unconsciously and are seamlessly integrated with cognitive control which is mobilized by stimuli that evoke ambiguity or response conflict. Methods with high spatio-temporal sensitivity are needed to provide insight into the interplay between automatic and controlled processing. This study used anatomically-constrained MEG to examine the underlying neural dynamics in a flanker task that manipulated S-R incongruity at the stimulus (SI) and response levels (RI). Though irrelevant, flankers evoked automatic preparation of motor plans which had to be suppressed and reversed following the target presentation on RI trials. Event-related source power estimates in beta (15\u201325 Hz) frequency band in the sensorimotor cortex tracked motor preparation and response in real time and revealed switching from the incorrectly-primed to the correctly-responding hemisphere. In contrast, theta oscillations (4\u20137 Hz) were sensitive to the levels of incongruity as the medial and ventrolateral frontal cortices were especially activated by response conflict. These two areas are key to cognitive control and their integrated contributions to response inhibition and switching were revealed by phase-locked co-oscillations. These processes were pharmacologically manipulated with a moderate alcohol beverage or a placebo administered to healthy social drinkers. Alcohol selectively decreased accuracy to response conflict. It strongly attenuated theta oscillations during decision making and partly re-sculpted relative contributions of the frontal network without affecting the motor switching process subserved by beta band. Our results indicate that motor preparation is initiated automatically even when counterproductive but that it is monitored and regulated by the prefrontal cognitive control processes under conflict.

The regulative control network then determines the most adaptive course of action and it activates the motor system to execute the selected motor action (\u201coutput\u201d). However, extensive evidence calls into question a clear distinction in timing between sensory and motor systems suggesting that these processing streams proceed largely automatically and in a parallel and interdependent manner. Some accounts propose that motor preparation of the voluntary muscles commences early during perceptual processing, once the sensory analysis delineates a possible range of motor actions most likely to be relevant in that context. This preparatory activity is automatic and not accessible to conscious experience yet it seems to underlie a significant portion of our behavior. This view is inconsistent with our subjective experience of being in control of our actions, which we perceive as being fully voluntary and deliberate. Indeed, automatic processing is contrasted with cognitive control, which refers to the capacity to monitor environmental demands and flexibly select goal-directed actions. It is an executive function, it is under conscious control, and it is primarily engaged when we encounter stimuli that are ambiguous or that evoke incompatible response tendencies. It is subserved by an interactive network that primarily includes medial and lateral prefrontal and lateral parietal cortices that seem to play overlapping and only partially distinct roles. Cognitive control is typically studied with tasks contrasting different levels of response incompatibility. It comprises detection of incongruity, employment of top-down control to decide between multiple options, inhibition of a dominant and automatic but task-irrelevant response, and execution of the most adaptive and goal relevant action. Even though automatic processing underlies a large portion of our daily routines, it is seamlessly integrated with cognitive control that allows conscious override of the automatically planned motor sequences resulting in flexible behavior. A variety of methods have been used to examine the physiological underpinnings of cognitive control and the associated temporal stages. Nonetheless, the spatio-temporal stages of the interplay of automatic and controlled processing are still poorly understood. In an effort to contribute to this line of research, the current study uses a temporally sensitive method to track neural activity in real time during processing of incongruent trials that induce conflict on perceptual vs. motor levels. This approach makes it possible to examine the interplay between automatically generated motor plans and ad hoc executed response reversals indexing cognitive control.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5241, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The structure of the flanker task presents an opportunity to study the neural basis of different dimensions of incongruity processing with an emphasis on cognitive control over simultaneously activated, competing motor plans. Different task forms have been used extensively in fMRI and ERP studies. The color task version used in the current study presents irrelevant flanker squares in one of four colors on both sides of a central target square. The target is shown after a short delay and participants are instructed to ignore the flankers and respond to the color of the target. Because two different colors are mapped on each hand, the conflict between flankers and targets is manipulated in two ways. At the stimulus incongruity (SI) level, the two colors are perceptually different but they both map to the same hand and do not necessitate a change of response. At the response incongruity (RI) level, the flankers prime an incorrect response which must be switched to the correctly-responding hand following the target appearance. Both conflict conditions can be compared to congruous (CO) trials on which flankers and the target are the same color. The incongruity effect is further facilitated in the current study by displaying the flankers alone for a short period of time just before the target. Previous evidence shows that accuracy is lowest and response times longest to RI trials confirming that response interference is greater than the perceptual interference. Imaging evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) but also pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) are activated during response interference, in addition to lateral ventral and dorsal frontal areas. This pattern is consistent with other types of tasks eliciting response conflict such as the Stroop and error processing as this network is engaged during cognitive control tasks probing conflict detection and response selection.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7210, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Functional imaging provides spatial mapping of the involved areas but techniques with higher temporal precision that can resolve different stages of processing are needed to examine on-line activity changes during cognitive control engagement. Studies using EEG and MEG methods have investigated the oscillatory dynamics of movement preparation and the cognitive control influences as they unfold during conflict-evoking conditions. Imagined or actual engagement of the motor circuitry is reflected in oscillatory activity within beta frequency band (15\u201325 Hz). Beta power decrease, also termed desynchronization, is observed during movement initiation and execution and during imagined movements. Beta decrease is generated bilaterally in the sensorimotor cortices with dominance contralateral to movement. This asymmetry has been exploited successfully in brain-computer interface systems. Lateralized beta decrease measured over the sensorimotor areas in the two hemispheres is anticipatory in nature. It commences well in advance of a motor action and is predictive of the upcoming movement. Cheyne and colleagues used a go/switch task which established response prevalence on the majority of trials and required a response switch on a subset of trials. Using MEG source modeling, they reported sensitivity of beta decrease to the laterality of response preparation to correct and erroneous switches. These features make beta oscillations well suited for investigating involuntary motor preparation induced by the presentation of flankers and the controlled override during deliberate motor decisions.

Source modeling of MEG and EEG signal indicates that the ACC is a strong generator of theta during response conflict with additional sources reported in the lateral prefrontal cortex. These estimates are consistent with intracranial recordings during cognitive tasks. MEG studies investigating response stopping and switching have reported theta activity in the right anterior frontal cortex during both conflict conditions, suggesting that it subserves cognitive control more broadly. In a MEG study, McDermott and colleagues used an arrow-based flanker task and reported an increase in theta synchronization in brain regions subserving cognitive control. Even though theta reflects different aspects of conflict in the response domain including response inhibition, selection, and action monitoring, it is not clear whether this extends to conflict in the stimulus processing as well. This was addressed by Nigbur and colleagues who used a letter version of the flanker task in an EEG study. They reported event-related theta increase to both perceptual and response-related incompatibility. In addition, they calculated theta phase synchrony between electrodes over the medial and lateral fronto-central scalp regions and observed increased theta coupling during trials inducing response conflict.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10436, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The question of automatic vs. controlled processing is particularly germane to addiction. Animal research and human studies indicate that the circuits underlying cognitive control are especially vulnerable to addiction including alcoholism. Long term excessive alcohol use is associated with compromised structural and functional circuitry primarily in the frontal lobes resulting in dysregulation of cognitive functions. In a series of previous studies, we have reported that alcohol intoxication selectively attenuates cognitive control, which is engaged during high levels of response conflict. In a BOLD fMRI study, we found that the ACC activity to high conflict trials on a Stroop task is selectively reduced under acute alcohol intoxication. In a MEG study with the same task, Kovacevic et al. found that alcohol reduced conflict-related theta activity in the ACC during early conflict detection, and late response selection stages. Moreover, similar effects have been observed across different tasks and motor effectors, and corroborated with complementary imaging methods. This deficit may underlie inability to maintain inhibitory control over harmful levels of drinking which is considered to be a factor in subsequent alcohol abuse. However, it is not clear whether alcohol effects are specific to response conflict or whether they can be explained with attentional deficits in the stimulus-processing stream. Indeed, even relatively low alcohol doses lead to attentional impairments which are reflected in deficient novelty detection. Bartholow and colleagues recorded ERPs during a flanker task in participants that were given placebo, low (0.4 g/kg) or high (0.8 g/kg) alcohol dose. They concluded that alcohol primarily impaired response inhibition but that the lower dose affected allocation of attention. However, the ERPs did not provide insight into spatial aspects of activity.

A direct comparison of beta power between the two hemispheres referred to as \u201clateralized beta power\u201d (Fig 4) was inspired by studies of lateralized readiness potential (LRP), an index of hemispheric asymmetry over the sensorimotor cortex during motor preparation. EEG studies measuring LRP in flanker tasks find that RI trials initially activate an incorrect response which is then appropriately switched on correct trials. Automatic initiation of motor plans has been confirmed with lateralized response fields in MEG studies using a go/switch paradigm by Cheyne and colleagues who showed that beta suppression over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex reflects anticipatory activity and is predictive of correct motor preparation. Studies using EMG recordings of hand muscles confirm subthreshold activation of motor responses that are suppressed prior to the actual execution. Indeed, in the present study, direct comparison of the relative beta power recorded over the left and the right sensorimotor regions revealed that the incorrect motor preparation decreases simultaneously with increasing of the correct motor activation. This is consistent with a gradual tradeoff in motor excitability between the two hemispheres as shown in studies combining stimulation and electrical recordings of brain and muscle activity.

The parallel processing of automatic versus instructed behavior extends to other domains and reflects the generality of the brain\u2019s cognitive control networks in responding to diverse aspects of motor processing. It has been demonstrated in numerous studies probing a range of functions including oculomotor control, and object affordance. Application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) along with ERPs and MEPs has provided complementary evidence on changes in motor excitability and the relative timing of engagement of cognitive control and switching of response plans. Furthermore, studies of language indicate that words automatically trigger generic processing for meaning as it is impossible to decide not to understand a familiar word in one\u2019s own language. Therefore, most stimuli that we encounter activate relevant generic processing streams without conscious input. However, motor plans are monitored continuously in the context of changing environmental demands and can be modified in an integrated manner by regulative, anticipatory mechanisms. This proactive action framework has several advantages: advanced motor preparation assures primed and therefore faster responses especially under predominantly predictable circumstances; it comprises a range of motor actions or affordances that are situationally possible; motor plan modifications are smooth and integrated with a wider framework; furthermore, it is faster to initiate the most likely motor response in advance and make corrections as needed than to start motor preparations after a stimulus has been processed. Therefore, along with other evidence, our findings support a broader ecological view of behavior which proposes that the motor preparation is triggered automatically and largely unconsciously,in a manner that is intertwined with input evaluation and is inherent to behavioral actions.

In a series of studies we have shown that the regulative top-down functions are particularly vulnerable to acute alcohol intoxication including the Stroop interference, saccadic conflict, a modified Simon task, a color flanker task, and error processing. Behavioral results indicate that alcohol has particularly deleterious effects on response conflict, consistent with previous reports. The aMEG model used in the present study is particularly suitable for investigating neuropsychopharmacological effects of alcohol, because MEG reflects the neural activity directly and is not susceptible to the confound of vasodilatory effects of alcohol which may affect the BOLD signal. The present study indicates that the effects of alcohol on beta oscillations are rather subtle and generalized and are not dependent on response conflict. Alcohol did not affect the motor switching process which was analogous for both beverage conditions in its timing and amplitude. However, beta power decrease was less pronounced under alcohol overall which reflects its inhibitory effects via facilitation of the GABAA receptor function. A similar effect of weaker beta desynchronization in motor areas was found in a MEG study in which a benzodiazepine was administered to healthy adults. It is known that benzodiazepines are also GABAA agonists and that they show cross-tolerance with alcohol, indicating that they affect common mechanisms.

It is seamlessly integrated with automatic processing as it tracks cognitive demands and is engaged proactively in situations involving ambiguity or indicating a need for response override. In the present study, the primary generators of theta were estimated to the medial prefrontal cortex including preSMA and ACC, in the ventrolateral frontal cortex (IFC), and in the sensorimotor cortex (Fig 5). These spatial estimates are consistent with previous findings from other executive tasks such as the Stroop or a modified Simon task obtained with this method as well as with fMRI studies and intracranial EEG recordings. Under placebo, theta power estimated to motor regions including the preSMA and SMOT was greater to both types of incongruity indicating that these regions are primarily concerned with motor intention and execution, but do not seem to be involved in the delineation of stimulus vs response incongruity. In contrast, the IFC and the ACC responded preferentially to response incongruity under placebo. Both of these areas are known to play essential roles in a predominantly prefrontal cognitive control network during response conflict and the decision of how to respond seems to be addressed by these regions. IFC activation has been associated with planning internally driven movements which supports its essential contribution to maintenance of rule representation and action inhibition and selection. A recent MEG study further showed importance of the IFC for coordinating long-range connections necessary for visuo-motor integration during a precision grip task. Its activity is coupled with that in the ACC which may subserve efforts to execute actions in agreement with intents and goals and which is sensitive to both early and late conflict processing stages and motor preparation. The present data suggest that the IFC and ACC play a key role in the effective cancellation of automatically initiated but incorrect motor plans and executing adjustments to maintain performance accuracy. However, while alcohol challenge abolished the IFC sensitivity to response incongruity, theta increase to RI trials was preserved in the ACC under alcohol. This suggests that the ACC in particular subserves response incongruity which is consistent with its key role in movement planning and selection. Similarly, under alcohol, the neighboring pre-SMA area maintained sensitivity to response incongruity only. The pre-SMA has been implicated in conflict-related activity and in initiating voluntary, intentional actions especially under situations demanding more complex control. The observed changes in regional sensitivity to response conflict under alcohol challenge suggests that the network may be slightly re-sculpted with increased contribution by the pre-SMA to action selection. This is consistent with previous studies implicating the pre-SMA in response selection, programming, and implementing task rules. It is known that alcohol intoxication increases cognitive demands during conflict tasks and may necessitate additional resources to comply with task requirements. Therefore, the increased sensitivity of the pre-SMA to response conflict during alcohol challenge could reflect its compensatory activation to countervail alcohol-induced degradation of the cognitive control network.

The cortico-limbic and cortico-cortical interactions are necessary for integrating plans and actions and for the top-down regulative input. In an effort to examine how the principal activated areas interact in real time and at the level of a system, we calculated phase locking values (PLV) on single trials. PLV is a measure of co-oscillations based on the phase similarity in a particular frequency range between two ROIs regardless of their amplitudes. PLV increases transiently at times when it may be expected that different brain locations interact. Importance of the connection between the lateral and the medial prefrontal cortices for successful performance on tasks evoking cognitive control is well established and is supported by their neuroanatomical connections. The network-based view proposes that behavioral inhibition is an emergent property of an interactive network rather than being subserved by a single module. As shown in Fig 6, the right prefrontal cortex (IFC) co-oscillates with the motor cortex and preSMA in a manner sensitive to both levels of conflict which aligns with its importance for long-range coordination. The PLV was greater on RI trials at the time of response, suggesting that theta interactions underlie response reversal consistent with previous reports. However, the network interactions are dysregulated by alcohol. This indicates that the fine tuning of the distributed neuronal envelopes that relies on the excitatory-inhibitory balance is disturbed by alcohol\u2019s pharmacological effects. Alcohol-related wideband reductions in phase-locking have also been shown in both rats and humans during an auditory oddball task.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 55258, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In sum, by resolving the multiplexed MEG signal into beta and theta bands, we were able to examine the interplay between automatic and controlled processing during a flanker task. Hemispheric laterality of beta band changes in response to flankers and subsequent targets made it possible to track switching of response hands in real time. In contrast, theta oscillations estimated to medial and lateral prefrontal cortex were induced by both types of incongruity. The ACC and IFC were particularly sensitive to response incongruity, indicating their involvement in response inhibition and switching under placebo. Alcohol dysregulated this pattern and resulted in a shift towards greater activity of the pre-SMA during response conflict, while ACC remained sensitive to response incongruity across both beverages. Beta desynchronization was reduced under alcohol overall in agreement with alcohol-induced enhancement of inhibitory signaling. However, alcohol did not affect switching process. This type of research can have potential applications in further refinement of brain-machine interfacing for the purpose of using these indices for fluid decoding of automatic motor planning and moment-to-moment changes in cognitive control of intended motion.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 56512, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supporting information", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 56535, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 56546, "infons": {"name_0": "surname:Fodor;given-names:JA", "section_type": "REF", "type": "ref", "year": "1983"}, "text": "", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 56547, "infons": {"fpage": "3", "issue": "1", "lpage": "65", "name_0": "surname:Meyer;given-names:DE", "name_1": "surname:Kieras;given-names:DE", "pub-id_pmid": "9009880", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Psychol Rev", "type": "ref", "volume": "104", "year": "1997"}, "text": "A computational theory of executive cognitive processes and multiple-task performance: Part 1.
