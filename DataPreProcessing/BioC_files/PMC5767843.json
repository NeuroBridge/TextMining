The principal goal of this study was to examine blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation to high- and low-concentration sweet solutions in subjects who are either positive (FHP) or negative (FHN) for a family history of alcoholism. Seventy-four non-treatment seeking, community-recruited, healthy volunteers (22.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 SD years; 43% men) rated a range of sucrose concentrations in a taste test and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during oral delivery of water, 0.83\u00a0M, and 0.10\u00a0M sucrose. Sucrose compared to water produced robust activation in primary gustatory cortex, ventral insula, amygdala, and ventral striatum. FHP subjects displayed greater bilateral amygdala activation than FHN subjects in the low sucrose concentration (0.10\u00a0M). In secondary analyses, the right amygdala response to the 0.10\u00a0M sucrose was greatest in FHP women. When accounting for group differences in drinks per week, the family history groups remained significantly different in their right amygdala response to 0.10\u00a0M sucrose.

A number of animal studies show that the preference for alcohol and other drugs of abuse is accompanied by a greater preference for sweetened stimuli. This relationship is genetically based, as animals bred for saccharin preference self-administer abused drugs more than their non-preferring littermates. Similarly, rodents bred for alcohol preference exhibit a greater preference for sweetened solutions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2648, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Some evidence also suggests that humans who abuse drugs, including alcohol, have a greater preference for highly sweet solutions (e.g.,). All such alcohol-related studies presented subjects with a range of molar (M) sucrose concentrations, most commonly in five solutions between a low of 0.05\u00a0M and peak of 0.83\u00a0M. An individual is then typically defined as a \u201csweet-liker\u201d when his or her visual analog scale liking ratings are greatest at the highest (0.83\u00a0M) concentration, which is greater than the original criterion of 0.3\u00a0M established by. For context, 0.83\u00a0M sucrose equates to approximately 2.5 times the sweetness of Coca Cola Classic\u00ae (Coca Cola Company, Atlanta, GA). Applying this sweet-liking classification method, studies in middle-aged men show that there are a greater proportion of \u201csweet-likers\u201d in those treated for alcohol dependence when compared to non-dependent controls. Greater alcohol-related problems in non-dependent men and women college students have also been associated with being a sweet-liker. Nonetheless, two studies using similar methods and peak concentrations with comparably middle age men following alcoholism treatment have not replicated the association between alcohol dependence and sweet-liking status. One of these negative studies also included concentration ranges of bitter, sour, and salty tastants that could have changed the nature of the taste test. A third study that did not replicate the association between alcohol dependence and sweet-liking status (in both men and women) had patients that were significantly older (mean 48\u00a0years) than the controls (mean 26\u00a0years). These non-replicating studies also involved fewer sucrose concentrations, but this seems an unlikely explanation of the discordant findings insofar as the highest concentration (0.88\u00a0M) was quite comparable to the other studies' definitions of sweet-liking (i.e., peak liking at 0.83\u00a0M).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4565, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Still, other data persist in suggesting a potential relationship between sweet-liking and alcoholism risk. Half of the variance in sweet preference is accounted for by genetic factors. In that regard, several studies suggest that being a sweet-liker (again, as defined by liking ratings that peak at 0.83\u00a0M or 0.88\u00a0M) is more prevalent in those with a family history of alcoholism. Such findings suggest that sweet liking might then be an endophenotype (a hereditary characteristic associated with a condition, but not a direct symptom) for alcoholism risk. For example, one study found that a mixed sample of middle-aged male and female psychiatric and substance abuse patients with a family history of alcoholism were several times more likely to prefer stronger sweet solutions than family history negative patients, although sweet liking alone in this population is not per se predictive of diagnosed alcohol use disorder. For example, the association between sweet liking and familial alcoholism has also been found in healthy college students without any history of a substance abuse diagnoses. The manifestation of this sweet preference in the absence of a diagnosed alcohol use disorder is important, as it may speak to a genetically linked endophenotype that is independent of a drug use disorder, itself. This parallels the sucrose preferences of alcohol-preferring animal lines, even prior to alcohol exposure. Some specific genetic polymorphisms may also be relevant, as the Taq 1A polymorphism of the ANKK-1 gene might affect sweet preference in alcoholics. It should nevertheless be noted that other research does not support a link between sweet preference and familial alcoholism. One of the negative studies was age imbalanced (controls in their mid-twenties vs familial alcoholism in the upper 40's), whereas another involved subjects that were significantly younger (teens averaging 14\u201315) when compared to positive studies of young and older adults. The study defined sweet liking as comprising peak liking at either 0.42\u00a0M or 0.83\u00a0M, but this was not a problem with this same group's follow-up study that used the 0.83\u00a0M peak liking criterion, and which also did not replicate the sweet-liking association with familial alcoholism.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6818, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Apart from the conflicted findings of the psychophysical studies described above, a significant gap in our understanding of the relationship between sweet taste and substance abuse lies in the extent to which the brain's reward system response to sweet taste varies as a function of alcohol use or familial alcoholism.

In a small preliminary study, we showed that orbitofrontal cortex activation to a highly sweet sucrose solution (0.83\u00a0M) positively correlated with alcohol intake, although sample size did not permit examining the influence of familial alcoholism.

In addition, multiple studies observe insula activation to cue-induced drug craving (for review see,), including activation to alcohol cues in alcohol dependent individuals (e.g.,). More recently, greater inhibition-related insula activity was observed in FHP men performing a go/no-go task.

The trend-level effect in gustatory insula became even more insignificant. This does indicate that drinking may contribute somewhat to the family history effect. Nevertheless, a true disentangling of the effects of a family history of alcoholism and drinking is likely complex, as epidemiological evidence indicates that familial alcoholism is associated with greater drinking in the population at large. This epidemiological observation also corresponds with long-known findings that familial alcoholism may also be associated with an innate tolerance to alcohol's subjective adverse effects. Thus, both drinking levels and familial alcoholism likely travel together in practice and contribute jointly, such that a covariate adjustment might not best represent the associations. A larger sample is likely needed to form subgroups of family history positive individuals that differ in drinking. This said, neither of the drinking covariates were themselves significantly associated with BOLD activation to either sucrose concentration, which does not replicate our prior observation in a much smaller sample of a positive association of drinking and lateral orbital activation to 0.83\u00a0M sucrose.

Subjective taste ratings did not clearly correspond with drinking or FHA in the manner previously suggested by at least some studies, with our data being more in line with the prior negative findings. This said, in-scanner sweet liking ratings (where stimulation was more sustained) were higher in FHP men across both solutions.

First, the sample is not evenly divided between men and women. Though unlikely given the still large number of men, the increased differential activation observed only in FHP women could result from this imbalance. Moreover, the family history by sex interaction in the amygdala seems to have been most driven by activation in FHP women and deactivation in the other groups. As this current sample represents findings from the first half of this ongoing study, we hope to clarify these aspects, as well as replicate the current findings in the second half of the sample by using these results to predict the location of effects in the second half of the study. While a high concentration of sucrose might be expected to elicit greater activation in FHP subjects, the 0.83\u00a0M concentration may have led to a \u201cceiling effect\u201d in the brain's response, with the gustatory, reward, and salience response being saturated by a solution approximately 2.5 times the sweetness of Coca-Cola Classic\u00ae. This may explain why we observed activation that varied by familial history only at the low concentration. Future work should then consider more intermediate concentrations. Our chosen sample of individuals who do not meet the criteria of an alcohol use disorder may also be considered a limitation, as social drinkers with a family history of alcoholism may possess protective factors that shield them from an alcohol use disorder. It is possible that, if such protective factors exist, they may also alter sweet preference in these individuals. However, Kampov-Polevoy has demonstrated that this increased sweet preference can be shown in non-alcoholics with a familial history of alcoholism (e.g.,). Another potential limitation is the uneven balance of prior depression/anxiety, as well as, nicotine use as both are more prevalent in the FHP group. However, there was no behavioral evidence that prior diagnosis of depression/anxiety had any effect, and nicotine use did not significantly alter taste sensitivity as measured by the taste test procedure. Finally, a sweet taste is both inherently rewarding, but also capable of cephalic phase digestive processes and stimulating urges to eat.
