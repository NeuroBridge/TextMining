Yet the neural mechanism underlying the breakdown of verbal information processing in schizophrenia is poorly understood. Imaging studies in healthy populations have shown a network of brain areas involved in hierarchical processing of verbal information over time. Here, we identified critical aspects of this hierarchy, examining patients with schizophrenia. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined various levels of information comprehension elicited by naturally presented verbal stimuli; from a set of randomly shuffled words to an intact story. Specifically, patients with first episode schizophrenia (N\u00a0=\u00a015), their non-manifesting siblings (N\u00a0=\u00a014) and healthy controls (N\u00a0=\u00a015) listened to a narrated story and randomly scrambled versions of it. To quantify the degree of dissimilarity between the groups, we adopted an inter-subject correlation (inter-SC) approach, which estimates differences in synchronization of neural responses within and between groups. The temporal topography found in healthy and siblings groups were consistent with our previous findings \u2013 high synchronization in responses from early sensory toward high order perceptual and cognitive areas. In patients with schizophrenia, stimuli with short and intermediate temporal scales evoked a typical pattern of reliable responses, whereas story condition (long temporal scale) revealed robust and widespread disruption of the inter-SCs. In addition, the more similar the neural activity of patients with schizophrenia was to the average response in the healthy group, the less severe the positive symptoms of the patients.

Various studies have reported deficits in both language production and language comprehension. For example, a study in patients with schizophrenia showed that manipulations with discourse coherence resulted in greater impairment in processing stories relative to healthy controls, although, using a sentence continuation task, did not reveal behavioral differences between patients and controls. Another study further showed that the semantic deficits were mostly found in patients with positive symptoms of thought disturbance (, but see). It is important to note, that language deficits in schizophrenia underlie the major symptoms of psychosis, specifically hallucinations (verbal, auditory) and disorganized language output (positive thought disorder). Accordingly, a series of neurocognitive theories have proposed that clinical symptoms in schizophrenia reflect internal speech, or thinking in words, as one of the self-disturbances of the disease. More recently,, using synonym identification and sentence comprehension tasks, found that patients with schizophrenia made more errors relative to healthy controls in sentence comprehension but not with words, when the structure of the sentence was modified.

Previous neuroimaging research of semantic processing in scizophrenia has focused mainly on abnormalities in specific brain regions. For example, demonstrated that patients compared to controls failed to recruit the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial frontal and parietal cortices in their responses to incongruous versus congruous or to concrete versus abstract sentences.

Yet, the neural underpinnings of such complex contextual sensitivity in schizophrenia is not well understood. proposed a model portraying schizophrenia as a disorder of hierarchical temporal processing. Namely, the researchers suggested that the problem exists at the level of communication between cortical layers; difficulty with the formation and storage of invariant representation at higher hierarchical levels disrupts capacity of these levels and, accordingly, their ability to provide sufficient input to lower levels. In turn, lower levels are forced to transmit the details of the input to higher levels for interpretation.

In addition, we characterized a group of non-manifesting siblings of patients with schizophrenia as a separate experimental group. There were several reasons to examine the siblings of patients as a separate group. First, cognitive information processing difficulties are seen in high-risk children and unaffected family members, suggesting an inherited origin for this cognitive deficiency. Siblings, albeit to a lesser degree than patients, present with difficulties on a wide array of cognitive tasks, including working memory tasks, attention, language and facial expression recognition. This is one of the pieces of evidence for the genetic basis of neuropsychological disturbances occurring in schizophrenia. In general, according to elementary information processing, spatial working memory, and verbal memory may be candidates for cognitive endophenotypes in schizophrenia.

Thus, low-level similarity across patients observed in the DLPFC, a central player known to be deficient in schizophrenia during cognitive tasks, might be attributed to this general effect. Here we showed that such an effect was related to processing the most complex level of verbal stimuli (i.e. a whole story). A leading explanation for this decreased synchronization is a large variability among patients related to abnormal/disorganized activity or functional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex when listening to the whole story. Regarding activity, the design of the current study did not allow for direct investigation of differences in activation profiles during stimuli with different time scales. Further studies manipulating semantic information processing elements should be conducted to examine the amplitude of neural responses in detail. The possibility of reduced functional connectivity patterns with the prefrontal cortex is supported by brain \u2013 behavior models of schizophrenia which proposed that the cognitive deficits reflect disturbances in cortico-cortical (e.g., \u2018prefrontal\u2013medial temporal lobe\u2019) and cortico-subcortical (e.g., \u2018prefrontal\u2013basal ganglia\u2013thalamic\u2019) connections.

A similar relationship between precuneus functioning and the positive symptoms score of patients with first-episode psychosis has been recently reported by. It is interesting to note that the DMN, a main network for rest-related activity, plays a special role in mind-wandering, a spontaneous, uncontrolled internally-oriented condition. Neural activity in the regions that comprise substantial elements of the DMN has been demonstrated to occur during a process of self-oriented mentation in numerous studies. In addition, involvement of mental imagery in schizophrenia as a source of increased activation in the precuneus has been discussed in previous fMRI studies, which investigated cartoon jokes in individuals with enhanced risk of schizophrenia, comprehension of the figurative meaning of language, such as metaphor or verbal humor in patients with schizophrenia.
