Previously, task-based fMRI and resting-state EEG studies have revealed that craving, a critical component of addiction, is linked to abnormal activity in cortical regions including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), etc. In this study, we combine these two imaging techniques to investigate a group of alcohol-addicted patients and provide convergent evidence for the neural correlates of craving not only in alcohol but substance abuse in general. We observe abnormal BOLD signal levels in the dACC, NAcc, pgACC, PCC, amygdala, and parahippocampus (PHC) in a cue-reactivity fMRI experiment. These findings are consistent with increased beta-band activity in the dACC and pgACC in resting-state EEG. We further observe desynchronization characterized by decreased functional connectivity in cue-based fMRI and hypersynchronization characterized by increased functional connectivity between these regions in the theta frequency band. The results of our study show a consistent pattern of alcohol craving elicited by external cues and internal desires. Given the advantage of superior spatial and temporal resolution, we hypothesize a \u201ccentral craving network\u201d that integrates the different aspects of alcohol addiction into a unified percept.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1517, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1530, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Alcohol consumption is a global phenomenon characterized by its pleasurable effects in social and personal settings. Physiologically, alcohol consumption is guided by the motivational incentive of the substance controlled by the mesolimbic pathway involving mainly the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). People will generally drink alcohol for two reasons: (a) to feel better (reward drinking), or (b) not to feel bad (relief drinking). It is therefore not surprising that alcohol dependence is associated with one or more simultaneously present co-morbidities, especially mood disorders (27.6%), anxiety disorders (23.5%), and personality disorders (39.5%). In reward-drinking, an increase in the consumption of alcohol increases the release of dopamine and endogenous opioids in the brain, creating a feeling of reward. However, excessive consumption of alcohol leads to alcohol dependence, which is characterized by impaired control over drinking, compulsive drinking, preoccupation with drinking, etc.. Development of alcohol dependence involves a series of behavioral and neurophysiological events such as increased tolerance to alcohol itself, which leads to (1) increased consumption to obtain the same pleasure; (2) a clear dissociation between \u201cliking\u201d the pleasure and \u201cwanting\u201d the substance itself leading to a pathological craving of alcohol; and (3) development of other symptoms such as stress, anxiety, depression, restlessness, fever, headaches, etc., even within 24\u201348\u2009hours of not consuming alcohol. Thus, relief-drinking involves consuming alcohol to find a relief for these symptoms, forcing the patient to relapse into alcohol consumption.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3220, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "From a systems perspective, it is hypothesized that the motivational incentive creates a salience, characterized by increased arousal and attention to the stimulus, in this case alcohol. This may be compensated for by consumption of more alcohol to achieve the same pleasure. However, in substance addiction, salience may lead to a change in the internal state of the subject to a new pathological \u201caddicted\u201d state. This pathological state is proposed to be one in which the reward system is suppressed and is hence incompetent to compensate for the salience, thus triggering pathological craving.

This may be achieved by investigating the resting-state and cue-reactive response of the brain to images of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages in patients with alcohol dependency using resting-state EEG and task-based fMRI. Previous studies have shown increased BOLD signal in response to alcohol-related cues in regions of the mesolimbic reward system such as NAcc, the ventral striatum (VS), and the amygdala (AMG). This was also accompanied by an increase in BOLD signal in other cortical regions, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), orbital frontal cortex (OFC), precuneus, insula, and parahippocampus (PHC). These findings were consistent with studies reporting abnormal resting-state brain activity in alcohol-addicted patients after a period of abstinence.

The high spatial resolution of fMRI aids in investigating activity of subcortical structures whereas the superior temporal resolution of EEG aids at looking at activity of cortical structures in different oscillatory bands. Changes in brain activity with a cue-reactivity paradigm represent the correlates of pathological craving in response to alcohol cues. Changes in spontaneous brain activity represent the same in the resting state. Thus, by combining the two we may be able to confirm the correlates of pathological craving, supporting a possible change in the state of the brain (i.e. allostasis) with high spatial and temporal resolution.

The pgACC has also been implicated to reduce aggression by exercising control over the amygdala and thus acts as a disorder-general suppression system. pgACC and OFC are also proposed to evaluate the pleasure of salient stimuli and to prioritize behaviorally relevant stimuli. The OFC itself has been shown to be involved in the assignment of reward and reward-based decision making along with the NAcc, VS, VTA, and the amygdala. Thus, the pathological increase in both BOLD signal and beta activity in pgACC may be characteristic of dysfunctional suppression of craving. This may be confirmed with the results of our previous studies, which reported a reduction in this abnormal pgACC activity following rTMS targeting the dACC, leading to suppression of craving. Additionally, hyperactivation in pgACC among heavy drinking college students may underlie greater attention and motivation for alcohol, indicating that this region can predict relapse and thus is strongly related to craving.

This study demonstrated that the reliability of the current behavioral strategy (actor) was encoded by the pgACC/vmPFC and the reliability of alternative strategies was encoded in parallel by the dorsolateral PFC. If the reliability of an alternative behavioral strategy becomes greater than that of the actor, then the actor will be rejected by ventrolateral PFC. Subsequently, the dACC will switch to the new behavioral strategy and acceptance of this new behavioral strategy as the actor is mediated by NAcc. Thus, both a medial and lateral track exist related to behavioral flexibility. The medial track consists of the vmPFC, pgACC, dACC, and VS (including NAcc). This track makes inferences about the actor that, through reinforcement learning, selects and learns the actions maximizing reward. The lateral track consists of frontopolar cortex (FPC) and middle lateral PFC (mid-LPC). This track makes inferences about alternative strategies (~2\u20133) retrieved from long-term memory. The FPC infers the absolute reliability of these alternative strategies from action outcomes while the mid-LPC detects when one of them becomes reliable enough to be the new actor. Translating this to alcohol addiction, dACC switches to an addicted state (via habenula) and NAcc confirms this state as the new reference. The pgACC confirms the addicted state as reliable, and NAcc\u2013pgACC functional connectivity maintains the addicted state.

In the cue-reactivity paradigm, we observe a disconnection between frontostriatal regions and regions of the executive control network. The pgACC/vmPFC is involved in top-down emotional regulation towards a stimulus and in this, case the pathological craving of alcohol. The decreased connectivity between the frontostriatal regions suggests impaired regulation of pathological cravings as shown in another task in patients with alcohol dependency. Furthermore, decreased resting-state functional connectivity in the executive control network has been shown as a correlate of decreased control over drinking and relapse in alcoholic patients. The consistency of these results in cue-based functional connectivity also suggests an increase in pathological craving not only in resting state but also while exposed to a stimulus. This idea is confirmed by the increase in functional connectivity between similar cortical regions in the theta frequency band. Theta has been consistently associated with substance-related disorders, especially during withdrawal and craving states, as well as in several basic motivational processes. In addition, substance abusers have been shown to exhibit bilateral hypersynchronization in the theta frequency band in the frontoposterior and frontotemporal regions compared to healthy adults. Further, theta has been associated with long-distance transmission of information, integrating it from several regions. Consistent with these results, the increased functional connectivity in the theta frequency band between regions associated with craving in the current study bolsters the hypothesis of a central craving network, where different regions encoding different aspects of alcohol addiction such as the emotional \u201cwant\u201d, \u201creward\u201d, and \u201cpleasure\u201d as well as neurobiological \u201cincentive salience\u201d are possibly maladaptively integrated into a unified percept by long-distance theta connectivity. It is important to note here that previous research shows an inverse relationship between BOLD signal activity and the lower frequencies of ongoing EEG activity.

The second is to understand the changes in activity and functional connectivity in response to alcoholic and non-alcoholic cues. The superior spatial resolution of fMRI helps us investigate deeper structures and their relevance to pathological craving in alcohol dependence on exposure to alcohol-related cues. Conversely, the superior temporal resolution of EEG helps us to understand the changes in different frequency bands. The combination of these two techniques in the same patients gives us a more comprehensive view of pathological craving and the functional networks that may encode it.

According to previous literature, alcohol addiction is a learned response wherein the hedonic weight to stimuli is decreased on excessive consumption of the substance by associating it with a paradoxical reward. This results in a shift in the normal, healthy self-referential state to an addicted state characterized by an incentive salience, which behaviorally manifests as a pathological craving for the substance. This craving is strongly associated with an emotional component and thus results in relapse of excessive alcohol consumption following even a short period of abstinence. In the current study, we propose that these different aspects of substance-related craving are encoded by a central craving network characterized by changes in activity and functional connectivity of the NAcc, VS, amygdala, PHC, PCC, dACC, pgACC, and OFC. The associative learning of the paradoxical reward may be mediated by the regions of the limbic and medial temporal lobes; the shift in self-referential state may be encoded by the PCC; the incentive salience may be encoded by limbic regions and dACC; the emotional component may be encoded by the limbic regions along with the pgACC and OFC.

Then the lagged phase coherence at 10\u2009Hz indicates coherent oscillations with a 25 ms delay, while at 20\u2009Hz the delay is 12.5 ms, etc. The threshold of significance for a given lagged phase coherence value according to asymptotic results can be found as described by Pascual-Marqui (2007), where the definition of lagged phase coherence can be found as well. As such, this measure of dependence can be applied to any number of brain areas jointly, i.e., distributed cortical networks, whose activity can be estimated with sLORETA. Measures of linear dependence (coherence) between the multivariate time series are defined. The measures are non-negative, and take the value zero only when there is independence and are defined in the frequency domain: delta (2\u20133.5\u2009Hz), theta (4\u20137.5\u2009Hz), alpha1 (8\u201310\u2009Hz), alpha2 (10\u201312\u2009Hz), beta1 (13\u201318\u2009Hz), beta2 (18.5\u201321\u2009Hz), beta3 (21.5\u201330\u2009Hz) and gamma (30.5\u201344\u2009Hz). Based on this principle, lagged linear connectivity was calculated. Time-series of current density were extracted for different regions of interests using sLORETA. Power in all 6,239 voxels was normalized to a power of 1 and log transformed at each time point. Region of interest values thus reflect the log-transformed fraction of total power across all voxels, separately for specific frequencies. Regions of interest selected were based on the activity findings of both EEG and fMRI - left and right orbitofrontal cortex, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, the left and right inferior frontal gyrus, the left and right insula, the left parahippocampus.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 43286, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Statistical analyses", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 43307, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The methodology used is a non-parametric permutation test.

Due to the non-parametric nature of this method, its validity does not rely on any assumption of Gaussianity. The significance threshold for all tests was based on a permutation test with 5000 permutations. Comparisons were made between the healthy controls versus patients with an alcohol addiction.
