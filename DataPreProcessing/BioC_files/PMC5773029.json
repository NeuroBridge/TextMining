In this exploratory group, the goal of the intervention is to increase the inhibiting influence of the rIFG to the VS and the participants are instructed to downregulate the depicted process. However, a negative correlation between VS and rIFG could arise from the desired state, but also from an inverse behavior of the system with increased VS and diminished frontal activity. To enforce the top-down inhibitory state of the system we included the additional constraints in the connectivity feedback that the VS should be downregulated and the rIFG should be upregulated and switch negative feedback values to positive if these constraints are not met.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17016, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Task design", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17028, "infons": {"file": "12888_2018_1604_Fig3_HTML.jpg", "id": "Fig3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Experimental design.

Since we focus on ventral striatal activation to alcohol cues and its prefrontal control, it could be expected that particularly those patients will profit from the intervention that show substantial ventral striatal cue reactivity to alcohol cues prior to the intervention as it has been shown for other treatments before. However, it has been shown that AUD is often associated with a shift of cue reactivity from ventral to dorsal striatum. For those patients, showing a more habit like addiction behavior, instead of the ventral striatum, the dorsal striatum might be an interesting target for NFB interventions in AUD. Nevertheless, there is no doubt, that prefrontal control regions play a central role in craving and relapse. Therefore, it could be speculated that patients receiving a PFC upregulation feedback might benefit from the NF treatment even if they do not show strong ventral but increased dorsal striatal activation to alcohol related cues.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24016, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An innovative condition in the present study is the connectivity feedback condition.

Kirsch et al. showed that successful VS downregulation was accompanied by the application of specific cognitive strategies, which might have let to the concurrent increase of prefrontal activation, although this activation was not fed back to the participants.

Other possibilities would be to use a control group without feedback, a group that just views feedback signal of other participants without instructions, or a yoke-control group that is told to regulate the process but receives feedback from another person. For task comparability we decided against the first two options, and for ethical reasons a yoke-control group in which participants would receive fake instructions is questionable.

First, the study is only single-blind. The staff members must prepare the individual feedback set up (definition of ROI, definition of direction) and are therefore not blinded. In future studies, a double-blind protocol could be implemented by separating staff that prepares the individual NF setup and staff that instructs the participants. However, we think it is worth to test the general applicability of rtfMRI NF to AUD patients before setting up such an extensive study protocol. Second, the study was retrospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00010253; WHO Universal Trial Number (UTN): U1111\u20131181-4218).

However, the registration complies with the goals of the study described in the grant proposal and the study protocol will not be altered during the study. Finally, we have not defined stopping criteria, because we do not expect side effects besides those that can be expected from fMRI scanning, which is a safe and well-established technique.
