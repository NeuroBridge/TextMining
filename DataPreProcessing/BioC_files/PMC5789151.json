White matter connectivity in schizophrenia has been predominantly investigated using diffusion weighted imaging, with reductions in fractional anisotropy throughout the brain often interpreted as an indicator of abnormal myelination. However, diffusion weighted imaging lacks specificity and as such a number of microstructural factors besides myelin may be contributing to these results. We utilised multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) in medicated patients with chronic schizophrenia, stratified by treatment response status, and healthy controls, in order to assess myelin water fraction (MWF) in these groups. In addition, we assessed cognitive control using the Stroop task to investigate how response inhibition relates to myelination in patients and controls. Both treatment resistant (n\u202f=\u202f22) and treatment responsive (n\u202f=\u202f21) patients showed reduced MWF compared to healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f24) in bilateral fronto-occipital fasciculi, particularly evident in the vicinity of the striatum und extending to the cerebellum, with no difference between patient groups. Patients showed greater reaction time interference on the Stroop task compared to healthy controls, with no difference between patient groups. Stroop interference was significantly negatively correlated with MWF in the corpus callosum across groups, and MWF differences in this region mediated the behavioural group effects on the Stroop task. These findings support the suitability of mcDESPOT as a myelin-specific measure of abnormal connectivity in schizophrenia, and suggest that treatment resistant schizophrenia is not characterised by more severe abnormalities in myelination or cognitive control compared to treatment responsive schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2017, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Highlights", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2028, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Treatment resistant and responsive schizophrenia patients show reduced myelin water fraction compared to healthy controls", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2150, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Myelin water fraction in the corpus callosum is related to performance on a cognitive control task", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2249, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Myelin water fraction in the corpus callosum mediates differences in a cognitive control task between patients and controls", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2373, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2386, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Schizophrenia, a debilitating psychotic disorder, has been widely described in terms of a dysconnection syndrome. Symptoms of psychosis, including delusions and hallucinations, are in part suggested to emerge as a result of inadequate integration of neural processes in the brain. Both functional and structural connectivity dysfunctions have been observed in schizophrenia and it is by now widely established that white matter abnormalities are pervasive in the disorder.

However, symptomatic non-response to treatment remains an area of unmet clinical need, with around 30% of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia showing inadequate response despite optimal treatment. It is likely that this form of \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d schizophrenia (TRS) differs in terms of its underlying neurobiology from treatment responsive schizophrenia. As a result, antipsychotic medication acting on the dopamine system may not be targeting the underlying cause of psychosis in TRS patients. It has been suggested that TRS is characterised by more severe or distinct patterns of structural dysconnectivity compared to treatment responsive schizophrenia, resulting in more severe cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms.

The most commonly reported measure is fractional anisotropy (FA), which indexes the degree of directionality of diffusing water molecules. Changes in FA are attributed to changes in the microstructure of white matter tracts; however, these could in effect be indicators of numerous underlying features such as myelination, axon diameter, fibre density, axon number, or axonal membrane integrity. Multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) is a recently developed imaging technique which allows for the derivation of a whole-brain myelin water fraction (MWF) map with rapid acquisition times. As a metric for the fraction of water trapped between the myelin sheaths around the neuronal axons, MWF has been shown to correlate strongly with histological measures of myelin content, and to provide higher specificity to myelin content as compared with diffusion measures. Here we report the first study utilising mcDESPOT in a sample of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, stratified by treatment response status, and a healthy control sample. In order to assess the relationship between myelination, treatment response, and cognitive function, we included a basic measure of executive control, the Stroop task.

Pairwise comparisons of mean MWF in the corpus callosum between HC and the two patient subgroups did not survive Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons; hence NTR and TRS patients were pooled into a single schizophrenia (SZ) group for the mediation analysis. We tested whether corpus callosum MWF mediated group differences in the Stroop effect following the Baron and Kenny approach (; Fig. 4). Regressing the Stroop effect on group (HC vs. SZ) showed a significant effect of group (beta\u202f=\u202f93.08, sd\u202f=\u202f28.93, p\u202f=\u202f0.002).

An analysis of the indirect effect (defined as the product between the effect of group on MWF and the effect of MWF on RT Stroop, controlling for group) was performed with non-parametric bootstrapping of the sampling distribution using 5000 bootstrap samples.

Reductions in the patient groups were bilateral but with larger clusters observed within the left cerebral hemisphere. Mean MWF in the significant areas were below the expected range for white matter, thus suggesting that the reductions included both white and grey matter voxels. Histograms of MWF restricted to the white matter tracts allowed us to more closely compare the distribution of values specifically in the white matter between the three groups, confirming that patients' histograms were shifted towards lower MWF values, with a greater variance compared to healthy controls. MWF did not, however, distinguish between the two patient subgroups, consisting of treatment resistant (TRS) and treatment responsive (NTR) schizophrenia patients.

The proliferation of diffusion weighted imaging reports in recent years has shed enormous light on disturbances of white matter in psychosis and schizophrenia on a whole-brain basis, yet a remaining disadvantage of the technique is the large number of microstructural factors which could contribute to the signal. Multicomponent relaxation imaging allows for a more myelin-specific quantification of the dysfunction in vivo. The mcDESPOT protocol is such a technique which has recently been validated pre-clinically, and to our knowledge this is the first report to use this technique in chronic patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, with an additional stratification by treatment response status. The mechanisms underlying resistance to antipsychotic medication are as yet not well understood, but the lack of response despite adequate dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in TRS suggests that striatal hyperdopaminergia may not be the principal aetiology of psychotic symptoms in this patient subgroup. One study investigating white matter microstructure found reduced fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in the corpus callosum in chronic treatment resistant patients as compared to healthy controls; however this study did not include a remitted patient group and as such the specificity of the finding to TRS is unclear. On a functional connectivity level, a recent report by suggested that divergent pathophysiologies of striatal resting-state connectivity are present in treatment resistant and treatment responsive schizophrenia. In addition, Sarpal and colleagues demonstrated that functional striatal resting-state connectivity may be predictive of treatment response in first-episode psychosis patients. Our data suggest that these findings of functional connectivity differences are not mirrored by myelin water fraction differences. In this chronic patient sample, the effects of illness chronicity and exposure to medication can by definition not be entirely disentangled from the effects of interest and therefore remain as potential confounds. However, the absence of group difference on these variables as well as the lack of association with myelin water fraction suggest that it is unlikely that these effects are masking true differences in myelination between treatment resistant and responsive patients.

The presence of cognitive control deficits, accompanied by abnormal activation of networks underlying cognitive control, has been widely established in schizophrenia and the extent of the dysfunction has been linked to symptom severity. An exacerbated inability to exert cognitive control may thus result in the persistence of symptoms even if a subcortical dopamine dysfunction is normalised. Cognitive control further relies on intact connectivity of the underlying neural network; hence we aimed to assess how both cognitive and structural mechanisms relate to treatment response. We did not observe differences in reaction time interference on the Stroop task between the two patient groups. Thus on a behavioural level, treatment resistance does not seem to be associated with exacerbated cognitive control deficits at the chronic stage of the illness. However, callosal myelin reductions in schizophrenia patients partially mediated performance differences compared to healthy individuals.
