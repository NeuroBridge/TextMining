Even though considerable efforts have been made over the past decades, quantitative alterations between patients and healthy subjects have not yet provided a diagnostic measure with sufficient high sensitivity and specificity. One of the most important reasons is the lack of consistent findings, which is in part due to single-mode study, which only detects single dimensional information by each modality, and thus misses the most crucial differences between groups. Here, we hypothesize that multimodal integration of functional MRI (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) might yield more power for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. A novel multivariate data fusion method for combining these modalities is introduced without reducing the dimension or using the priors from 161 schizophrenia patients and 168 matched healthy controls. The multi-index feature for each ROI is constructed and summarized with Wilk's lambda by performing multivariate analysis of variance to calculate the significant difference between different groups. Our results show that, among these modalities, fMRI has the most significant featureby calculating the Jaccard similarity coefficient (0.7416) and Kappa index (0.4833). Furthermore, fusion of these modalities provides the most plentiful information and the highest predictive accuracy of 86.52%.

Considerable efforts have been made over the last decades to identify biological markers for clinical diagnosis and prediction of disease progression. Plenty of studies have described significant differences in schizophrenia (SZ) patients compared to healthy controls (HC)across different imaging modalities. Each modality records specific facets of structure or function MRI and provides biomarkers that may either be specific or common to other modalities. Typically, these modalities are analyzed separately based on their own models and thus the biomarkers are obtained from each single modality separately. For example, functional MRI (fMRI) measures the hemodynamic response related to neural activity in the brain dynamically, from which disease biomarkers related to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and parietal cortex are generally reported. Structure MRI (sMRI) provides information about the tissue type of the brain (grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM)), from which biomarkers related to frontal and temporal cortex, and hippocampus are often pointed out. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) captures diffusion of water molecules to reflect the directional microstructure within WM and complements the missing orientation information in structural images. By using DTI and related analysis, abnormalities related to superior and prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia patients are frequently studied. Despite the imaging studies have identified quantitative alterations in schizophrenia, these findings have not yet provided a diagnostic measure with sufficient high sensitivity and specificity. Even though part of the actualities is the heterogeneousness of these psychiatric disorders, the lack of consistent findings due to the specificity of individual model also limits the sensitivity and specificity.

Comparison between function and structure provides more informative insights into both altered brain patterns and connectivity, and might be useful for diagnosis of schizophrenia when having both. For example, one would detect a change in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation maps that are associated with a change in the brain structure.

While this is a powerful technique, a common limitation is that the potentially unrealistic assumptions which are fundamentally of a different nature than the known modality would be imposed upon the constrained data. Another data fusion approach is to first process each image type and extract features from different modalities. These features are then examined for relationships among the data types at the group level (i.e., variations among individuals or between patients and controls). Such approaches include those based upon singular value decomposition (SVD) and partial least squares (PLS) as well as joint independent component analysis(jICA), multimodal canonical correlation analysis (mCCA), linked ICA and other adaptive approaches such as parallel ICA. These approaches take advantage of the \u2018cross\u2019-information among data types when performing multimodal fusion and provides a natural link among different data types.

Specifically, the whole brain single-modal or multi-modal features are applied to the raw input matrix. Statistically significant features (p-value of two-sample t-test being smaller than a threshold) are selected. Different kernel types (linear, t = 0; polynomial, t = 1; radial basis function, t = 2) and different trade-off parameter C (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000) is tried to obtain the highest accuracy rate. To measure the test performance and to validate the classifier, we implement 10-fold cross-validation with three levels of nesting for tuning and validating our model. That is, for each iteration, eight folds of the subjects are used for training, one fold is used to optimize the parameters and another fold for testing. The procedure is iterated for 100 times, and the meandiscrimination accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are reported with the best parameter setting. The features are selected in each cross-validation run and the features with high weights during the 100 iterations are the optimized features for each classifier. Choosing the generalization rate as the statistic, permutation tests are employed to estimate the statistical significance of the observed classification accuracy. In permutation testing, the class labels of the training data are randomly permuted prior to training. Cross-validation is then performed on the permuted training set, and the permutation is repeated 100 times. The p-value represents the probability of observing a classification prediction rate in a permutation testing no less than the discrimination accuracy. If the p-value is smaller than the significant level, we reject the null hypothesis that the classifier could not learn the relationship between the data and the labels reliably and declare that the classifier learns the relationship with a probability of being wrong of at most p.The flowchart of the pattern recognition is shown in S1 Fig.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22015, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Diversity of individual modalities in classification", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22068, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As mentioned earlier, a lot of studies have indicated that different modalities contain complementary information for discrimination.

By constructing the multi-index feature for each ROI, we calculated the p value of significant difference between groups for four different models (fMRI, sMRI, DTI, fusion). Our results showed that the three-way fusion feature has the smallest p value in most of the brain ROIs which indicates that we can increase the difference between the groups by integrating additional information. The results of discriminant analysis confirmed this conclusion which shows that each modality (fMRI, sMRI, and DTI) is indispensable for achieving good combination and classification. The fusion feature has the highest predictive accuracy of 86.12% while the best accuracy on measure of individual modality is only 84.47% when using fMRI. Our second job is to compare the similarity and diversity of individual modalities in classification. The fMRI and sMRI are very much similar both with Jaccard similarity coefficient (J = 0.9422) and with Kappa index (K = 0.8844). The fMRI has the highest information for fusion feature (J = 0.7416, K = 0.4833) among three individual modalities. At last, we find that fMRI feature has the greatest contribution of 90% to the fusion feature from the perspective of the goodness of fit.

Several works have reported their works on combining different modalities of biomarkers. However, there have been only a few reports combining three or more types of brain imaging data to investigate brain disorders. For example, Correa examined changes that are related across fMRI, sMRI, and EEG data for SZ. Groves compared Alzheimer\u2019s patients and age-matched controls by combining gray matter (GM) density and three diffusion data measures (fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and tensor mode). Other advances in multi-way data fusion include integrating multiple (task) fMRI data sets from the same participant to specify common versus specific sources of activity to a greater degree than traditional general linear model-based approaches.

For example, there have been some attempts to utilize structural and functional information jointly (e.g., correlation of structural volumes with functional activation in certain regions). Voxelbased morphometric methods also provide a way to directly compare changes in relative gray matter amounts to changes in fMRI regions by overlapping the statistical maps created from each approach. Other existing approaches for data combination include constraining one modality with another, as EEG or DTI being constrained by fMRI or sMRI data, or vice versa.

Our another promising result is that the fMRI data is the most informative (90% contribution to the fusion feature) while DTI is the least informative (9.8% contribution to the fusion feature) among these three modalities. Actually, it is easy to understand. fMRI measures the hemodynamic response related to neural activity in the brain dynamically which has better spatial resolution. It often scans for several minutes and contains more information compared with sMRI. As for DTI, we just integrate three feathers FA, RD, MD to the fusion features, it is certainly less informative than fMRI feature. Of course, we can fully integrate the DTI data into our approach, as we do for fMRI.
