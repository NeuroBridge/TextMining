Neuroimaging has helped to demarcate the dynamics of two distinct functional connectivity circuits underlying the social-affective processes related to mentalization (known as Theory of Mind, ToM) and somatic-affiliation (known as Embodied Simulation, ES). While evidence points to abnormal activation patterns within these networks among those suffering from schizophrenia, it is yet unclear however, if these patients exhibit this abnormal functional connectivity in the context of social-affective experiences. The current fMRI study, investigated functional connectivity dynamics within ToM and ES networks as subjects experienced evolving cinematic portrayals of fear. During scanning, schizophrenia patients and healthy controls passively watched a cinematic scene in which a mother and her son face various threatening events. Participants then provided a continuous and retrospective report of their fear intensity during a second viewing outside the scanner. Using network cohesion index (NCI) analysis, we examined modulations of ES-related and ToM-related functional connectivity dynamics and their relation to symptom severity and the continuous emotional ratings of the induced cinematic fear. Compared to patients, healthy controls showed higher ES-NCI and marginally lower ToM-NCI during emotional peaks. Cross-correlation analysis revealed an intriguing dynamic between NCI and the inter-group difference of reported fear. Schizophrenia patients rated their fear as lower relative to healthy controls, shortly after exhibiting lower ES connectivity. This increased difference in rating was also followed by higher ToM connectivity among schizophrenia patients. The clinical relevance of these findings is further highlighted by the following two results: (a) ToM-NCI was found to have a strong correlation with the severity of general symptoms during one of the two main emotional peaks (Spearman R\u2009=\u20090.77); and (b) k-mean clustering demonstrated that the networks\u2019 NCI dynamic during the social-affective context reliably differentiated between patients and controls. Together, these findings point to a possible neural marker for abnormal social-affective processing in schizophrenia, manifested as the disturbed balance between two functional networks involved in social-affective affiliation. This in turn suggests that exaggerated mentalization over somatic-affiliative processing, in response to another\u2019s\u2019 distress may underlie social-affective deficits in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2773, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2786, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Impairments in social cognition and interactions are core psychopathologies in schizophrenia and highly relevant to the patients\u2019 functional outcome. More specifically, schizophrenia patients show deficits in understanding the intentions of others and establishing trusting, intimate relationships\u2014crucial components for leading a viable and fulfilling social life. Moreover, such social-cognitive deficits often invoke an affective state of fear or aversion of others (i.e. paranoia or avoidance of social interactions), leading to the exacerbation of the patient\u2019s emotional well-being. Such deficits manifest in various cognitive-affective domains, including attention allocation, recognition and interpretation of affective social contents, and social motivation. Indeed, sibling studies point to a hereditary basis for impairments in social cognition and interaction among those suffering from schizophrenia. Thus, identifying the neural underpinnings of such social-affective deficits in schizophrenia could provide markers for vulnerability and/or clinical status, as well as targets for early interventions or preventive treatments for siblings.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3940, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Two main processes have been suggested to underlie social cognition in humans; the process of mentalization, also known as Theory of mind (ToM), refers to the ability to attribute various mental states to our own, as well as to others\u2019, beliefs, intentions, goals and behavior; somatic-affiliation, also known as embodied simulation(ES) or affective resonance, denotes the internalization of another\u2019s visceral and affective state by vicariously creating mental simulations of such states (for a review see ref. ). Neuroimaging and lesion studies have both indicated that these two modes of social affective processes indeed rely on different neural circuits, with ToM implicating a medial prefrontal\u2014temporo-parietal network, and ES associated with a neural circuit that includes the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4782, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Importantly, behavioral and neuroimaging studies on schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia demonstrate impairments in these processes.

The neural dynamics of these processes were rendered using a naturalistic emotional cinematic experience that depicted a threatening scene in which two characters (a mother and son) face the development of a dreadful situation. The approach for portraying the functional dynamics of the networks chosen a priori was based on our previous work showing a continuous measurement of within-network and between-network cohesion (termed network cohesion index, NCI). Using this approach in a previous study we successfully delineated the dynamics between ES and ToM networks, among a group of healthy participants, while they passively watched cinematic scenes that induced feelings of sadness. Specifically, we found that the NCI of these networks was related to an individual\u2019s personal tendency to experience distress during the emotional peaks of the cinematic experience, as illustrated by an empathy trait questionnaire. Especially intriguing was the observed dissociation between the NCI patterns of these two networks during peaks of sadness throughout the threatening scene; while the ToM network showed reduced NCI, the ES network exhibited increased NCI. Based on these studies, and taking into accounting the known difficulties in social cognition and interactions, we anticipate that the schizophrenia patients will provide a blunted continues report of their emotional experience during peak moments of threat in the film clip relative to healthy controls. In addition, in line with the previously described abnormalities found among schizophrenia patients in the major nodes of ToM and ES networks, we also expect to find abnormal NCI dynamics between the ES and ToM networks relative to healthy controls.

Thus, the deficiency in ES network connectivity among schizophrenia patients may be context-dependent as opposed to a constant tonic feature.

The decreased ES cohesion among schizophrenia patients, prior to peak differences in emotional experiences, indicates a neural source for false attribution to externally driven socially salient cues. Although speculative, the finding of the abnormal balance between ES and ToM networks when facing the distress of others might underlie the tendency of schizophrenia patients to detach from social salient cues while engaging in internally-generated active mentalization. The significant classification based on ES and ToM NCIs, as well as the correlation between enhanced ToM-NCI and symptom severity further support such a proposition.
