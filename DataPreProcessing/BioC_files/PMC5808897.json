At follow-up, it was hypothesized that youth with AUD risk factors (i.e., FHP, male, and history of early dating) would show deviations in their BOLD activation to alcohol picture cues as compared to their low-risk peers (i.e., FHN, female, and non-early daters). If substantiated, this would suggest that the experience of alcohol consumption changes how adolescents process alcohol-related cues. As expected, we found no main effect of group for family history, sex, and early-dating history, but a significant main effect of time and risk factor by time interactions. These results suggest that the influence of each risk factor on neural processing of appetitive alcohol cues is highly dependent on personal experience with alcohol.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25705, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Regions implicated in the current study (i.e., occipital, frontal, and limbic areas) are consistent with prior studies that examined differential alcohol cue-reactivity in adolescent drinkers and in other addictive behaviors. Unexpectedly, visual inspection of interaction effects suggested that at baseline, youth with and without risk factors showed pre-existing differences in activation to alcohol cues based on their family history, early-dating history, and sex even prior to any alcohol use. FHP youth showed greater activation at baseline, but lower activation at follow-up in the right cingulate and middle occipital gyri. This suggests that, in response to alcohol-related cues, FHP youth may allocate attention and experience craving responses differently than FHN youth even in the absence of differences in drinking behavior. Mechanistically, this deviation in the emotional and visual processing of alcohol picture cues has been proposed to originate in the anterior cingulate of the mesocorticolimbic system, innervating the visual cortex and resulting in differences in the individual saliency of alcohol-related cues. Similarly, at baseline, youth with an early-dating history showed greater activation to alcohol picture cues compared to their counterparts, but exhibited an overall decrease in activation at follow-up, in the left anterior cingulate/white matter region. Interestingly, girls showed greater activation to alcohol than boys at baseline but lower activation at follow-up in the left middle frontal gyrus.

Importantly, family history and sex are commonly conceptualized as proxies for genetic vulnerabilities, implying temporal precedence, such that differences serve as risk factors for, or leads to, maladaptive alcohol use patterns. In the current study, we found that individuals with a positive family history of AUD and those who have engaged in early dating showed greater activation at baseline but lower activation at follow-up, compared to their counterparts (i.e., FHN and no early-dating history). The opposite pattern was found for males vs. females (i.e., boys showed lower activation at baseline but greater activation at follow-up compared to girls). These results have two important implications. First, they suggest that youth with these risk factors indeed show differences in alcohol-cue reactivity even before engaging in any personal experience with the substance. Further, at-risk youth continue to show differences in alcohol-cue reactivity even after transition. Additionally, the use of a single statistical model allowed for comparison of Z-scores to better understand effect strength. Results suggest that early dating appears to exhibit similar magnitudes of effect on alcohol cue-reactivity as family history and sex.

While research has highlighted the importance of violent romantic relationships in the escalation of substance use, little is known about how involvement in non-violent romantic relationships affects the development and trajectory of alcohol use, especially among adolescents. In line with previous research suggesting that early dating may be an important risk factor for later alcohol use, we found that youth with a history of early-dating showed differential activation at baseline and follow-up in the left anterior cingulate/white matter region, an area implicated in addictions. Alcohol consumption and dating in adolescents are intricately related. Having more romantic dating experiences is correlated with having an increased social network (i.e., friendships and romantic relationships) and greater social acceptance among peers. Further, adolescent alcohol and other substance use behaviors is positively correlated with peer attitudes and use patterns. In particular, youth are more likely to acquire romantic partners with similar drinking habits; further, the frequency of alcohol use among adolescents and their romantic partners are positively correlated. The effects of early dating on adolescent drinking may operate in both direct (e.g., disinhibited behaviors during alcohol use may lead to greater risky sexual behaviors) and indirect ways (e.g., early dating as an indicator of greater sociability and increased likelihood of exposure to peer alcohol use behaviors). Neurologically, it is possible that the effects of early-dating history on alcohol-cue reactivity operates through a third covariate, mediator, or moderator factor. For example, youth who engage in early-dating may also exhibit increased impulsivity and/or reward sensitivity, which leads to or is associated with, differential alcohol-cue reactivity. Considering the dearth of studies on adolescent early-dating history and fMRI response, this may be an important area of exploration in future studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31139, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In two of the three predictors examined, youth with an AUD risk factor (i.e., FHP and early dating) consistently showed greater activation to alcohol cues than neutral trials at baseline. On the other hand, boys, who are at greater risk for AUD development, tended to show less activation to alcohol cues compared to girls at baseline but increased activation at follow-up. Although the reasons and mechanisms remain unclear, one may postulate that social influences play a role in the latter finding. Themes of masculinity are often depicted in alcohol television ads. Further, adolescent boys, compared to their female counterparts, receive greater exposure to such depictions through sports watching. It is possible that boys exhibited a lower BOLD response to alcohol cues at baseline in part due to desensitization to alcohol picture cues after repeated exposure. These findings controlled for the effects of age, despite a small range at baseline and follow-up, and past-year alcohol consumption at follow-up. Thus, the results reported here are less likely attributable to differences in brain maturation. Further, while most previous reports of alcohol cue reactivity have examined drinker group differences (e.g., drinkers vs. controls), all participants in the current study were moderate to heavy drinkers at follow-up and analyses controlled for past year drinking quantity. Therefore, differences in BOLD activation observed in this study are interpreted as due to the influence of AUD risk factors, above and beyond drinking status. Overall, results suggest that youth at risk for heavier drinking show deviations in brain activation patterns to alcohol picture cues even when their drinking level is no different from youth without these risk factors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32906, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, although alcohol use quantity was statistically controlled for, information about other aspects of alcohol consumption were not assessed and therefore cannot be modeled. For example, while participants reported no substance use at baseline, detailed assessments of exposure to alcohol-related events and stimuli, such as television commercials and exposure to peer alcohol use on social media were not obtained. Likewise, all participants were moderate to heavy drinkers at follow-up, but each individual\u2019s rearing and social environment is different, and thus, may differentially affect each participant\u2019s perception of alcohol in diverse ways. Second, the sample of adolescents in this study is comprised of healthy, highly functional individuals primarily from middle-class families. No participant met diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder, thus, it is unclear if and how the results of the current study may be applied to individuals with more severe alcohol use patterns and/or substance use disorders. Results of this study suggest that history of dating prior to age 14 may play an important role in differential cue-reactivity to alcohol pictures. However, few studies have examined this index as a risk factor or as a possible influence of drinking behavior. Nevertheless, an important limitation of the current study was the relatively simplistic definition of this index, such that a history of early dating included youth who endorsed any involvement in dating activity, even if rarely. It is unclear whether there may differences in cue-reactivity among youth who are engaged in different levels of early dating, a question that was not examined in the current study due to inadequate power.
