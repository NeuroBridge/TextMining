Graph theoretic and network\u2010based statistical analysis of resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data revealed that alcohol\u2010dependent subjects had reduced functional connectivity of a dispersed network compared with both poly\u2010drug\u2010dependent and healthy subjects.

Naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist targeting particularly the mu\u2010opioid receptor (MOR) subtype (Verebey & Mule 1975; Schmidt et al. 1985), has been shown in randomized controlled trials to be effective in alcohol dependence (AD) but may be more effective in some individuals or subgroups and not others (Streeton & Whelan 2001) (Anton 2008; Sturgess et al. 2011).

Activation and inhibition of the MOR in the ventral tegmental area regulates basal dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) (Spanagel, Herz, & Shippenberg 1992). MOR blockade in the ventral tegmental area inhibits dopamine release following alcohol intake and opioid antagonists reduce alcohol intake in rodents (Mitchell et al. 2009). Consistent with this preclinical literature, naltrexone has been shown to have a small\u2010to\u2010moderate effect size in reducing alcohol use in some (Garbutt et al. 1999; Bouza et al. 2004) but not all studies (Krystal et al. 2001). In heroin dependence, naltrexone blocks the physiological and psychological effects of heroin (Navaratnam et al. 1994; Brewer 2002; Brewer & Streel 2010), preventing relapse, particularly in the early detoxification phase (Foster, Brewer, & Steele 2003).

Neural network organization can be examined based on synchronization of intrinsic fluctuations in neural activity during rest, referred to as functional connectivity. Indeed, aberrant resting\u2010state functional connectivity across the brain has been demonstrated in heroin (Liu et al. 2010; Yuan et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2013b), cocaine (Gu et al. 2010; Kelly et al. 2011; Konova et al. 2013) and alcohol (Weiland et al. 2014) use disorders.

This analysis method identifies and characterizes the topological organization of brain networks as a whole (Bullmore & Sporns 2009; He & Evans 2010), rather than based on a regional approach. Mathematical characteristics of the entire network can be obtained, which moves away from examining specific regions and considers the brain a single functioning network. In this paper, we focus on network efficiency, which is indicated by the two basic network properties, clustering coefficient and path length (Watts & Strogatz 1998; He & Evans 2010). A clustering coefficient describes the number of all neighbouring connections for each region in a network (node) as a function of the total possible number of connections. Thus, it represents a measure of the local efficiency of a network. Path length describes the average number of connections needed for any two nodes to link, so inversely indicating global efficiency.

A small sample of cocaine\u2010dependent individuals show reduced local efficiency (Wang et al. 2015).

Interpretation of these findings is limited by the comorbidity within this group, and we caution that further investigation of local efficiency in poly\u2010drug SD is necessary. For example, heroin\u2010dependent individuals show a shift to a more random network (Jiang et al. 2013b), but cocaine\u2010dependent individuals show reduced local efficiency (Wang et al. 2015). However, the current study does clarify the effect of naltrexone on local efficiency in AD subjects.

This means that information processing within certain neural networks is stronger, with less cross\u2010talk between distinct functional processes. This clustering of connections suggests hyperactive intermediate signalling (rather than long\u2010range signalling) in the network, perturbing the capacity for more global neural cooperation or wider cortical interactions (Sporns et al. 2004). Higher local efficiency may also suggest higher likelihood of closed feedback loops and enhanced reciprocity of connections, meaning that information is not dispersed and processed across networks but remains closed off in a specific network model (Sporns et al. 2004). Thus, information process is more segregated and clustered. Higher segregation of network communication may relate to less flexible information processing, a functional segregation and behavioural rigidity that is observed in addiction. The medial orbitofrontal cortex and supplementary motor area were particularly implicated as being more segregated. Indeed, AD individuals have reduced volume and cortical thickness of the orbitofrontal cortex (Durazzo et al. 2011) that predicts future relapse (Beck et al. 2012) and simultaneously show heightened drug cue reactivity in this region (Chase et al. 2011; Kuhn & Gallinat 2011; Engelmann et al. 2012), which is modulated by gene type during naltrexone (OPRM1 gene G allele carriers) (Kareken et al. 2010). Similarly, supplementary motor area volume is reduced in binge drinkers (Kvamme et al. 2016), and AD subjects show increased SMA activity related to impulsivity (Claus, Kiehl, & Hutchison 2011).

In the current paper, NBS were used to examine which nodes of the network might be driving the finding of heightened local efficiency in the AD group. AD demonstrated a significant reduction in connectivity in a network involving frontal and temporal and supplementary motor regions, compared with HV. This might suggest that frontal and temporal regions show enhanced clustering and segregation of information processing that would simultaneously contribute to reduced functional connectivity and higher global local efficiency. Furthermore, the decreased functional connectivity in AD revealed by NBS may be long\u2010range, cross\u2010module connections. A reduction in long\u2010range connections is associated with more isolated local circuits, making circuit modules highly clustered, thereby increasing local efficiency. Reduced neural functional connectivity has been previously demonstrated in this group, particularly of the left executive control network (including parietal, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex), i.e. associated with impaired behavioural control and alcohol use severity (Weiland et al. 2014). Furthermore, in young adults at high risk for AD, enhanced task\u2010related functional connectivity among nucleus accumbens, sensorimotor cortex and precuneus has been associated with alcohol use severity (Weiland et al. 2014).

However, few studies have focused on poly\u2010drug SD, and as mentioned, comorbidity might be an issue because of distinct effects of each substance of abuse on topological or functional network properties.
