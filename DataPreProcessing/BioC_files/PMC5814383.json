The first reported cases of autism were initially thought to be a form of infantile SZ. In fact, the name Autism, which comes from the Greek word \u201cauto\u201d meaning \u201cself\u201d, was originally used to describe a lack of interest in social interaction in individuals with schizophrenia. Later the term became associated with children who exhibited a similar lack of interest in social interaction and the spectrum of disorders we now call ASD. The young age of onset of clinical symptoms and lack of psychosis in ASD were later recognized as the main features that separated SZ from ASD. While they are now recognized as distinct disorders, their shared cognitive symptoms include impairments in social interaction and communication, deficits in processing emotion, theory of mind abilities, language skills and learning, and the inability to suppress irrelevant information. There are currently no medical tests available for either disorder. According to the diagnostic guidelines contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), many patients may qualify as having either condition.

Comparative studies aimed at understanding the genetic etiological relationship between the two disorders have identified some evidence for overlapping etiology and some evidence for diametric etiology (resulting from reciprocal alterations to common risk factors). While there is strong evidence for genetic risk factors and heritability, overlapping epigenetic mechanisms are now recognized as potentially playing a vital role in pathogenesis (; see for reviews in ASD and schizophrenia respectively). The resulting cognitive deficits observed in both disorders are believed to be caused by altered communication between brain areas. However, studies aimed at identifying the regions of altered connectivity have yielded many conflicting results and failed replications. The large majority of such studies have made use of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) because of its ease of collection and the ability to make measurements of large-scale functional connectivity across the brain. Functional connectivity refers to the temporal correlation between activity in different brain regions often interpreted as an indication of interaction between them. Both disorders are associated with decreases in interhemispheric connectivity (SZ:; ASD:), particularly in sensory regions and alterations in connectivity between frontal and posterior regions in the parietal lobe and occipital cortex (SZ:; ASD:). Both have been associated with changes in connectivity within the default mode network (DMN). However, in some studies, increases rather than decreases in inter-regional functional connectivity are reported and others fail to find significant regional differences (see for review in ASD and for SZ). Inconsistencies in study outcomes may reflect methodological differences, and/or differences in patient sub-populations (age, sex, IQ, medication, and/or disease severity and duration), but also highlight the variability in these patient populations and the difficulty of characterizing either disorder by changes in connectivity between any one or two regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5248, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Where studies of regional changes in connectivity have yielded inconsistent results, studies using whole-brain measures of functional connectivity, in combination with machine learning algorithms, have demonstrated that multivariate patterns of connectivity can successfully distinguish patients from healthy controls. Using a multivariate classification approach, a recent study aimed at identifying biomarkers specifically for ASD found that application of their ASD model to other disorders was moderately successful in identifying SZ patients from healthy controls, but not those with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or major depressive disorder. This suggests that common cognitive deficits in the two disorders may be accompanied by common changes in connectivity. Studies designed to make direct comparisons between ASD and SZ may identify divergent features that make the two disorders unique, which can aid in the development of customized interventions. However, to our knowledge no previous studies have directly compared patterns of connectivity changes in ASD from those in SZ. Furthermore, it is unknown whether machine learning algorithms can be used to differentiate between the two disorders. In this study, we apply graph theoretical techniques to resting state brain activity in autistic and schizophrenic patient populations, building whole-brain models of effectivity connectivity between brain regions over time. Then, using supervised machine learning in combination with a feature selection algorithm, we identify features that are most diagnostic for each. We cross-validate the resulting machine learning models on independent training-naive data sets to determine if they generalize outside the training data sets.

One common approach is functional connectivity, which refers to temporal correlations signal intensity across brain regions. In this study, we utilize a Bayesian approach to determine effective connectivity between brain areas. Effective connectivity is a measure of the influence brain regions exert over each other over time. Using Bayes Nets to determine effective connectivity offers some advantage over functional connectivity measures in that they are less sensitive to motion artifacts. Whereas motion results in artificially altered correlation coefficients across the brain, the probabilistic determination of connections between variables in Bayesian models make them less susceptible to spurious connections resulting from motion artifacts. In this study, Bayesian network models were generated for each subject to represent the effective connectivity between ROIs. Bayesian network models are graphical models where variables (ROIs) are depicted as the nodes of the network and directed edges as the interactions between nodes. Connections between ROIs represent probabilistic dependencies among variables quantified by their conditional probability distributions. The network structure expresses the joint probability distribution over all variables. The structure of a Bayesian network model representing the interactions between each of the ROIs over the scan duration is learned from the ROI time series data using a score-based hill-climbing greedy search algorithm as implemented in the R bnlearn package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bnlearn/index.html). Such algorithms have been benchmarked for use in fMRI data and have demonstrated excellent accuracy and stability over known network structures.

An SVM is a supervised multivariate classification method that treats each of the features, or edges, as a point in a high dimensional space. Training of an SVM results in a set of support vectors (points in multidimensional feature-space) that represent the boundary between classes. Because the support vectors are at the boundary between classes, they are not useful in determining features that are most indicative of each class. We identify the most indicative features using recursive feature elimination (RFE). The basic principle of RFE is to initially include all edges in the model and to gradually exclude edges, that do not contribute in discriminating between the two classes. This approach iteratively trains and tests the SVM, discarding the least important features at each iteration until a core set of features remain, having the highest discriminative power. At each iteration, data from the training set is randomly sub-divided into training and testing sets consisting of 10% of the total number of subjects. After training, the least significant 10% of features are removed from the feature set. Feature significance is based on the support vector model coefficients. Classification accuracy on the held out 10% of subjects is recorded at each iteration. A bootstrap procedure was implemented that repeats the RFE process 100 times. Accuracies are averaged over the 100 bootstrap samples. The number of features to include in the final model was determined by choosing the number that yielded the highest classification accuracy on average over the 100 bootstrap samples. Edge features were sorted according to the frequency (1\u2013100) of their inclusion in the top feature set yielding highest accuracy.

The procedure resulted in maximum average accuracy over 100 bootstrap samples using 4500 features. SVM models for classification of the ASD training set were generated by training an SVM on a range of between 100 and 4500 of the top RFE determined features. Classification accuracy dropped steeply if fewer than 100 of these diagnostic features were used. In order to determine whether the model generalizes to ASD patients outside of this set, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of these features on an independent testing data set. The features were used to predict the identity of subjects in the training-naive ASD ABIDEII-BNI test data set. Receiver operator curves (ROCs) were generated to show classification accuracy on the training-naive data set as a function of the number of the top features used (Fig. 1a). An ROC is a visual representation of the sensitivity and specificity of the model. Sensitivity is the ability to correctly identify ASD subjects or the true positive rate (TPR). Specificity is the ability to correctly identify healthy individuals or 1\u202f\u2212\u202ffalse positive rate (1\u202f\u2212\u202fFPR). A perfect model would have 100% sensitivity (TPR\u202f=\u202f1) and specificity (FPR\u202f=\u202f0). Note that the SVM was never trained on the test data set. Rather, SVM models generated on the training data set with different numbers of the top features identified through the RFE procedure were used to predict the identity of subjects in the ASD test data set. Over a range between 800 and 1000 of the top RFE-determined features, the models performed well, with accuracies of 83% (75% sensitivity and 89% specificity) on the ASD test data set (Table 1). Therefore these edges represent the features that are most diagnostic for ASD and generalize across data sets.

To test the generalizability of these features in their ability to distinguish ASD from SZ subjects, these features were used to predict group membership in ASD and SZ subjects from the validation data sets. Again, the SVM model was trained on the training data sets and the resulting model was used to predict membership in the validation set based on this model. As in the other validation procedures, we explored the diagnostic utility of the features for the purpose of distinguishing ASD from SZ subjects by using different numbers of the most significant features determined from the SVM model parameter weights resulting from training on the training data sets (Table 3). Using 40\u201350 features we obtained 75% accuracy when predicting class membership in the ASD and SZ validation data sets (Fig. 6). When examining the edge weights of these features in ASD and SZ patients (Fig. 7) a striking difference in the pattern of increases and decreases is readily apparent. In the feature set that distinguishes ASD from SZ subjects, ASD is characterized by increases rather than decreases in connectivity strength in nearly all connections between and within networks. While DMN connectivity is prominent in the feature sets for both disorders, the DMN is also the most diagnostic network for distinguishing ASD from SZ. Examining the specific edges involved, SZ exhibited decreased connectivity strength in all DMN connections except those between the posterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex, and between the precuneus and lateral occipital cortex.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34365, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34376, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "From a diagnostic point of view, there is considerable interest in identifying biomarkers for psychiatric disorders such as ASD and SZ. However, there is a recognition that symptoms in many psychiatric disorders lie along a continuum with some degree of overlap across disorders. Despite the similarities between ASD and SZ, particularly in social cognitive deficits and their overlapping etiologies, they are seldom studied comparatively. In their separate literatures, aberrant connectivity has been the focus of study in both ASD and SZ, because it is believed that their cognitive deficits may be caused by the impaired ability to integrate information across functionally distributed brain areas. However, studies of connectivity differences in both ASD and SZ have yielded conflicting results, particularly those that have focused on average connectivity changes between specific brain regions. This highlights the difficulty of using regional connectivity differences between just one or two regions to characterize complex disorders such as ASD and SZ. Even if individual features did reach statistical significance, this would not be sufficient for use as a biomarker, since there is still considerable overlap in the distributions of regional connectivity strengths between patients and controls. Multivariate pattern analysis, on the other hand, can reliably distinguish patients from healthy controls by identifying a set of features that in combination best describe the deviations from normal connectivity patterns. In addition, this technique makes use of the mixture of increases and decreases in regional connectivity strength to help distinguish groups. In contrast, univariate techniques typically require averaging over regional changes which may account for some of the conflicting results in the literature.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36206, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Classification accuracy", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36230, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For both SZ and ASD, we generated SVM models on an optimized set of diagnostic features identified through a feature elimination procedure.

We obtained 83% accuracy on the ASD validation data set and 80% accuracy on the SZ validation data set. Many studies using multivariate classifiers have been previously carried out for both disorders (see and for schizophrenia review; autism). The overwhelming majority of such studies cross-validate their models using a leave one out, leave two out, or 10-fold cross validation scheme. Very few test the generalization of their models on independent data sets. For example, in one recent study of ASD 81% classification accuracy was achieved using SVM and leave two out cross validation of MRI structural images. They identified differences in grey matter structure in frontal, parietal, and limbic regions as well as the basal ganglia. In another large multi-site study of 964 autistics, 60% accuracy was achieved using functional connectivity and leave one out cross-validation. They identified features in DMN, temporal regions and the intraparietal sulcus. Similar studies have been carried out in the schizophrenia literature. One such study reported 85% classification accuracy using SVM with 10-fold cross validation on functional connectivity measures. Another study achieved 93% accuracy using Fishers' linear discriminant analysis. Their analysis identified the DMN, temporal and visual regions as the most significant classification features. By testing our classification models on independent data sets over a range of the top diagnostic features, we showed that the features determined to have the most predictive power on our training data sets, determined based on the SVM model coefficients, generalized to independent training-naive data sets and that validation accuracies decrease as the number of diagnostic features becomes insufficient.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38382, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Divergent features of ASD and SZ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38415, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The diagnostic features we identified through the RFE procedure were distributed across the brain, which supports the hypothesis that impaired integration of information across distributed brain areas is a hallmark of both ASD and SZ. Both disorders exhibited a large number of changes in connectivity in the DMN and salience networks. However, the two disorders dissociate in terms of the specific pattern of alterations. ASD showed a greater proportion of within-network changes in the DMN and reduced connectivity between DMN and language areas. In contrast, SZ changes between DMN and language areas were largely increases in connectivity. Diametric changes in connectivity were also identified within the ECN where ASD exhibited largely decreases in connectivity relative to controls and SZ largely increases. The ECN is involved in execution of voluntary control of behavioral responses to salient stimuli and has been identified as a loci of changes in connectivity in SZ. It is unclear however whether changes in ECN associated with ASD are a primary cause of dysfunction or the result of dysfunction in lower-level sensory processing. In fact, a much larger proportion of diagnostic features were found in sensory-motor regions in ASD than were identified in SZ patients. The role of the sensory-motor cortex in social cognition has been studied in the context of the mirror-neuron system, where it is believed that individuals make sense of the actions and emotions of others. Mirror neurons were originally discovered in the pre-motor cortex of macaque monkeys. They are known to fire during goal-oriented motor action, but also in response to observing the same action performed by another individual. Previous studies have indicated dysfunction of the mirror-neuron system in both ASD and SZ patients. In addition, the ASD model required more features for accurate classification than were required for SZ subjects. This may be due to the onset of the disorder early during brain development. It has been suggested that early changes in sensory processing of facial features, for example, lead to changes in the perceived salience of such features and eventually to altered attentional processing and social impairments in ASD. Therefore, aberrant function and connectivity early in development may lead to compound changes later in development for higher level skills that are dependent on more elementary or sensory-level function.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40862, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Common features of ASD and SZ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40892, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The ability to behave in a context appropriate manner is dependent on recognition of socially relevant sensory information, and inferences based on learned constructs such as theory of mind. Accordingly, in our study, the overwhelming majority of diagnostic features identified for both ASD and SZ are in the salience and default mode networks. The DMN is believed to be essential to theory of mind abilities, while the salience network contributes to a variety of cognitive abilities including communication, social behavior and self-awareness. Both networks have been previously implicated in a variety of brain disorders including SZ and ASD. For example, in autism is it known that the relative salience of social queues including facial expressions are impaired. In schizophrenia, misattribution of salience to external and internal stimuli may be a cause of positive symptoms such as hallucinations. The DMN is an important part of association cortex. The DMN has connections to supplementary motor areas, frontal eye fields involved in control of visual attention, and reciprocal connections to thalamic nuclei that in-turn connect exclusively with higher association cortices. While there is little debate that the DMN is activated during theory of mind and other self-reflexive tasks, the function of the DMN is not well understood. Many studies have identified the DMN as a collection of areas that are structural and functional hubs, acting as a common connection point for many other brain areas. The DMN may play a key role in integrating executive control and salience networks, as was reported recently in the context of an n-back working memory task. As the task load elevated, functional connectivity increased between the salience network and the default mode and executive control networks. Interestingly, there is evidence that the DMN may integrate with salience networks in a graded manner. In a very large study of resting state functional connectivity, smoothly varying gradients of connectivity were found between each region of the DMN and salience network. These connectivity gradients were found to strengthen with maturity. It is possible that aberrant balance between these gradients of connectivity develop as a result of improper pruning and fine tuning over the course of development leading to dysfunction. Therefore, the changing interaction of these networks over the course of brain development is one possible explanation for why cognitive deficits similar to those of ASD do not manifest in SZ till early adulthood. A graded response between key networks may also contribute to the spectrum of cognitive deficits observed when this system is compromised.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 43586, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Discriminating ASD from SZ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 43613, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A small subset of the common and divergent features that distinguished either ASD or SZ from controls had diagnostic importance for classifying ASD from SZ subjects.

Positive symptoms associated with SZ, such as hallucinations, are one of the main characteristics that distinguish SZ from ASD. Positive symptoms in SZ are reportedly correlated with increased functional connectivity between the posterior regions of the DMN and the salience network. Our results suggest that such increases involve connections specifically between the posterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex, and between the precuneus and lateral occipital cortex. In addition, some studies have indicated that negative symptoms in SZ, such as impaired social cognition, are associated with decreased connectivity with anterior parts of the DMN in medial prefrontal cortex. Impaired social cognition related to theory of mind abilities, tasks that typically recruit DMN structures, has also consistently been associated with reduced activation of the DMN in ASD.

Future work should explore similar analysis using a voxel level approach to determine if there are better features to use for this purpose. Additionally, because we did not have access to symptom severity measures in our schizophrenic patients, we were not able to explicitly associate common connectivity differences in ASD and SZ to measures of symptom severity in SZ patients.
