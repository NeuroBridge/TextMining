Waveforms were averaged into 10 ms bins and analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA (Group \u00d7 Saccade Type) at each time bin. To control for increased family-wise error rate due to multiple comparisons, a clustering method (Forman et al., 1995) was used to take account of the non-independence of data from adjacent time bins (for examples, see Hamm et al. 2012; Hudgens-Haney et al., 2013; and Monte Carlo simulations, Cox, 1996).
