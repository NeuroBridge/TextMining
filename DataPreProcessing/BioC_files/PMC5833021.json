It is thought that a variety of brain regions participate in representations of the subjective value of stimuli and rewards, as well as the use of these representations in the guidance of choice and the updating of these value representations, following the integration of outcomes.

While the vmPFC has been linked to the representation of both expected and obtained value, it has also been described as a component of the default mode network. While anterior cingulate has been implicated in the representation of the expected value of actions, it has also been tied to the representation of the expected cost of actions, as well as the resolution of response conflict and the integration of negative feedback. Finally, the anterior insula has been linked not only to the signaling of aversive outcomes, but also the anticipation of aversive outcomes, as well as the signaling of salient outcomes, without respect to valence. Understanding the probable role played by nodes in frontostriatal circuits at a given time will likely depend on 1) the identification of distinct functional subregions of these larger brain areas, and 2) the characterization of network activity, as a whole, during the performing of specific aspects of reinforcement learning and decision making.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25419, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25431, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One potential confound for the interpretation of the results of this study is the fact that all schizophrenia patients in the study, except one, were treated with antipsychotic medications. When we computed correlations between measures of brain activity and doses of antipsychotic drugs, however, we observed no significant correlations between haloperidol-equivalent antipsychotic drug dose and any of the neural signals showing systematic relationships with negative symptom ratings. Therefore, there is little indication that antipsychotic medication status drove the observed relationships between negative symptom severity and value-related neural signals. While it is likely that effective pharmacological treatment restricted the range of positive symptoms in our patients, there is little evidence that antipsychotics, as currently used (including second-generation antipsychotics), have an effect on negative symptom severity (in terms of either improvement or exacerbation; 45\u201347). Based on the fact that we observed a significant correlation between APD dose and residual positive symptom severity, we believe that the observed correlations between antipsychotic dose and RL-related brain responses are likely secondary to the fact that the most symptomatic patients in our study were taking the highest doses of antipsychotic medication. Thus, we are confident that our results represent an effect of illness on reward circuit functioning, and not an effect of psychotropic medication.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26930, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A second limitation of the results presented above is the fact that we tested our predictions using a large number of t-tests and correlation analyses.

Furthermore, we found systematic relationships, in SZ patients, between negative symptom scores and value-related signals. We interpret these findings as evidence that motivational deficits in psychotic illness may, in part, result from reduced ability to differentially signal gains and instances of loss-avoidance in the brain, leading to compromised ability to form adaptive representations of the expected value of choices. Given the growing interest in trans-diagnostic mechanisms of apathy and avolition, future studies should seek to determine whether the relationships observed in this study are unique to schizophrenia, or if measures of apathy and avolition relate systematically to value-related neural signals in conditions such as mood disorders and degenerative disorders.
