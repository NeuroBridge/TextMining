Despite current efforts to legalize cannabis, little is known about the long-term effects of cannabis abuse (CA) on brain function and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Of particular concern has been the association between regular CA and psychiatric symptoms such as amotivation, negative emotionality and a heightened risk for psychosis. Indeed, CA was associated with up to a 6 fold increase in the risk of schizophrenia in early-onset users and with the use of cannabis with high THC. The increased risk remains after controlling for other substances of abuse and for familial risk of psychosis. Aberrant dopaminergic function in the midbrain-striatal circuitry, a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, may underlie this association. Accordingly, CA with genetic variants that confer high midbrain-striatal dopamine (DA), including the DRD2 rs1076560 T allele, the DAT1 3\u2032 9-repeat allele, and the AKT1 rs2494732 C allele, have an increased risk of psychosis compared with CA that do not have these genetic variants.

For instance, functional connectivity between reward processing regions, such as nucleus accumbens (NAc) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), appears to be related to disrupted DA function, and as such, has clinical relevance: higher intrinsic connectivity correlated with amotivation syndrome and with the duration that schizophrenia had been left untreated.

We recently used this method to identify functional connectivity changes that were associated with cognitive and mood-related behaviors in heavy drinkers. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of CA on subcortical functional hub organization, and its relevance to negative emotionality, which is elevated in CA and schizophrenia. Intriguingly, recent studies using a very similar approach found subcortical hyperconnectivity in a cohort of 95 individuals with Schizophrenia. We hypothesized similar effects may be observed in CA. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the large dataset produced by the Human Connectome Project. While the HCP does not have targeted measures that specifically assess psychosis, they do offer measures of negative emotionality, a symptom shared between CA and Schizophrenia that we have previously found to be associated with subcortical dopaminergic function in CA.

Indeed, using PET and [11C]raclopride to measure DA-induced changes to methylphenidate we found that CA when compared to controls showed increased DA release in the midbrain, though they showed an attenuated response in striatal regions. Functional connectivity between VS and VTA is higher in patients with Schizophrenia with symptoms of hyperdopaminergia, such as auditory and visual hallucinations, than in patients who do not experience these symptoms. Further, in healthy adults and in rats, drugs that increase (levodopa) and decrease (haloperidol) DA signaling have been demonstrated to increase and decrease functional connectivity of these regions, respectively. However, it is important to note that the findings from these seed-based connectivity studies are likely network-specific, because abnormal DA levels attenuate the connectivity between different resting state networks. This may explain why CA show hypoconnectivity between nodes of the mesolimbic reward network and nodes of the salience network; e.g. between the dopaminergic midbrain and insula and between NAc and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly, our seed-based connectivity analysis from these regions did not yield significant group differences. Thus, while previous studies have observed long-range subcortical-cortical connectivity alterations in CA, the current results appear to be confined to local hub differences in subcortical circuits. There are at least two possible explanations for this. First, this study carefully controlled for factors such as alcohol and tobacco usage, which may have influenced findings from previous studies. Second, the HCP uses a high-resolution sequence with an aggressive multiband factor, and this contributes to lower subcortical signal-to-noise ratio than is observed with low-resolution sequences. lFCD is more resilient to noise than seed-voxel correlations because lFCD capitalizes on locally shared synchrony and high sampling rate, which makes it possible to reach significant correlations in the absence of significant long-range synchrony. Nevertheless, our lFCD results seem to be broadly in line with previous studies using the FCD technique, although evidence is limited.

These results are also generally in line with the notion that altered connectivity in high-cost hubs is linked to neuropsychiatric disease burden. An important next step is to examine how tonic, resting subcortical hyperconnectivity may have consequences for phasic DA-dependent processes that are altered in CA, such as punishment-based learning. CA show altered subcortical activations and impaired learning from non-drug rewards and punishment. If higher resting subcortical lFCD is indeed due to higher tonic DA transmission, then this increased baseline activity would confer weaker ability to generate the \u201cdips\u201d in activity necessary to learn from negative outcomes, in line with extant models of dopaminergic function.

In correspondence, we find increased local thalamic connectivity while others found decreased thalamocortical connectivity in CA, and both are exacerbated in early-onset CA. In addition, CA show hyperactive thalamic responses to cannabis cues, which correlate with subjective craving of cannabis and are thought to contribute to sensorimotor deficits.

An initial investigation using structural MRI data found that effects of cannabis exposure on subcortical volumetry were minimal, but critically, they concluded that cannabis effects may be stronger in DA-rich regions including the VS and in the most frequent CA. Another diffusion-tensor imaging study examined 466 individuals reporting at least one lifetime experience with cannabis, and found that frequency of cannabis use did not associate with cortical volumes, but did associate with changes to the shape of the amygdala and hippocampus. Most notably, they observed that early-onset CA was associated with altered shape of the nucleus accumbens and loss of white matter integrity throughout the cortex. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to extend HCP investigations of CA to rsfMRI data. Because the HCP project is open access, there is a rich opportunity for further examination of the chronic effects of CA using a common dataset.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26690, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26702, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The HCP does not have in vivo measures of subcortical DA release or receptor function, and so we could not directly assess the hypothesis of hyperdopaminergia and psychosis risk in CA. Resting-state lFCD is an indirect measure of neuronal activity and the true neurobiological basis of this measure needs further exploration. Further, how exactly hyperdopaminergia manifests at the neural level is disputed. While CA with psychosis do not show elevated striatal DA release, stimulant-induced changes in DA correlate with psychosis, suggesting that hyperdopaminergia may be more related to postsynaptic hypersensitivity than to total levels of synaptic DA. Nevertheless, the final release of the HCP will include single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for all participants; future studies should examine how genetic differences predicting D2/3 function, e.g. Taq1A and C957T SNPs, predict risk for CA and subcortical lFCD, which would help shed light on this issue. Additionally, it remains unknown whether emotional disturbance is directly caused by CA or if individuals use cannabis to self-medicate feelings of negative emotionality. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that subcortical hyperconnectivity may be associated with cannabis withdrawal and the extent to which it abates with prolonged abstinence, as has been observed with other functional connectivity abnormalities in CA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28101, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28112, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite increased usage of cannabis worldwide, little is known about the neuropsychiatric effects of CA, especially in early-onset users.
