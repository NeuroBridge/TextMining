Fear extinction critically depends on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Here we tested if this same region plays a role in extinction of non-fear, drug and pleasant cue associations. Eighteen chronic cocaine users and 15 matched controls completed three functional MRI scans. Participants first learned to associate an abstract cue (the conditioned stimulus, CS) with a drug-related (CSD+) or pleasant (CSP+) image. Extinction immediately followed where each CS was repeatedly presented without the corresponding image. Participants underwent a second identical session 24 h later to assess retention of extinction learning. Results showed that like fear extinction, non-fear based extinction relies on the VMPFC. However, extinction-related changes in the VMPFC differed by cue valence and diagnosis. In controls, VMPFC activation to the CSD+ (which was unpleasant for participants) gradually increased as in fear extinction, while it decreased to the CSP+, consistent with a more general role of the VMPFC in flexible value updating. Supporting a specific role in extinction retention, we further observed a cross-day association between VMPFC activation and skin conductance, a classic index of conditioned responses. Finally, cocaine users showed VMPFC abnormalities for both CSs, which in the case of the CSD+, correlated with craving. These data suggest a global deficit in extinction learning in this group that may hinder extinction-based treatment efforts.

While a similar (increased) VMPFC activation is observed in fear extinction studies, VMPFC response to the CSP+ (cue associated with the affectively pleasant image) and an alternate appetitive CS (cue associated with monetary gain; see Supporting Information) instead decreased during extinction learning, consistent with a value updating process. Finally, while controls showed these distinct VMPFC response profiles, cocaine-addicted individuals, who manifest deficits in the VMPFC, did not, suggesting that the VMPFC, when intact, supports extinction learning in diverse contexts including of drug cue and pleasant associations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25218, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "That activation in the VMPFC might reflect a shift from a more valenced state (unpleasant as for the CSD+, or pleasant as for the CSP+) to a less valenced or neutral state follows from a large body of work showing that the VMPFC represents the value of a wide range of (appetitive and aversive) stimuli to guide behavior. While this more general role of the VMPFC in extinction has been previously hypothesized, direct empirical support has been limited as neuroimaging studies have almost exclusively focused on fear extinction. Animal work shows that the infralimbic cortex (the rodent homologue of the VMPFC) is involved in extinction of both appetitive and aversive CSs. In these studies inactivation of the infralimbic cortex impairs extinction as well as extinction recall for CSs that during acquisition predicted shocks [e.g., ], but seems to facilitate extinction for CSs that during acquisition predicted appetitive reinforcers [e.g., sugar ]. While additional studies are clearly needed to determine if the same VMPFC-mediated mechanism underlies extinction for all types of CSs, we speculate that the VMPFC stores the current value of the CS, likely in concert with other regions which themselves represent specific features of the CS (e.g., the amygdala in the case of aversive CSs, the striatum in the case of appetitive CSs).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26559, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In a previous fear extinction study, reduction in SCR during extinction correlated with VMPFC activation a day later, suggesting the VMPFC is specifically involved in the retrieval of extinction learning. We saw this same relationship here: lower SCR during day 1 extinction correlated with higher VMPFC activation during day 2 extinction. This relationship to SCR is supported by evidence that the VMPFC, unlike a more dorsal medial region of the prefrontal cortex typically implicated in the expression of conditioned associations (namely the dorsal anterior cingulate), granger causally drives changes in skin conductance. Despite differences in the activity profiles of the VMPFC for the CSD+ versus the CSP+, however, for both CSs, SCR decreased during extinction relative to acquisition. This cue-insensitive SCR pattern is not surprising given that SCR indexes arousal, and is consistent with that observed in extinction learning studies of food- and shock-paired CSs. Importantly, despite eliciting similar SCRs, valence ratings clearly differentiated the CSs as appetitive or aversive in this prior study. Thus, as indices of the conditioned response, VMPFC BOLD and SCR might represent partly distinct aspects of the CS (valence versus arousal).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27815, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Perhaps most strikingly, while controls showed parametric VMPFC changes over the learning phases, which were modulated by CS type, chronic cocaine users did not. This was the case for both CSs, pointing to a generalized VMPFC abnormality in this group. Speaking to the clinical relevance of this finding, cocaine users who were more successful at modulating their VMPFC response to the CSD+ during day 1 extinction (i.e., who looked more like controls) reported greater reductions in craving 24 h later. While these data predict that cocaine-addicted individuals with greater VMPFC impairments may be particularly vulnerable in real-world situations involving drug cues, the SCR data did not reveal differences from controls. We used SCR as a passive measure of the conditioned response consistent with a large body of literature. However, SCR is a noisy measurement in the MRI environment (indeed, there was substantial data loss that may have reduced our power to detect group differences in SCR if these differences existed). Alternatively, however, these neural differences might exist outside overt SCR differences. In studies of anxiety disorders, for example, reproducible VMPFC impairments during fear extinction and its later retrieval are observed in the absence of abnormalities in SCR. That is, VMPFC activation might be more sensitive in detecting differences from health, although this possibility remains an open empirical question. To directly test this possibility, future studies could incorporate trial-by-trial expectancy ratings as explicit measures of learning and additional physiological indices of arousal (e.g., pupil dilation) and valence [e.g., startle potentiation/attenuation ].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29524, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Contrary to expectations, the groups differed only in the VMPFC. Activation in the striatum mirrored that of the VMPFC, increasing in response to the CSD+ and decreasing in response to the CSP+ as extinction progressed, but there were no differences between cocaine users and controls. This coordinated pattern of activation in the VMPFC and striatum, another central node within the valuation system, further supports a value-sensitive account of extinction learning. But while we and others consistently find structural and functional impairments in stimulant users in the VMPFC, that in some cases persist long after drug use ceases, a similar consensus finding regarding the striatum has been difficult to ascertain from the human neuroimaging literature, with a bulk of studies showing intact or even enhanced striatum function [see for a detailed discussion on this topic].

For the former, the indirect dopamine agonist methylphenidate has been shown to enhance extinction and its retention, possibly via local effects in the infralimbic cortex. This pharmacological approach may be particularly well-suited for cocaine-addicted individuals as prior studies in this population show that methylphenidate bolsters VMPFC function on both emotionally salient and emotionally neutral tasks. Methylphenidate is also shown to modulate resting functional connectivity with the VMPFC. For the latter aim (decreasing reliance on the VMPFC), post-retrieval extinction, which interferes with memory reconsolidation, may offer a more efficacious method for targeting drug-related associations. Indeed, post-retrieval extinction is shown to be effective at reducing reinstatement and/or renewal of drug-, sugar-, and fear-related associations in rodents and humans. Some of this procedure\u2019s success is attributed to its relative independence of the VMPFC, and may therefore represent a viable alternative for disorders with compromises in this region such as addiction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31857, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, a hallmark feature of drug addiction is an inability to discontinue drug seeking and use despite reduced pleasure derived from the drug and a range of negative consequences including the foregoing of other potentially rewarding outcomes.

A second extinction training session took place 24 h later. A typical paired trial consisted of presentation of the CS for 3.5 s, followed by presentation of the US (the corresponding image) inside the CS for 1.5 s, a variable ~1.5 s fixation screen, and a 1 s screen requiring a non-contingent button press indicating whether the US appeared or not on that trial.
