It remains untested whether concurrent antipsychotic medications exert pharmacodynamic interactions that mitigate pro-cognitive action in patients. We used functional MRI (fMRI) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject crossover test of single-dose modafinil effects in 27 medicated schizophrenia patients, interrogating brainstem regions where catecholamine systems arise to innervate the cortex, to link cellular and systems-level models of cognitive control. Modafinil effects were evaluated both within this patient group and compared to a healthy subject group. Modafinil modulated activity in the locus coeruleus (LC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the patient group. However, compared to the healthy comparison group, these effects were altered as a function of task demands: the control-independent drug effect on deactivation was relatively attenuated (shallower) in the LC and exaggerated (deeper) in the VTA; in contrast, again compared to the comparison group, the control-related drug effects on positive activation were attenuated in LC, VTA and the cortical cognitive control network. These altered effects in the LC and VTA were significantly and specifically associated with the degree of antagonism of alpha-2 adrenergic and dopamine-2 receptors, respectively, by concurrently prescribed antipsychotics. These sources of evidence suggest interacting effects on catecholamine neurons of chronic antipsychotic treatment, which respectively increase and decrease sustained neuronal activity in LC and VTA.

Computational modeling suggests that modest slowing of tonic background activity of catecholamine neurons may be ideal for enhancing their responsiveness to task-relevant stimuli. This can be achieved pharmacologically with moderate inhibition of plasma-membrane catecholamine transport, which increases catecholamine-mediated activation of inhibitory cell-body autoreceptors (Fig. 1a). We have previously shown that modafinil, a low-potency inhibitor of transporters for NE (NET) and DA (DAT) (reviewed in ref.) modulates the LC and the cortical network subserving cognitive control, in a manner consistent with this cellular model of pro-cognitive action.

For example, antipsychotics exert strong effects that decrease neuronal activity in VTA-DA neurons while increasing tonic activity in LC-NE neurons. These effects would then alter the responses of these brain areas to candidate agents that modulate catecholamine systems.

This contrast uses all available data to estimate treatment effects that are independent of Task Condition, i.e., cognitive control demands. We hypothesized that in this contrast, significant drug effects (relative to placebo) would be manifest as deactivations in both the LC and the VTA, attendant to the model of catecholamine neurotransmission at cell bodies, an effect well-established for catecholamine transporter inhibitors such as stimulants and antidepressants. In contrast, for the control-related treatment effect on brain activity, the contrast was established as (Drug_RedCue minus Drug_GreenCue)\u2009>\u2009(Placebo_RedCue minus Placebo_GreenCue). This is analogous to a directional test of the Treatment-by-Task Condition interaction in ANOVA terminology, and in this contrast, we hypothesized that the Drug would serve to positively enhance LC and VTA activity. This is because despite a control-independent effect of Drug manifest as deactivation, the drug should augment the positive difference in activity related to cognitive control demands (i.e., Red Cue over Green Cue-related activity), as the cellular model suggests that a modest decrease in tonic firing rates should be associated with an increased phasic (i.e., task-related) firing rate, as an expression of gain control in neural activity.

We found that modafinil administration leads to relative deactivation in LC and VTA in schizophrenia patients, consistent with predictions of control-independent effects arising from NET and DAT inhibition at cell bodies in these subcortical regions (Fig. 1a). Importantly, these effects were altered compared to a healthy control group, with two lines of evidence suggesting an interaction with the concurrent antipsychotic medications prescribed to these patients was responsible for these altered responses. First, relative to the healthy control group, the patients responded to modafinil with shallower deactivation in LC and deeper deactivation in VTA. This pattern is consistent with the underlying effects of chronic antipsychotic medication treatment, which lead to sustained decreases in tonic firing in the VTA, and increases in tonic firing in the LC. Second, these altered modafinil effects in the LC and VTA were significantly correlated respectively with antagonism at \u03b12 and D2 receptors (despite the relatively simple measure of receptor load used here), These receptor subtypes serve an important regulatory autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of NE and DA neurons, respectively. In the patients overall, the consequences of altered responses to modafinil was that the drug was less able to positively modulate control-related increases in activity, in both these subcortical regions and in neocortical and subcortical terminal fields that support cognitive control (see Fig. 1b for hypothetical model of altered modafinil effects on catecholamine neuron activity in SZ).

The tonic disinhibition of LC-NE neurons may then mitigate or override the feedback inhibition of LC-NE activity via cell-body autoreceptors, which would be manifest as the shallower control-independent deactivation in patients that we observed by fMRI. Given the relationship of tonic to phasic LC activity, proxied here respectively as control-independent and control-related BOLD signal change, this increased tonic LC activity (unnormalized by modafinil) would impede relative control-related increases in LC-NE activity. We have observed just this combination of control-independent and control-related drug effects in our patient sample. It remains unclear which monoamine receptor(s) mediates the antipsychotic effect on LC activity. However, we found that the \u03b12 antagonist load of the concurrent antipsychotics was strongly and specifically related to impaired modafinil effects on control-related LC activity. This convergent evidence suggests that antagonism of the cell-body \u03b12 autoreceptor leads to impaired optimization of control-related phasic LC activity. This evidence supports the model we outlined previously, where modafinil action to inhibit NET at LC cell bodies leads to autoreceptor-mediated slowing of control-independent LC activity, allowing optimized control-related phasic LC activity to effectively modulate the cognitive control network (Fig. 1b).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27632, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In contrast to the activating effects on the LC, chronic antipsychotic treatment induces depolarization inactivation in VTA-DA neurons, rendering the cell-body less able to generate action potentials (reviewed in). The relatively depolarized (but not discharging) state of antipsychotic-exposed VTA-DA neurons may then render these neurons relatively more sensitive to DAT inhibitor effects that increase DA at cell bodies. This increased sensitivity could also result from relatively more D2 receptors in a high-affinity state, which is induced with chronic antipsychotic treatment and associated with the D2 affinity of these medications. One of the present findings, that the deactivating effect of modafinil on the VTA was significantly related to the D2 load conferred by the patients\u2019 concurrent antipsychotic medications, suggests that D2-receptor effects interact with modafinil responses in the VTA. Exaggerated deactivation of the VTA to modafinil could render these neurons suboptimally-responsive to control-related excitatory inputs, leading to the dissociation of cell-body vs. terminal effects of DAT inhibition (see penultimate paragraph below). This effect may also interact with underlying pathophysiology in this system, manifest in either neurochemical disturbances and/or altered responses to cognitive demands.

Phasic activity in both VTA and LC neurons leads to greater neurotransmitter release compared to tonic activity, and optimizes throughput in active cortical ensembles, which may be mediated by D1 or \u03b12 receptors. It remains likely that modafinil exerts important actions at NET in terminals in the PFC, probably to amplify the beneficial effects of cell-body modulation. The D2-mediated antipsychotic effects observed here could also relate to actions at DA terminals in the PFC, and \u03b12 antagonist effects also manifest directly at post-synaptic receptors in PFC, both leading to altered descending cortical input to the LC and VTA. Antipsychotic treatment may in fact induce a state where cell-body, terminal and post-synaptic actions are uncoupled in response to catecholamine transport inhibition. In this scenario, antipsychotic treatment leads to: (1) altered effects of pro-cognitive NET/DAT inhibition on cell-body activity (observed here), combined with (2) increased release of residual NE and DA, resulting from both terminal autoreceptor antagonism (by antipsychotics) plus NET and DAT inhibition (by modafinil), but in a manner uncoupled to cell-body activity (and the influence of control-related excitatory input to catecholamine neurons from the PFC and elsewhere), and (3) direct antagonism by antipsychotics of post-synaptic D2 and \u03b12 receptors in the cortex.
