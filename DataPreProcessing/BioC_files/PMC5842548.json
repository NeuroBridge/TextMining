In order to assess relationships between abnormal patterns of FC during intrinsic activity and those during extrinsic activity, we adopted a data-fusion approach and applied partial least square (PLS) analyses to FC datasets from 25 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 25 age- and sex-matched normal controls. For the input to the PLS analyses, we generated a pair of FC maps during the resting state (REST) and the auditory deviance response (ADR) from each participant using the common seed region in the left middle temporal gyrus, which is a focus of activity associated with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). PLS correlation (PLS-C) analysis revealed that patients with schizophrenia have significantly lower loadings of a component containing positive FCs in default-mode network regions during REST and a component containing positive FCs in the auditory and attention-related networks during ADR. Specifically, loadings of the REST component were significantly correlated with the severities of positive symptoms and AVH in patients with schizophrenia. The co-occurrence of such altered FC patterns during REST and ADR was replicated using PLS regression, wherein FC patterns during REST are modeled to predict patterns during ADR.

Given the recent accumulation of findings using a single MRI methodology, the need for the integration of multiple datasets has become a pivotal issue in neuroimaging. Indeed, data-fusion analysis using multivariate statistical techniques has turned out to be effective in revealing latent patterns of brain features that are found in multiple datasets collected from the same individual. For instance, a recent study adopted the partial least square (PLS) method to integrate diffusion-weighted images and resting-state fMRI data collected from the same individuals and revealed latent patterns of structural and functional connectivity co-occurring in typically developed adults.

Based on numerous previous studies showing that auditory and speech-related areas underlie various schizophrenia symptoms, particularly AVH, we focused on the left lateral temporal cortex as the primary candidate for the common seed for REST and ADR.

The procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1. A pair of FC maps, REST and ADR, generated by seeding the left MTG/STS in each individual were separately flattened into two rows, which were then fed into row vectors in X and Y data matrices, respectively. Therefore, the X and Y matrices had 50 rows and their number of columns corresponded to the number of voxels in the FC maps of REST and ADR. A standard approach for solving the PLS-C problem is to apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to the covariance matrix XTY, which represents the covariance of all of the pairs of a voxel in one condition (i.e., REST) and those in another condition (i.e., ADR) across participants. Briefly, SVD generates a set of mutually orthogonal composite components by decomposing XTY into U\u0394VT, wherein U and V are matrices of left and right singular vectors and \u0394 is a diagonal matrix with singular values along the diagonal. Here, the ith composite component consists of the ith column vectors of matrices U and V and the ith singular value in matrix \u0394.

In this study, we used an alternative computationally efficient method proposed in a previous study. Briefly, during the decomposition of XTY into U\u0394VT, XTYYTX may be represented as U\u03942UT and is related to eigenvalue decomposition.

Although a number of fMRI studies have reported abnormal brain FC or activity during either REST or ADR, unsurprisingly, the identified patterns of abnormalities varied depending on the experimental paradigms used. Thus, the relationships among the multiple patterns of abnormal FC were unclear. As far as we know, the present study is the first study wherein data-fusion analysis is applied to two FC datasets collected from an identical set of participants. Here we successfully revealed the presence of linked latent abnormal FC patterns during REST and ADR. A previous study had adopted a similar strategy of collecting FC data during the resting state and an auditory oddball discrimination task from the same individuals. However, in that study, network abnormalities were estimated using separate comparisons of functional measures at the group level for the two conditions. When using a data-fusion approach, it is crucial to incorporate information regarding the associations of FC patterns during the different conditions at the individual participant level. Our approach thus represents a significant advancement in uncovering latent co-occurrences of abnormal FC patterns during intrinsic and extrinsic activity in individuals with schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46664, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In spite of the algorithmic and modeling differences between PLS-C and PLS-R, the two methods were consistent in revealing that the following patterns of altered FC during REST and ADR are linked in schizophrenia: (i) during REST, regions in the DMN and the primary visual network have reduced FC with the left MTG/STS; and (ii) during ADR, regions in the auditory network and the anterior saliency network have reduced FC with the left MTG/STS. Here, the left MTG/STS was chosen as the common seed region for the two conditions based on a meta-analysis of abnormal activity related to AVH. In addition, a previous fMRI study has shown that abnormal activity near the left MTG/STS is correlated with the severity of delusions in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, we suggest that the left MTG/STS has functional properties that satisfy the necessary conditions for it to be considered a critical node for abnormal FC networks that underlie psychotic symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47629, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the REST component maps, constellations of regions showing reduced FC with the left MTG/STS in patients with SCZ were highly consistent with those of the DMN and comprised the RSC, LIPC, anterior superior temporal sulcus, and posterior CC. Although there were some differences in the exact anatomical locations within the DMN between PLS-C and PLS-R (e.g., ventral vs. dorsal DMN), reduced FC in the DMN was clearly shown using both analyses. Furthermore, significant correlations with PANSS(P) in both PLS-C and PLS-R indicate that this abnormal pattern of FC is associated with positive symptoms. A significant correlation with AHRS, which is used to assess the severity of the AVH, was also clearly shown using PLS-C. These results may be consistent with the recent proposal that abnormal interactions between the auditory cortex and the DMN may underlie AVH in schizophrenia, assuming that the \u201cauditory cortex\u201d includes higher-order auditory association regions. Because the DMN consists of a set of regions involved in various forms of self-referential processing, functional abnormalities in the DMN have been thought to be linked to self-disturbance in schizophrenia. Our findings of reduced FC with the left MTG/STS may therefore represent neural abnormalities linking self-disturbance to the abnormal auditory experience of AVH in schizophrenia. In the ADR component map, on the other hand, PLS-C revealed reduced FC in the dorsal anterior CC and other regions in the anterior saliency and auditory networks in individuals with schizophrenia. The results of PLS-R were similar to those of PLS-C when more liberal thresholds were used. Such findings are in line with those of a previous fMRI study using the ADR paradigm to show reduced FC between the anterior CC and the bilateral auditory cortex in schizophrenia. Although associations with clinical scores were less clear when compared to those of the REST component, the correlation with PANSS (P) scores was significant, at least when using PLS-C.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49644, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It is notable that PLS analyses identified major FC alterations in the saliency network and DMN, both of which have been proposed to critically contribute to psychotic symptoms, particularly AVH. It has previously been suggested that atypical interactions among the DMN, saliency network, and central executive networks, together with altered FCs to the auditory language system, may underlie these schizophrenia symptoms. Using the left MTG/STS-seeded FC maps as input data for the PLS analyses, the present study was designed to examine abnormal FC between the auditory language system and other FC networks. Although the involvement of the central executive network was less clear, our PLS results were largely consistent with a report of aberrant FC among the DMN, saliency network, and auditory language network. Furthermore, the PLS analyses revealed that aberrant interactions involving these FC networks change in a task-dependent manner. Although FCs between the auditory language area and the saliency network should normally be more engaged during ADR than during REST, the FC was decreased during ADR and was increased during REST in individuals with schizophrenia when compared to healthy controls, as determined using PLS. This indicates that task-dependent modulation of FCs between the auditory language and saliency networks is altered in schizophrenia. On the other hand, it is expected that the auditory language area (task-positive) and DMN (task-negative) should normally be decoupled during the engagement of a task (i.e., ADR). However, when compared to healthy controls, our PLS analyses revealed increased FC between the auditory language area and DMN during ADR and decreased FC during REST in patients with schizophrenia. This observation is consistent with a recent report that unstable DMN activity is related to the occurrence of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Because the saliency network, particularly the anterior insula, plays a critical role in switching FC networks between DMN and a task-positive network, aberrant functions of the saliency network might underlie abnormal FC modulation between the DMN and the auditory language system in schizophrenia. The exact roles of abnormalities in each of these FC networks should be clarified in future studies. Nevertheless, our PLS results indicate that abnormal interactions among the DMN and the auditory language and saliency networks are critically involved in schizophrenia and its core clinical symptoms, as suggested in previous reports.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52191, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A few caveats of the methodology used here should be discussed. First, input FC maps for the PLS analyses were generated using a single seed (the left MTG/STS). Therefore, the identified patterns of abnormal FC in this study are likely to be only parts of the entire neural mechanism underlying schizophrenia, although the PLS is explorative analysis. In a meta-analysis of abnormal activity associated with AVH in schizophrenia, significant foci other than the left MTG included the left premotor cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Therefore, future studies should address whether and how FC networks involving these regions are related to schizophrenia and its core symptoms. Nevertheless, the voxel cluster in the left MTG was the largest of the significant clusters in the meta-analysis. We also note that the view of the left MTG/STS as a primary node of functional abnormality in schizophrenia is supported by abundant evidence for structural and functional alterations and their involvement in the core clinical symptoms of AVH and delusion. Second, in the PLS-C, a single component (component #3) was shown to be significant in permutation tests without corrections for multiple tests. The PLS-C results without corrections were corroborated by those of the PLS-R. In the PLS-R, the number of optimal components was determined to be 4 based on the cross-validation method. Among the 4 components, only a single composite component showed a highly significant group difference (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0022 for the REST component and p\u00a0=\u00a00.0023 for the ADR component). Results of the examination of spatial distributions of clusters of that component were highly similar to those obtained using the PLS-C, such that it contained reduced FCs in the default-mode network during REST and reduced FCs in auditory and attention-related networks during ADR. The consistent findings between the two analyses thus lend credence to the conclusion that abnormal FCs involving the default-mode network during REST and reduced FCs in auditory and attention-related networks during ADR are linked in the pathological processes underlying schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 54323, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we used PLS analyses to reveal the linked occurrence of reduced FC of the left MTG/STS with DMN regions during the resting state and reduced FC with auditory and anterior saliency network regions during the auditory deviance response in patients with schizophrenia.
