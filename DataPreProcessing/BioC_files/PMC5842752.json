Recent studies have linked rs1344706 to functional connectivity among specific brain regions. However, no study thus far has examined the role of this SNP in the entire functional connectome. In this study, we used degree centrality to test the role of rs1344706 in the whole-brain voxel-wise functional connectome during the resting state. 52 schizophrenia patients and 128 healthy controls were included in the final analysis.

Our recent study also found a significant association between the same SNP and schizophrenia. To identify the neural systems linked to this SNP, multiple fMRI studies using working memory tasks (e.g., the N-back task) have been reported. Although these studies did not find significant genotype effects on regional brain activation, they consistently found significant genotype effects on functional connectivity seeded from the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) to the left hippocampus formation (lHF). Our recent study reconstructed the fiberic and accordant functional subconnections between the rDLPFC and the lHF (with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCU) as the intervening nodes) and found a significant association between rs1344706 and PCC/PCU -lHF connection.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2937, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One limitation of the previous functional connectivity studies is that they relied on a priori selection of seeds.

Instead of using seeds, the new approach computes degree centrality (a measure of network in graph theory) of a specific grey matter voxel based on the total correlations of its time series with those of the rest of the network.

We hypothesized that the PCC/PCU may be one of the key brain regions linked to rs1344706 due to four reasons: (1) The PCC/PCU is an important brain hub in the human brain with high connectivities with other brain areas; (2) Perhaps due at least partially to such connectivities, cerebral blood flow and metabolic rate of the PCC/PCU are 40% greater than average; (3) Altered degree centrality of the

Due to their excessive head motion (>\u00a03\u00b0 or 3\u00a0mm) and failure of registration (due to low quality of T1 images), 3 patients and 9 healthy controls were excluded. Due to the small number of the minor-allele homozygotes (10 patients and 28 controls), we combined the CC genotype with the CA genotype as the non-risk allele carriers. The final data analysis included 52 schizophrenia patients (34 CA/CC and 18 AA) and 128 healthy controls (96 CA/CC and 32 AA). The patients were recruited from the inpatients of the Beijing Anding Hospital. All patients fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia according to the diagnostic consensus of two experienced psychiatrists based on structured interview (SCID). The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) was used to assess each patient's positive (SAPS) and negative (SANS) symptoms. The mean scores of the SAPS and SANS are shown in Table 1. All patients were treated with stable doses of atypical antipsychotics for >\u00a02\u00a0weeks. Antipsychotic drugs included clozapine (5 patients), olanzapine (13 patients), risperidone (22 patients), aripiprazole (6 patients), and haloperidol (6 patients). No antidepressants were involved. Patients took 2.5\u20135\u00a0mg diazepam occasionally for their insomnia. However, patients were asked not to take diazepam or other benzodiazepines on the night before the scan. If they did, their appointments for fMRI scans were canceled. Exclusion criteria for the patients included a history of other psychiatric disorders and severe brain injury (any closed or open injuries that may be related to current symptoms or cognitive functions), current substance abuse, and currently having acute psychotic episodes. The healthy controls were recruited from the same geographical region as the patients by advertisement and received unstructured clinical interview by experienced psychiatrists to screen for any personal or family history of psychiatric disorders. Most healthy controls were involved in our previous studies.

However, due to lacks of detailed information on diagnosis effect within PCC/PCU in the previous studies which could indicate the characteristic changes of schizophrenia patients, it is impossible to compare the direction of the interaction effect across different studies directly.

Such a conjecture would explain the fact that most previous fMRI studies using working memory tasks did not find significant effects of rs1344706 on regional brain activation, but instead found significant effects on functional connectivity. It needs to be mentioned that two fMRI studies using a theory-of-mind (ToM task consistently found significant effects of rs1344706 on the deactivation of PCC/PCU. As a key node of the DMN, the PCC/PCU may contribute to cognitive processing through its functional connections rather than its activation level. In that sense, our finding may help us to understand the above finding from the two fMRI studies using a ToM task. The energy demand of the PCU is very high due to its central role in optimizing overall brain communication. Accordingly, the PCU becomes one of the weakest points within the brain network and is vulnerable to any potential insult. Previous studies found that injuries to the hubs led to greater impairments of the brain's overall communication efficiency than did injuries to non-hub regions. Taken together, the finding that the risk allele homozygotes had significantly higher degree centrality at the PCU hub suggests that this region would have a higher demand for energy and hence greater susceptibility to dysfunctions including those leading to diseases such as schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19715, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to the significant interaction effect of genotype\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0diagnosis, the PCU also showed a significant diagnosis effect in this study.

There have been 4 other independent resting-state fMRI studies that found significant differences between patients and controls in degree centrality within PCC/PCU. Three previous studies and the current one reported increased degree centrality in PCC/PCU for schizophrenia patients, but one found decreased degree centrality in schizophrenia patients. The discrepancy between these results may have been due to the fact that four studies did not account for the global mean signal, whereas the fifth one did. Indeed, analyzed their data both ways\u2013with and without accounting for global mean signal \u2013and reported that the elevated degree centrality of PCC in schizophrenia patients was more obvious when global signals were not accounted for than when they were. Previously, the global mean signals at the resting-state were presumed to reflect physiological noise and were thus commonly accounted for.

Although the exact reason for the role of the DMN in symptoms of schizophrenia is still unknown, two properties of the DMN give us some hints. First, the DMN is very active when the mind is in a passive state or when the mind is involved in tasks that direct attention away from external stimuli. Some researchers have proposed the internal mentation hypothesis that the DMN directly supports internal mentation that is detached from the external world. It is possible that overactive DMN may weaken or even cut off the link between internal mentation and the external world in schizophrenia patients. Second, the DMN is closely connected to brain regions that are active during episodic memory such as the hippocampus. When the link between internal mentation and the external world was weakened, patients' thinking and judgement may rely more heavily on their own memory. As a result, they may produce many self-referential thoughts. As reported in one previous study, increased short-range functional connectivity at the PCU was associated with increased self-referential thoughts, which could further result in hallucinations. It needs to mention that the DMN is deactivated when performing tasks with high cognitive demands such as the ToM task. Some fMRI studies using a ToM task (to measure the ability to understand other people's mental states) have suggested that the significant rs1344706 genotype effect on the deactivation of the PCC/PCU may be due to delusional ideation in schizophrenia patients.
