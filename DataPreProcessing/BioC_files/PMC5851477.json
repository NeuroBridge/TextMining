Using resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), the insula has been shown to interact with constituent nodes of its own and other large-scale brain networks to influence endogenous and exogenous attention orientation via a hypothesized tripartite network model. Briefly, this model describes a Default Mode Network (DMN)\u2014including rostral and posterior cingulate cortices, parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal cortex \u2014and an anticorrelated Executive Control Network (ECN)\u2014including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices.

However, these confirmatory studies have generally not shown a downregulated insula-ECN connection.

As predicted by the tripartite model of nicotine addiction, divergent connections between insula subdivisions and both DMN and ECN are observed during abstinence. However, contrary to the model, it is not that right insula directly modulates the exchange of an exogenous orientation during satiety for an endogenous orientation during abstinence. Instead, the current data show that only those insula-seeded connections related to endogenous processing are modulated as a function of abstinence. These modulated insular circuits appear to facilitate the communication of subjectively aversive interoceptive signals during abstinence. As such, the identified circuits likely play a primary role in instantiating the aversive affective state characteristic of withdrawal. The significant correlations between a subset of these plastic, insula-seeded circuits and subjective ratings of withdrawal\u2014but importantly not cognitive performance\u2014are consistent with this interpretation and suggest a role for the identified circuits in processes that promote continued substance abuse via negative reinforcement.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21328, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "During abstinence, positive correlations seen in satiety were both selectively enhanced (i.e. POS-dACC and POS-IFC) and reduced (VEN-dlPFC), while negative correlations were only enhanced (DOR-IPL).

These d-rsFC findings are notable, as prior evidence in healthy participants identified insular nodes among the most flexible and interconnected within the human brain, with this flexibility related to executive function. Thus, the reduced flexibility observed, while not related to cognitive performance in our sample, is nonetheless maladaptive. Decreased d-rsFC is directionally consistent with the observation that chronically taxed biological systems display a lack of dynamic response to acute stress. The acute stress of nicotine abstinence precipitates both an overall reduction in d-rsFC as well as modulation of a diverse set of insular circuits, suggesting reduced d-rsFC may be an overarching signal of maladaptive circuit response to abstinence.
