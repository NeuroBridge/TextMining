Resting-state dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has been widely studied during recent years, and the emerging aberrant dFC patterns have been identified as important features of many mental disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ). However, only focusing on the time-varying patterns in FC is not enough, since the local neural activity itself (in contrast to the inter-connectivity) is also found to be highly fluctuating from research using high-temporal-resolution imaging techniques. Exploring the time-varying patterns in brain activity and their relationships with time-varying brain connectivity is important for advancing our understanding of the co-evolutionary property of brain network and the underlying mechanism of brain dynamics. In this study, we introduced a framework for characterizing time-varying brain activity and exploring its associations with time-varying brain connectivity, and applied this framework to a resting-state fMRI dataset including 151 SZ patients and 163 age- and gender matched healthy controls (HCs). In this framework, 48 brain regions were first identified as intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) using group independent component analysis (GICA). A sliding window approach was then adopted for the estimation of dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF) and dFC, which were used to measure time-varying brain activity and time-varying brain connectivity respectively. The dALFF was further clustered into six reoccurring states by the k-means clustering method and the group difference in occurrences of dALFF states was explored. Lastly, correlation coefficients between dALFF and dFC were calculated and the group difference in these dALFF-dFC correlations was explored. Our results suggested that 1) ALFF of brain regions was highly fluctuating during the resting-state and such dynamic patterns are altered in SZ, 2) dALFF and dFC were correlated in time and their correlations are altered in SZ. The overall results support and expand prior work on abnormalities of brain activity, static FC (sFC) and dFC in SZ, and provide new evidence on aberrant time-varying brain activity and its associations with brain connectivity in SZ, which might underscore the disrupted brain cognitive functions in this mental disorder.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2556, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe, chronic brain disorder whose symptoms can include delusions, disorganized thinking, hallucinations and social withdrawal. The disruptions of variety of cognitive and emotional domains, such as attention, emotion, and memory are often observed in patients with SZ. Aberrant brain activity and FC in SZ are important neural signatures of this disorder, such as reduced amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in cuneus and dysconnectivity between thalamus and sensory regions. Increasing numbers of studies have focused on the abnormal patterns of dFC in SZ during recent years, which have revealed information not available in static FC (sFC). By clustering the dFC into five reoccurring dFC state, Damaraju and his colleagues found that SZ patients spent less time in states with strong FC. They also identified significant group difference in FC within sensory networks and in FC between thalamus and sensory networks in several dFC states. Similar dFC state analysis was applied on SZ and bipolar disorder dataset for investigating state-based FC difference. Group differences between SZ patients and bipolar patients were found in patterns of FC involving the frontal and frontal-parietal regions at certain states. Dynamic FC features were also used for multi-classes classification. A recent study used the dFC states for the classification of SZ patients and bipolar patients and showed that the dFC features could improve the classification performance over the static FC features. Brain graph properties were explored at the dynamic perspective as well and significant SZ related alteration of dynamic brain graph has been reported.

To verify this hypothesis, we proposed a framework for assessing the time-varying local BOLD activity (measured by dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, dALFF) and investigating the associations between time-varying BOLD activity and time-varying brain connectivity (measured by correlation coefficient between dALFF and dFC). This framework was then applied to healthy controls (HCs) and SZ patients for the exploration of aberrant patterns in SZ. In this framework, spatial group independent component analysis (GICA) was first conducted to decompose the whole brain fMRI data into multiple functionally homogeneous regions. Secondly, a sliding window approach was adopted to estimate dALFF of brain regions and dFC between brain regions. Further, a k-means clustering method was used to identify patterns of dALFF that reoccur in time and across subjects. Finally, a dALFF-dFC correlation analysis was performed to investigate the associations between dALFF and dFC along time. The results showed that during the resting-state with eyes closed, BOLD activity comprises highly replicable dALFF states in a conceptual analogy to EEG microstates. HCs and SZ patients have significantly different occurrences of dALFF states. FC estimated at different dALFF states also differ, and such differences are coupled with alterations in ALFF. The dALFF and dFC are significantly correlated in time and, importantly, their associations are altered in SZ. Compared with HCs, SZ patients show lower or lost associations between dALFF of several important brain regions (such as thalamus and cuneus) and some dFC.

Kiviniemi and colleagues showed that the neural activation in the visual cortex was related to ALFF around 0.034 Hz, which suggested ALFF to be a representation of regional spontaneous neuronal activity. ALFF is also found to be different among resting-state brain networks and be altered by mental diseases, such as SZ and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, previous studies assumed ALFF is static throughout the entire scan, but ALFF is indeed time-varying because individuals are likely to engage in different mental processes which are associated with ALFF. It is important to investigate the temporal properties of abnormal local brain activity in patients\u2019 brain. In this study, by using a sliding window approach and a k-means clustering, 6 reoccurring states with different ALFF patterns were identified in time. We found that both normal people and patients had reoccurring ALFF patterns during the resting-state. These reoccurring ALFF patterns were denoted as \u201cdALFF states\u201d in a conceptual analogy to the microstate of EEG. EEG microstates describe the short periods during which scalp topography remain relative stable. We speculate that fMRI dALFF states and EEG microstates might capture similar physiological phenomena, although they persist for significantly different time-scale. Indeed, a previous study demonstrated that the EEG microstates time series showed dependencies over long time ranges and reveal scale-free, self-similar dynamics. It is also widely reported that the fluctuations of EEG power are correlated with BOLD signal activity during the resting-state. A recent simultaneous EEG and fMRI study found that a dynamic state with strong thalamocortical anticorrelations is associated with reduced EEG spectral alpha power and increased delta and theta power. In our study, FC patterns were found to be significantly different among dALFF states. Previous research suggested that changes of fMRI FC might reflect changes in neuronal synchrony, which may be driven largely by shifts in cognitive or vigilance states. Thus it is possible that the dALFF states with different FC patterns are associated with the EEG microstates and represent the condition of neural assemblies that support different cognitive processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30983, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although both normal people and patients have all these dALFF states during the resting-state, but the state occurrences were significantly different between groups.

Previous studies focusing on the frequency power of resting-state BOLD signals showed that, SZ patients have smaller power of low-frequency fluctuations and larger power of high frequency fluctuations during the resting-state. The underlying mechanism of such phenomenon is still unknown. Previous studies focusing on the brain activity in SZ usually assumed that brain activity patterns are constant in time and they speculated that such overall hypo-activity in SZ might be caused by the consistently lower low-frequency fluctuations in patients. However, our results provided evidence that the overall decreased low-frequency fluctuations in SZ are not caused by the consistently decreased low-frequency fluctuations during the entire scan, but due to that patients would spend more time in low ALFF states and less time in high ALFF states. Patients with SZ could also have high ALFF states as the HC did.

Hyperconnectivity between thalamus and sensory networks and hypoconnectivity within sensory networks have been widely reported in SZ. In our study, we found that in state 2 and state 4, FC between thalamus and sensory networks is larger and FC within sensory networks is smaller, than FC in other states.

Moreover, significant associations between dALFF of ICN and dFC between ICNs were identified in both HCs and SZ patients. These findings suggest that resting-state brain functional network might be an adaptive network, in which the changes of brain activity are linked to the changes of brain connectivity. These results might also be supported by a previous study showing that the variation of the topology depends on the variations of the local regions in neural networks. An interesting observation in dALFF-dFC correlation is that dALFF of one ICN is not only correlated with its dFC to other ICNs, but also correlated with dFC between other ICNs. For example, thalamus\u2019 dALFF is positively correlated with the dFC between regions within sensory networks.

Most of the dALFF-dFC correlations with group difference are caused by the loss of dALFF-dFC correlations in SZ group. These findings might imply a disruption of the adaptive network property in brain with this disorder. By using graph theory based analysis, previous studies also identified consistently disrupted brain network properties or altered dynamics of brain network properties in patients with SZ. A dALFF-dFC correlation between dALFF of cuneus and cuneus dFC to lingual gyrus was further found to be significantly negatively correlated with the score of working memory.

The window size of 40 s was selected as a reasonable choice for estimating FC dynamics, because previous studies, including our own, have shown that changes of FC are not particularly sensitive to a window size in the range of 20s to 1 min. However, since our current work is also focusing on dALFF, it is not clear whether such window size would be optimal for capturing the dynamics of brain activity. We have tested the reliability of the analysis using different window sizes. The dALFF and dFC were estimated with the window size from 16 TRs to 24 TRs. Consistent with previous studies on dFC, shorter window results in higher variability in dynamic patterns while larger window over smoothes the estimates. We also repeated the association analysis on dALFF and dFC obtained by sliding window approaches with 16 TRs and 24 TRs, and the overall results are similar. Therefore, we assume that 20 TRs window size could provide a good trade-off between the ability to resolve brain dynamics. Previous studies also raised the question that typical resting-state acquisition parameters might not be optimized for the exploration of dynamic patterns of FC and activity. It is still an open question how the scan length influences the dynamic analysis of connectivity and activities. Most of the dynamic studies still used the dataset with typical acquisition parameters and identified valuable dynamic patterns in both FC and brain activity. For example, Liu and Duyn used a dataset from 1000 Functional Connectomes Project with only 123 time points and successfully identified highly re-occurring co-activation patterns of brain activity. Rashid and her colleagues applied dFC clustering analysis on a dataset with the scan length of 5 min 15 s and found valuable biomarkers in dFC for the classification of SZ and bipolar patients. Our current used dataset has already been used in a previous dFC study and atypical dFC patterns in SZ have been identified.
