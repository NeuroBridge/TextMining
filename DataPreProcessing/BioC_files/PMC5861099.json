Variability in the expression of dynamic brain states links to cognition, learning, and the presence of psychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia that are characterized by a breakdown in cortical information processing.

Transient quasi-stable patterns detected in EEGs (microstates), for example, spatially correlate with network patterns observed through intrinsic functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging. Although macro-scale network dynamics have been linked with changes in arousal, attention, and autonomic activity, the biological bases and behavioral significance of these spontaneous fluctuations remain unresolved. There are at least two reasons for this lack of consensus. First, prior studies of functional network dynamics have largely focused on single clustering solutions in isolation, choosing a fixed number of temporal states a priori. As a result, a functional atlas of transient network configurations, or brain states, that are present throughout the population has not been fully characterized. Second, analyses of transient network function have principally focused on establishing the existence of a general architecture of dynamic connectivity shared across the population. Static patterns of intrinsic connectivity are heritable and act as a trait-like fingerprint that can accurately identify specific people from a large group. There is a reason to believe that a substantial portion of the dynamic connectome may be unique to each individual.

By one view, impaired network connectivity in patient populations might be time-invariant, emerging through stable deficits in brain function. An alternate possibility is that aspects of the functional impairments observed in psychosis reflect transient abnormalities preferentially evident during the expression of particular network configurations. Converging evidence suggests that aberrant oscillatory activity may link to core symptoms of schizophrenia, including the presence of hallucinations. Patients with schizophrenia exhibit reduced dynamism, spending longer periods of time within single brain states and demonstrating a less-variable repertoire of dynamic network configurations. Relative to healthy populations, patients with schizophrenia dwell more in network configurations typified by reduced large-scale connectivity, while also showing muted cross-network negative correlations, for instance, between default and other networks.

First, we coupled a population atlas of large-scale cortical networks and a sliding-window approach (11 time points; width\u2009=\u200933\u2009s) to estimate time-varying connectivity profiles within resting-state scans from 1919 healthy young adults (Fig.\u00a01; see Methods for information on data acquisition and preparation). These data were collapsed across participants before we applied k-means clustering to estimate solutions yielding from 2 to 20 brain states. Note that the brain states defined through k-means clustering do not necessarily have sharp boundaries, cleanly separating them from other network configurations. Rather, k-means clustering identifies sets of time-varying network configurations with common features, grouping them into clusters that are more similar to each other than to configurations in other clusters. The associated groupings can vary across clustering solutions as their complexity increases, revealing intermediate network configurations between more geographically separated states. To estimate the viability of the resulting solutions, we analyzed the population-level consistency of each clustering algorithm.
