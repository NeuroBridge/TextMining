Within the PFC, working memory postulates a crucial role in the dorsolateral portion. Consistent with this line of evidence, a PET study showed that the left DLPFC mediates the manipulation of verbal working memory. Several fMRI studies reported that working memory tasks induced less activation after repetition of the task, even without obvious task performance change. One mechanism underlying this phenomenon is believed to be improved neural efficiency of task processing. Because the automated processing induced by repeating a working memory task results in a reduced demand on the working memory load, it also reduces the activity in the task-related brain areas such as left DLPFC. Combined with the evidence that working memory is engaged in the VFT, these lines of evidence suggest that our results\u2014that is, the attenuated activation around the left DLPFC without task performance change\u2014are due to an improved neural efficiency to manipulate the VFT. Nonetheless, some other possibilities cannot be excluded, which may potentially explain the decrease of the oxy-Hb found in our study, e.g., mediation of some cognitive process may be implemented only in the initial phase of task learning or over-activation amplified in the initial phase of task may be optimized during task repetition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13581, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A number of fMRI studies have shown that the left PFC is potently activated by the phonemic VFT, and a fMRI study reported that a phonemic VFT that contained switching of the designated syllables exhibited left PFC hypoactivation in depressed patients compared with controls.

Because the laterality change was found in the VFT with the switching of the designated syllables in these studies, Klumpp et al. hypothesized that VFTs that require more switching among phonemes may be more sensitive to left frontal lobe deficits than those with less switching. Our results support this hypothesis from the viewpoint of normal engagement of the left PFC in manipulating the VFT. Further, our results could guide further development of the current VFT to focus more on left PFC dysfunction. Namely, repetition of the m-VFT could provide a more sensitive examination of left PFC function in terms of the efficiency of neural processing, in addition to observations from the single m-VFT that is currently used in clinical psychiatry settings in Japan.
