Brain reactivity to drug-stimuli predicts relapse risk in nicotine and other substance use disorders in some studies. Activity in the default mode network (DMN) is affected by drug cues and other palatable cues, but its clinical significance is unclear. In this study, 143 individuals with nicotine use disorder (NUD) (male n=91, ages 18\u201355) received a functional MRI scan during a visual cue task during which they were presented with a series of smoking- or food-related video clips prior to randomization to treatment with varenicline (n=80) or placebo. Group independent components analysis was utilized to isolate the DMN, and temporal sorting was used to calculate the difference between the DMN BOLD signal during smoke versus food cues for each individual. Food cues were associated with greater deactivation compared to smoke cues in the DMN. Correcting for baseline smoking and other clinical variables which have been shown to be related to treatment outcome in previous work, a less positive Smoke-Food difference score predicted greater smoking at 6 and 12 weeks when both treatment groups were combined (p=0.005, beta=\u22120.766). An exploratory analysis of executive control (ECN) and salience networks demonstrated that a more positive Smoke-Food difference score for ECN predicted a more robust response to varenicline relative to placebo.

Specifically, a lower value for Smoke\u2013Food during the task predicted a greater likelihood of poor outcome during treatment, indicating that the more the deactivation of the DMN to the smoke cues approached that associated with the food cues, the worse outcome the individual was likely to have. DMN is active in self-referential processing and rumination, and deactivated during tasks that are attention grabbing and require executive control. We had expected that there would be greater deactivation in DMN to food cues compared to smoke cues, based on previous work. An explanation for this somewhat counter-intuitive but replicating finding is that, even in individuals with SUD, food cues are often still more palatable than drug cues (as demonstrated in previous work in AUD assessing palatability of alcohol versus food cues). The degree of deactivation to food cues could be understood to represent the general capacity of the DMN to deactivate to a palatable cue and may serve as a baseline that represents the maximum degree to which the cue can capture an individual\u2019s attention. Our outcome prediction findings could therefore indicate that individuals for whom the smoking cue has a greater ability to capture attention relative to the overall capacity of the DMN to deactivate (as represented by the response to food cue) are more vulnerable to relapse during treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25994, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another additional surprising finding was that the DMN\u2019s response to food cue was independently able to predict treatment outcome, such that a lower degree of DMN deactivation during food cues predicted a worse treatment outcome. Granted, this effect was not present in the supporting analyses which involved using only the available data, or the analyses comparing neuroimaging variable values between abstinent and non-abstinent individuals (Table 6,7,S1\u20133), and the effect of food cues in the primary analyses was smaller than that observed for the difference score. However, these findings could indicate that general DMN pathology is driving some of the Smoke-Food results, and that lower deactivation to food cue may be a biomarker of muted response to natural rewards. Relatedly, individuals with more severe levels of dependence may have muted responses to food cues due to effects of chronic smoking on neuropeptide levels regulating appetite.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26947, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The predictive effects of DMN on smoking outcome were observed after correcting for the effects of other clinical covariates which have been previously observed to predict outcomes during smoking cessation treatment. In this study, baseline number of cigarettes smoked, number of previous quit attempts, and, more weakly, self-reported dependence severity were predictors of outcome (in addition to medication group assignment, as expected), but the other clinical variables were not. These findings highlight the potential importance of using brain activation during drug cues to predict treatment outcomes as it may turn out to be a more sensitive or reliable marker of future clinical behavior. Indeed, in other work in NUD, greater insula activation to smoking cues was significantly predictive of worse outcome, observed with only 21 subjects (partial eta squared .27; large effect), and smokers who showed lower pre-quit levels of brain reactivity to pleasant stimuli than to cigarette-related cues were less likely to be abstinent 6 months after their quit attempt, observed with only 55 subjects (odds ratio of 6.34 at 24 weeks; medium to large effect).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28109, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The results from the exploratory analyses of ECN and SN were notable. For one, in line with our working model that food cues were more engaging than smoke cues, food cues were associated with greater (positive) engagement of both ECN (significant) and SN (non-significant) compared to smoke cues. Second, DMN was negatively correlated with SN, in line with previous work but, surprisingly, it was not negatively correlated with ECN. In the presence of appetitive cues, the relationships between ECN and DMN may be different than they are during cognitive tasks or at rest. Most importantly perhaps, there were significant interaction terms (Smoke-Food/Smoke/Food\u00d7RxGrp) when these networks were used as predictors. Exploring these interactions further indicated that some of these markers (more positive values in R ECN to Smoke-Food and to Smoke, more positive values in L ECN to Smoke-Food, and greater activation in SN to Food) might prove useful in treatment matching as they identify individuals more likely to respond to treatment with varenicline. Furthermore, more positive values of Smoke-Food for R ECN was associated with greater improvement in individuals on varenicline but not placebo. Previous work has shown that varenicline is associated with decreased activation to smoking cues in regions of the R ECN. In combination with our data, this might indicate that varenicline is working in this region in individuals with greater activation to Smoke and Smoke-Food by decreasing smoking cue-induced signal.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29629, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "That the food cues were associated with greater deactivation in DMN than the smoke cues (in fact the smoke cues alone resulted in almost no mean DMN deactivation) could indicate that food cues were more appetitive; unfortunately one limitation to our study is that we did not obtain ratings of palatability. However, even if this is true, this was not an especially striking limitation, given that the difference between these two cues was still able to predict clinical outcome. Although individuals with SUD are generally conceptualized to have increased sensitivity to drug rewards but lower sensitivity to natural rewards such as food, this is not always observed in NUD; other work has demonstrated that some individuals with NUD responded more to smoking cues relative to other pleasurable cues, and others less, and that these categories predicted smoking outcomes during NUD treatment. Both these results and our findings demonstrate that it is the relative strength of these cues that matters clinically in NUD. Furthermore, one could raise concerns about the validity of using food cues as a baseline, especially since an individual\u2019s hunger levels could affect the brain\u2019s response. For this reason, we included a measure of food craving [WSWS(food)] as a covariate in all relevant analyses, to control for this. Finally, in some cases, results differed between the full sample (outcomes imputed to baseline) and the smaller sample with complete data (DMN Food, Table 8); when results did not replicate in both samples we did not highlight them in the discussion. These differences may have been driven by differences between the populations (details in Supplemental Results).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31317, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, these findings indicating that DMN deactivation to smoke cues relative to food cues robustly predicted clinical outcome are novel and important. Notably, this is one of the first works in any SUD to directly investigate the pattern of DMN activity during the processing of palatable cues and to investigate the relationship between DMN deactivation to drug cue in relation to food cue as a marker of relapse vulnerability. Although brain activation to nicotine and other drug cues has been studied and documented and its clinical importance established in a variety of clinical populations, very little work has focused on the effects of drug and other reward cues on DMN activity and its clinical relevance. Future work should attempt to replicate these findings in other NUD treatment samples, as well as in other SUD, to identify whether or not this is a reliable method to predict overall treatment
