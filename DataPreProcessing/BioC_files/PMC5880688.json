However, the extent to which the altered brain structure and function possibly recover over time after cocaine abstinence remains less clear. The present study examines 39 male military veterans with different stages of cocaine addiction and long-term abstinence (from 1 year up to 30 years) and evaluates plausible changes in brain structure and function of specific brain regions that sub-serve addictions. These include the striatum that is involved in cocaine reward; the lateral prefrontal cortex (especially the dorsolateral PFC) that plays a major role in inhibitory control; the insula, which has been implicated in craving; and the medial orbitofrontal (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) shown to play key roles in foresight and decision-making. The results suggest that there are differences in both brain structure (gray matter volume, GMV) and function between cocaine USERS and CONTROLS, with USERS showing plausible relative strengthening in neural systems for processing reward and craving, and relative weakening in neural systems involved in inhibitory control and decision-making. Examination of possible neural changes after abstinence suggests that presumed recovery occurs mostly in neural systems related to reward, craving, and inhibitory control, but to a lesser extent in neural systems related to decision-making. Given the limitations of the data in terms of a small sample size, as well as the lack of certainty about occasional use in the abstinent group, these results may be considered as preliminary. However, they are compelling in that they suggest that male military veterans cocaine USERS are indefinitely at a higher risk for making lapses in judgment and decision-making leading to possible relapse, if reward salience and craving become more intense. Understanding the neurobiology of long-term cocaine abstinence in vulnerable populations and beyond could help devising better therapeutic strategies that prevent relapse.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2206, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2219, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cocaine is a powerful addictive drug that leads to numerous short-term and long-term health consequences.

With repeated use, it can cause long-term molecular biological changes in the reward system, which in turn will increase cocaine use and promote addiction. Moreover, compared with healthy controls, cocaine dependent individuals showed reduced glutamate metabolism in both reward system and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, a critical brain region for inhibitory control. Also, structural brain imaging demonstrated that repeated cocaine exposure changes regional gray matter and white matter in these brain systems. For example, reported that cocaine users had less GMV in the ventromedial orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, anteroventral insular, and superior temporal cortices. reported similar results, and showed that cocaine users had less GMV in the premotor cortex bilaterally, right orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral temporal cortex, left thalamus, and bilateral cerebellum, as well as lower right cerebellar white matter volume relative to a control group. They also observed an inverse correlation between duration of cocaine use, and the right and left cerebellar gray matter volumes. Lastly, using functional brain imaging, researchers have found altered brain activity and connectivity in these systems for cocaine users compared to controls. For example, found that cocaine use was associated with increased resting state functional connectivity in striatal-frontal circuits; and with decreased resting state functional connectivity between the striatum and cingulate, striatal, temporal, hippocampal/amygdala, and insular regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5441, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although these studies have reported that cocaine use was associated with changes in brain structure and function in key neural regions linked to addictive behaviors, little is known about possible corrective functional and structural alterations that take place in the brain during recovery, especially over long abstinence periods.

Our analysis focuses on the abovementioned four neural regions, as these are important for addiction development and maintenance, and alterations in them are often associated with cocaine use. Prior research specifically showed that the striatum tends to be more efficient (often manifested through reduced gray matter volume) in cases of addiction; the insular cortex tends to be hypo-active in cases of addiction (often manifested through reduced gray matter volume), but the findings regarding the insula are mixed, as lesions to it actually disturb addiction; and that the frontal regions we focus on (dorsolateral PFC, medial OFC and VMPFC) tend to be hypo-active in cases of addiction (often manifested through reduced gray matter volume). Assuming that neural recovery involves corrective actions related to these regions, and given their proven flexible morphology, we hypothesize that abstinence will be associated with opposite changes, both in brain function and structure. We further conjecture that these changes will likely be more pronounced in subcortical regions, as these are more prone to morphological adaptations compared with prefrontal regions.

The first analysis focused on group differences between 1) USERS and CONTROLS, 2) USERS and ABSTINENCE, 3) ABSTINENCE and CONTROLS. Since the number of participants in the CONTROL group was relatively small, we first examined group difference between three groups as a means to preliminarily search for brain regions that may present differences. These differences were further refined by dividing the ABSTINENCE group into three subgroups: ABS1 (1\u20135 years of abstinence, n = 5), ABS2 (6\u201310 years of abstinence, n = 5), and ABS3 (abstinent for over 10 years, n = 10).

It specifically examined how cocaine use or abstinence duration may be associated with differences in four brain regions that are instrumental in addiction formation and maintenance. The findings point to both GMV and functional activation differences in USERS compared to CONTROLS in all of these target regions, namely the striatum; the lateral prefrontal cortex (especially the dorsolateral PFC); the insula; and the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Specifically, USERS showed presumed unhealthy strengthening of neural systems for processing reward and craving (higher GMV and higher activation in the right striatum and left insula), and relative weakening of neural systems involved in (1) inhibitory control (the right lateral frontal pole [LFP] showed lower GMV, but interestingly higher functional activation, which may reflect more effortful engagement due to structural deficits), and (2) decision-making (the left OFC/VMPFC showed lower GMV and functional activation). Although compelling, the results are limited in that they include a relatively small sample size, as well as they lack methods that rule out with certainty any occasional use in the long-term cocaine abstinent group.

This is consistent with many observations that prefrontal deficit can be difficult to fix and that these brain regions are less prone to morphological changes compared to sub-cortical regions. Specifically, GMV and functional activation negatively correlated with years of abstinence from cocaine use in the ABSTINENCE group, in the right striatum and left insula. Moreover, in the ABSTINENCE group, GMV in the right LFP positively correlated with abstinence duration, while functional activation in the right LFP negatively correlated with years of abstinence. In contrast, both GMV and functional activation levels in the left OFC/VMPFC regions were not associated with years of abstinence. Additional analyses also suggested that USERS had reduced functional connectivity between the right striatum and the left insula, left VMPFC, and right LFP. While two of these connections (between the right LFP and the right striatum, and between the left insula and the right striatum) correlated with years of abstinence, the connection between left VMPFC and right striatum did not correlate with abstinence duration. This endorses the idea that after cocaine abstinence, it is possible that at least some neural systems related to reward, craving, and inhibitory control adapt; and their recovery is a function of time. The required recovery time, though, is long (several years). However, neural systems related to foresight and decision-making may not show similar recovery patterns. This implies that cocaine USERS may be indefinitely at a higher risk for making lapses in judgment and decision-making, and that these may be one reason for their ongoing relapses, especially if reward salience and craving become more intense. Hence, therapies that target decision making improvement, for example through mindfulness training, may be useful for improving abstinence rates; only under the assumption that USERS have the capacity to exert the needed inhibition. If the inhibition facilities do not recover, strategies to reduce cue salience (e.g., avoiding cues related to Cocaine) may be more efficacious.

The striatal GMV increase was consistent with Ersche and colleagues who found similar increase in GMV of the striatum. Also, animal studies showed that cocaine use increases dopamine receptors and mRNA in the striatum, which may explain the observed increase in GMV. Some studies also point to higher GMV in the left insula of smokers, compared to controls. Moreover, it has been shown that the GMV of the insular cortex of cocaine addicts is associated with abstinence duration. A recent study suggested that there may be sex related differences regarding GMV and addiction, which may partially explain the inconsistency with earlier work that was observed in our study (our study only examined male participants).

This is consistent with previous studies using the cue task paradigm. Similarly, in cocaine addicts the striatal system is often hyperactive, whereas the OFC is typically hypoactive during the performance of a Stroop task.

These results support our hypotheses that cortical neural systems sub-serving decision-making may not recover as effectively as sub-cortical regions, even after long-term cocaine abstinence. These findings are consistent with several prior studies. While recovery of neuropsychological functions are expected after a long period of abstinence (e.g.,, the persistence of decision-making impairments has been intriguing. For example, it has been shown that alcoholics can achieve long-term abstinence in spite of persistent deficits in decision making as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task. These findings are consistent with the proposal that decision-making deficits and non-recovering VMPFC reflect a vulnerability or predisposing factor to substance use disorders that may persist with abstinence.

Using arterial spin labeling and resting state fMRI, enhanced regional cerebral blood flow in the left posterior hippocampus in a relapsed group, as compared to early remission and control groups was revealed; using this posterior hippocampus as a seed, increased resting state functional connectivity strength with the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus in relapsed versus early remission subgroups was also observed.

To a normal individual, cocaine cues may evoke many negative emotional responses that are implicit, and not necessarily conscious. The PFC is a key brain region involved in the processing of emotionally competent stimuli, and patients with lesions in the PFC do not trigger, for example, skin conductance responses to IAPS pictures, including pictures of drug paraphernalia. On the other hand, cocaine addicts are suspected to have a deficiency in this same PFC region.

The results are fairly consistent with prior research and point not only to similarities and possible shared neural underpinning of addictions to various substances and behaviors, but also to similarities in terms of possible recovery during abstinence. There are several noteworthy limitations in this study. First, the sample size is relatively small and the participants are all male veterans in their mid-50s. Although we had a large cohort of participants for behavior screening, the relatively strict exclusion criteria, other co-morbidities, the time scope of the study, and body condition disqualified many of them from being scanned, thus reducing the sample size. Essentially, we focused on long term abstinence in an existing cohort and this has reduced the likelihood of meeting our criteria and agreeing again (after many years) to take part in our study. Second, although our previous studies have demonstrated the reliability and validity of the timeline follow back procedure combined with urine testing, it might be possible that the length of cocaine abstinence measure was biased. Future research may benefit from including a more rigorous biomarker or secondary measure (e.g. caretaker report), in order to strengthen assertions regarding abstinence duration. Third, the functional connectivity analysis only focused on the brain regions showing significant activation in the cue task, but not the whole brain. Fourth, this is a cross-sectional and correlational study, which limits causality arguments. Longitudinal studies should be conducted in the future to replicate and extend the findings from this study. Despite these limitations, these results are compelling in that they suggest that male military veterans cocaine USERS are indefinitely at a higher risk for making lapses in judgment and decision-making leading to possible relapse, if reward salience and craving become more intense.
