Most previous studies investigating resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) have relied on a priori restrictions on seed regions or specific networks, which may bias observations. In this study, we aimed to elicit the connectivity alterations of the cerebellum in schizophrenia in a hypothesis-free approach. Ninety-five schizophrenia patients and 93 sex- and age-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A voxel-wise data-driven method, resting-state functional connectivity density (rsFCD), was used to investigate cerebellar connectivity changes in schizophrenia patients. Regions with altered rsFCD were chosen as seeds to perform seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses. We found that schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased rsFCD in the right hemispheric VI; moreover, this cerebellar region showed increased rsFC with the prefrontal cortex and subcortical nuclei and decreased rsFC with the visual cortex and sensorimotor cortex. In addition, some rsFC changes were associated with positive symptoms.

The involvement of the cerebellum in these functions may be related to its connection to several functionally heterogeneous cortical and subcortical regions through a cerebellar-subcortical-cortical loop. Until now, the converging lines of evidence point toward structural and functional abnormalities of the cerebellum in schizophrenia (Andreasen and Pierson; Lungu et al.; Picard et al.). For example, schizophrenia patients have exhibited altered cerebellar gray and white matter volume (Kuhn et al.; Laidi et al.; Lee et al.), abnormal task-related activation of the cerebellum (Bernard and Mittal), and cerebellar functional and anatomical connectivity abnormalities (Collin et al.; Liu et al.; Wang et al.).

First, most of our patients had chronic schizophrenia and were receiving antipsychotic medications.

In the present study, we used multiple thresholds (R\u00a0=\u00a00.4, 0.6 and 0.8) to compute the rsFCD and found that our main results were reproducible after considering the effects of different correlation thresholds. Third, because we were limited at that time by the lack of an ideal Chinese version cognition assessment tool specific to schizophrenia patients, such as the Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) or the Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) (Wu et al.; Shi et al.; S\u00e1nchez-Torres et al.), we did not assess the schizophrenia patients\u2019 cognition abilities and we did not investigate the relationship between rsFCD or rsFC alterations in the cerebellum in schizophrenia and cognition ability. We plan to explore it in a future study. Fourth, the lifetime antipsychotic dosage is more meaningful than the daily dosage to investigate the brain function activity alterations in schizophrenia patients, and we must collect the lifetime antipsychotic dosage information to analyze the influence of the antipsychotics to the functional activity of the brain. However, because many patients in the clinical setting cannot accurately recall their lifetime antipsychotic dosage because they had taken several antipsychotics in the past years, we could not collect their lifetime antipsychotic dosage in this study. We only recorded the daily antipsychotic dosage at the time of MRI scanning. We must consider the effect of the lifetime antipsychotic dosage in the future work to obtain more useful information regarding the mechanism of schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21847, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, although some limitations exist, we revealed a disrupted functional connectivity pattern in the cerebellum in schizophrenia by the combination of rsFCD and rsFC methods.
