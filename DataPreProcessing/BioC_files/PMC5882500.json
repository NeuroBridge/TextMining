BESA employs a least squares fitting algorithm, over which the user has interactive control. Source localization proceeds by a search within the head model for a location where the sources can explain a maximal amount of variance. Here, we assumed bilateral symmetrical sources. An assumption of spatial symmetry considerably reduces the number of independent parameters to be determined and is consistent with the known generators of P1. The inverse leadfield matrix (i.e., the matrix of coefficients that maps current sources to surface potentials) was then used to project the modeled dipolar activity back onto the scalp surface in order to select the optimal channels used for the ERP analysis of the P1 component. Source modeling resulted in dipoles localized to generators in dorsal extrastriate cortex of the middle occipital gyrus consistent with previous studies. The model produced a goodness-of-fit value of 96.4% (residual variance = 3.6%) across the modeled epoch of 80 \u2013 116 ms (see Figure 7 a,b). Based on the distribution of the dipolar surface projection, we chose to measure P1 from the average of six electrodes from each hemisphere: TP7/8, CP5/6, CP3/4, P7/8, P5/6, and P3/4, generating one analysis region of interest (ROI) on each hemisphere (see Figure 7c). We measured P1 separately for each ROI, using the largest positive peak appearing in the time window of 60 to 195 ms.
