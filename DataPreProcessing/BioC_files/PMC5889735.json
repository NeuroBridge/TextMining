The amygdala and its cortical targets decrease activity during a variety of task challenges in individuals engaged in problem drinking. On the other hand, it is less clear how amygdala resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) may be altered in association with alcohol misuse and whether such changes are restricted to prefrontal cortical structures. Further, the influences of comorbid substance use and depression and potential sex differences have not been assessed in earlier work. Here, with fMRI data from a Nathan Kline Institute/Rockland sample of 83 non-dependent alcohol drinkers (26 men), we addressed changes in whole brain rsFC of the amygdala in association with problem drinking as indexed by an alcohol involvement score. Imaging data were processed with Statistical Parametric Mapping following standard routines and all results were examined at voxel p<0.001 uncorrected in combination with cluster p<0.05 corrected for false discovery rate. Alcohol misuse was correlated with decreased amygdala connectivity with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) irrespective of depression and other substance use. Changes in amygdala-dACC connectivity manifested in the latero-basal subdivision of the amygdala. Further, men as compared to women showed a significantly stronger relationship in decreased amygdala-dACC connectivity and problem drinking, although it should be noted that men also showed a trend toward higher alcohol involvement score than women.

In decision making tasks involving surprising faces, the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) increased and amygdala decreased activation when the surprise was seen as a benefit or gain, and vice versa when the surprise was interpreted negatively as a threat or loss.

Although less of a focus for studies of the etiology of alcohol use disorders, alcohol affects amygdala and prefrontal circuit activities. Alcohol enhances the activities of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, and dampens PFC functions in emotional and cognitive processing. Acute administration of alcohol in healthy adults resulted in decreased amygdala activation during exposure to threatening facial expressions. A common precipitator of drinking, stress triggers the release of corticotropin-releasing factor via the amygdala hypothalamus circuit, resulting in increased anxiety that can be alleviated by alcohol consumption. Compared to non-drinking controls, alcoholic patients showed lower amygdala activation during a facial recognition task. Children with a family history of alcoholism showed decreased amygdala activation when they identified negative facial emotions. Social drinkers showed reduced amygdala activity to a risk-taking motor response and to fearful and angry faces after drinking. Compared to healthy controls, patients with alcohol dependence showed decreased amygdala PFC functional connectivity during a Trier social stress task. Acute alcohol as compared to placebo administration decreased right amygdala PFC connectivity in heavy social drinkers viewing angry faces. Weaker functional connectivity between the amygdala and superior frontal gyrus was reported in children with a family history of alcoholism viewing emotional stimuli as well as in alcoholic patients performing an emotional face recognition task and an inhibition task.

The reduced connectivity appeared to be specific to the right amygdala and the latero-basal subdivision. In addition, increased alcohol involvement influenced amygdala-ACC connectivity more strongly in men than in women, suggesting a potential sex difference. These findings support previous reports of the effects of alcohol misuse on amygdala-prefrontal circuit and identify the latero-basal amygdala as a key subregion to mediate these influences.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25631, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25654, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
