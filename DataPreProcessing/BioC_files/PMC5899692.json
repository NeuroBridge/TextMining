Only a minority of CHR individuals convert to full-blown psychosis. Therefore, there is a strong interest in identifying neurobiological abnormalities underlying the psychosis risk syndrome. Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) captures time-varying connectivity over short time scales, and has the potential to reveal complex brain functional organization. Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 70 healthy controls (HCs), 53 CHR individuals, and 58 early illness schizophrenia (ESZ) patients, we applied a novel group information guided ICA (GIG-ICA) to estimate inherent connectivity states from DFC, and then investigated group differences. We found that ESZ patients showed more aberrant connectivities and greater alterations than CHR individuals. Results also suggested that disease-related connectivity states occurred in CHR and ESZ groups. Regarding the dominant state with the highest contribution to dynamic connectivity, ESZ patients exhibited greater impairments than CHR individuals primarily in the cerebellum, frontal cortex, thalamus and temporal cortex, while CHR and ESZ populations shared common aberrances mainly in the supplementary motor area, parahippocampal gyrus and postcentral cortex. CHR-specific changes were also found in the connections between the superior frontal gyrus and calcarine cortex in the dominant state.

Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI reflects the functionally integrated relationship between spatially separated brain regions, and may provide biomarkers for mental disorders. Most previous FC studies including CHR individuals have investigated networks seeded from a priori defined regions of interest (ROIs) (e.g., thalamus, superior temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum) by computing connectivity between a specific ROI and other voxels in whole brain. To our knowledge, no prior work has investigated whole-brain pair-wise FCs in CHR individuals using resting-state fMRI data. Moreover, the above mentioned research employed static FC (SFC) analyses, which assume that FC is unchanging across the scan acquisition period. However, recent studies have provided evidence that FC can be time-varying over periods of tens of seconds, evident during a few minutes of scans.

(1) We lack sufficient clinical follow-up of CHR individuals to permit evaluation of whether DFC abnormalities predict conversion to psychosis. However, our framework can be potentially applied for individual-subject classification (or prediction) in future work where the clinical follow-up data of CHR subjects are available. One possible strategy is to use features from the dominant state that shows a comparable pattern across subjects. Based on the altered connectivities in the dominant connectivity state, a classifier/model can be built using converted and unconverted CHR subjects\u2019 data. Then, for a new/testing CHR subject, the related dominant subject-specific connectivity state can be computed from the individual-subject\u2019s dynamic connectivity patterns. Finally, the new CHR subject with features from its dominant state can be classified by the well-trained model. The other alternative strategy is to employ all states, similar to the previous work from our group. In this strategy, two groups of the group-level connectivity states (including all the dominant and non-dominant states) from both converted CHR group and unconverted CHR group can be used as the common regressors. By representing each window-related connectivity matrix as a linear combination of the common regressors and then averaging the beta-values across all windows, each subject will have same number of features. So, these features can be used to train a classifier based on the training subjects and yield the classification labels for testing subjects. We will investigate this issue in the future when more data are available. (2) The fMRI data used in our study was relatively short (i.e., six minutes). Some work used data from a longer scanning to investigate dynamics; however, many studies have already shown that different connectivity states can be robustly and replicably captured in a similarly short period such as five minutes. (3) The number of ICs in the framework was adjustable, and a change in this parameter may influence the states and the identified biomarkers. We selected the number of ICs according to previous work, which preserved enough variance from each subject\u2019s DFC and resulted in reliable GSs under multiple ICA runs. However, other settings may deserve study. (4) We used the canonical AAL template-defined ROIs to compute the whole-brain FC, as the template provides clear parcellation and explicit description on whole-brain regions. In the future, we will also consider using ROIs obtained from ICA, clustering techniques, and previous fMRI studies. (5) In light of the relatively small sample sizes available for this study, we included CHR individuals who were treated with antipsychotic medication at the time of testing. Given that only a minority of CHR individuals were taking antipsychotic medication, this was unlikely to confound our results. Nonetheless, we also performed the same DFC analyses using the unmedicated CHR individuals to explore. Results in supplementary materials showed that the patterns remain consistent with the findings described above. In addition, data of CHR individuals with different syndromes were analyzed. Due to the unbalanced number in different syndrome-related groups, we cannot investigate if CHR subjects with different syndromes have significant different brain connectivity. We plan to explore this issue when more data are available. (6) The association relationship (correlations) between connectivity strengths and symptom scores cannot pass correction for multiple comparisons probably due to the small sample size. So, the association results should be validated in future. (7) Similar to a previous functional connectivity study in CHR individuals, we regressed out the global mean signal when preprocessing, since global signal is assumed to reflect a combination of resting-state fluctuations, physiological noise (e.g. respiratory and cardiac noise), and other noise signals with non-neural origin. Regressing out global mean has been shown to facilitate the detection of localized neuronal signals and improve the specificity of functional connectivity analysis, although it could result in increased negative correlations. Considering that regressing out global mean is a controversial issue, we will investigate its impact in the future. (8) Since the non-dominant group-level states were not very corresponding across the three groups (as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Table 2), estimating and comparing the associated non-dominant subject-specific states should be carefully conducted. In fact, the non-dominant states may only be comparable between the CHR group and ESZ group, but not comparable between the HC group and CHR (or ESZ) group, due to that they may be disease-related.
