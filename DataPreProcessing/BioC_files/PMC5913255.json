Previously both state and trait magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of AVH have identified activity in brain regions involving auditory processing, language, memory and areas of default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). Current evidence is clouded by research mainly in participants on long-term medication, with chronic illness and by choice of seed regions made \u2018a priori\u2019. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the intrinsic functional connectivity in patients presenting with first episode psychosis (FEP). Resting state functional MRI data were available from 18 FEP patients, 9 of whom also experienced AVH of sufficient duration in the scanner and had symptom capture functional MRI (sc fMRI), together with 18 healthy controls. Symptom capture results were used to accurately identify specific brain regions active during AVH; including the superior temporal cortex, insula, precuneus, posterior cingulate and parahippocampal complex. Using these as seed regions, patients with FEP and AVH showed increased resting sb-FC between parts of the SN and the DMN and between the SN and the cerebellum, but reduced sb-FC between the claustrum and the insula, compared to healthy controls.It is possible that aberrant activity within the DMN and SN complex may be directly linked to impaired salience appraisal of internal activity and AVH generation. Furthermore, decreased intrinsic functional connectivity between the claustrum and the insula may lead to compensatory over activity in parts of the auditory network including areas involved in DMN, auditory processing, language and memory, potentially related to the complex and individual content of AVH when they occur.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1958, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1971, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are commonly linked to schizophrenia and occur in over 75% of the patients with First Episode Psychosis (FEP). Current biological models of AVH can be grouped into those based on abnormal brain activation, source-monitoring deficits, or errors in prediction, . The abnormal activation theory proposes that AVH arise from spontaneous activation in the primary auditory, superior temporal cortex and related memory areas. According to source monitoring accounts, AVH results from failure to accurately monitor one\u2019s own internal speech, which is then attributed to an external source. Prediction error models are based on the Bayesian framework that proposes positive symptoms of psychosis including hallucinations arise due to a mismatch between prior expectations and incoming sensory information, leading to a prediction error and voice perception. These models are not mutually exclusive and some commonality exists, for example prediction error can be implicated in source monitoring deficits. Study of brain activity during hallucination itself (symptom capture) allows direct evidence of regions active during hallucinations, and studies using this method show these regions include areas important for auditory perception (primary auditory cortex, and middle and superior temporal cortex), language (inferior frontal gyrus), and memory (hippocampus and parahippocampus). However, there remains a lack of detailed modelling that explains the spontaneous, complex and transient nature of AVH, and how the aberrant activity in these brain regions is triggered in the absence of an external stimuli. Thus the key question of how the brain generates AVH remains unanswered.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3683, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, theories of abnormal integration have been proposed to explain symptoms of schizophrenia, including delusions and hallucinations, with a central abnormality being aberrant activity in intrinsic brain networks such as the default mode network (DMN) or the salience network (SN). Northoff proposed that AVH may result from abnormally elevated resting state activity in auditory cortex or from the default-mode network, with a \u2018neural confusion\u2019 between auditory resting state stimulus-induced activity, while Jardri et al. proposed that hallucinations occur during spontaneous DMN withdrawal. Disordered connectivity has also been implicated in schizophrenia, with mechanism of aberrant SN co-ordination of DMN and other brain regions . Thus, there is growing evidence of aberrant DMN and SN activity in schizophrenia, and a failure of integration or altered connectivity within brain networks that may explain positive symptoms including delusions and hallucinations. However, additional evidence is needed to elucidate the relationship of this activity to hallucinations in particular. Previous investigations of AVH, predominantly in patients with schizophrenia and long standing illness, assessing functional connectivity (FC) have used a seed-based approach (sb-FC) based on the three hypotheses outlined above, with seed placement in brain areas responsible for auditory processing, language, and memory; the striatum, and in areas of DMN.

Our results of both the left insula seed shows connectivity with right insula and anterior cingulate cortex (key regions of SN). Together with literature from patients with chronic AVH, the suggestion may be that resting state dysconnectivity within the DMN and SN are implicated in the generation of AVH, which during the experience itself will further involve temporal and auditory networks. Reduction in left insula volume has been observed in patients with schizophrenia and prominent hallucinations and volumes of the left insula and right STG have been negatively correlated with severity of AVH in a meta-analysis of structural studies. Although with a small sample and cross sectional study it is speculative to propose definitive models, our results suggest that AVH possibly begin with dysconnectivity between the DMN and SN.

The claustrum has been reported to be activated specifically during AVH. The role of the claustrum includes sensory binding, modulation of selective attention, synchrony detection, and modulation and switching between intrinsic networks.

Our findings suggest a greater role for the insula in AVH which, along with anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum, has been shown to be an important brain region involved in prediction error coding. Aberrant predictive coding error could be a mechanism by which the SN dysfunction leads to AVH. Timing, sensory prediction and learning are involved in perceptual processes, are key functions of the cerebellum which may have aberrant FC in patients with AVH.

These include primarily the small sample size, particularly of participants included in the symptom capture analysis, however this is comparable with previous fMRI symptom capture studies in chronic schizophrenia, which number 1\u201318, and reflect the challenge of capturing AVH in real time . We have been cautious in interpretation of our results therein. In addition, not all of the participants experienced hallucinations during the symptom capture part of the study and thus it is possible that these participants had different brain regions active during their AVH that were not captured in our seed placement for sb-FC. Patients included in the symptom capture analysis had a cumulative median duration of AVH of 127\u2009s (out of 600\u2009s of scan time).

Notwithstanding, the results of the symptom capture have identified similar areas as the meta-analysis by Jardri et al. which provides some validity to the results from the symptom capture analysis and suggest the changes seen in chronic schizophrenia are also present early in the course of illness. Future studies should include a clinical control group of patients with psychosis who are not experiencing AVH to definitively establish the specificity of results to AVH rather than other group characteristics.
