Here, we examined whether the connectivity patterns of functional systems affected in schizophrenia (SCZ), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), or normal aging equally translate into high classification accuracies for these conditions. We compared classification performance between pre-defined networks for each group and, for any given network, between groups. Separate support vector machine classifications of 86 SCZ patients, 80 PD patients, and 95 older adults relative to their matched healthy/young controls, respectively, were performed on functional connectivity in 12 task-based, meta-analytically defined networks using 25 replications of a nested 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Classification performance of the various networks clearly differed between conditions, as those networks that best classified one disease were usually non-informative for the other. For SCZ, but not PD, emotion-processing, empathy, and cognitive action-control networks distinguished patients most accurately from controls. For PD, but not SCZ, networks subserving autobiographical or semantic memory, motor execution, and theory-of-mind cognition yielded the best classifications. In contrast, young\u2013old classification was excellent based on all networks and outperformed both clinical classifications. Our pattern-classification approach captured associations between clinical and developmental conditions and functional network integrity with a higher level of specificity than did previous whole-brain analyses.

While SCZ onset typically emerges during adolescence and early adulthood, PD is characterized by an onset during late adulthood and has been associated with premature aging, that is, earlier and more rapid neurodegeneration as compared to the course of normal aging. Both SCZ and PD are characterized by disease-specific pathophysiological changes of the dopaminergic system, contrasting with a more global dopamine decline in normal aging (NA). However, it has been proposed that dopaminergic dysfunction in SCZ arises as a secondary effect due to alterations of the glutaminergic system. In contrast, in PD dopaminergic deficiency represents the primary cause leading to pathophysiological upstream dysregulations of different neural systems. These neurobiological features of SCZ, PD and NA may manifest themselves in functional connectivity alterations at the level of large-scale brain networks. However, some putative commonalities (neurodegeneration, dopaminergic dysregulations, and altered connectivity) need to be juxtaposed with the prominent phenotypical differences between SCZ, PD, and NA and the fact that the clinical presentations of SCZ and PD are very different, raising the question whether various functional systems are differentially affected in the three conditions. Rather than assessing altered activations in different functional systems by conducting task-fMRI studies, we examined altered functional connectivity within various functional networks robustly defined by meta-analyses of task-based neuroimaging studies in a comparative fashion (cf.). This has the practicable advantage of using easily accessible, short and standardized resting-state data while at the same time incorporating the consolidated knowledge based on task-based imaging into the analysis. We argue that such an approach is particularly relevant given that in contrast to resting-state imaging, task-based assessments will rarely be feasible in a routine clinical setting.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4210, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Alterations in functional network integrity patterns in SCZ, PD or older adults (compared to respective healthy/young controls) can be captured by using machine learning-based classification. For extracting a diagnostically relevant marker that allows the classification of individual subjects based on the connectivity in functional brain networks, multivariate decoding algorithms like support vector machine (SVM) should provide the most appropriate approach for this endeavor. Rather than testing each connection independently for group differences, SVMs are trained on part of the data by weighting all connections in order to separate the known clinical status from healthy controls (HC). Classification accuracy can then be determined by assessing the ability to predict group membership of previously unseen subjects. Applied to (whole-brain) connectivity data, this approach has previously been found to distinguish SCZ patients (cf.) or PD patients (cf.) from healthy controls (HC), as well as aged from young subjects (NA) (cf.).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5251, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous pattern-classification studies aimed at providing the best possible classification performance on whole-brain connectivity. In contrast, the aim of the current work was to assess whether specific functionally defined networks are altered in SCZ, PD, and NA. While previous studies mainly used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based data-driven methods to extract major resting-state networks, our work is based on a priori meta-analytically defined networks associated with specific sets of behavioral functions such as working memory or emotional processing. In contrast to well-established resting-state networks, these networks represent the consolidated information from hundreds of task-based fMRI studies and hence those locations in the brain that are reliably activated when subjects perform tasks pertaining to a particular mental function. We thus argue that these nodes define robust functional networks in the brain related to specific mental domains. In turn, the functions associated with resting-state networks are usually derived from a reverse inference approach, as these lack any direct relationship to mental functions. We suggest that this more direct relationship between the network-nodes and actual task-demands is an important advantage of our approach. Moreover, the employed strategy results in an a priori, unbiased definition of the respective networks, whereas ICA-based networks are usually defined from the current data. Our meta-analytically derived network model approach thus offers the potential to investigate functional connectivity within robust a priori brain networks that are implicated in processing a specific mental process.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6934, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Therefore, the present study aimed to examine whether the known impairment of different functions in SCZ, PD, or aging, respectively, would equally translate into a high classification accuracy for a given network in the respective group, based on the connectivity pattern within this network. As a \u201cproof-of-principle\u201d approach we therefore intended to investigate whether various a priori networks based on task-activation findings carry differential disease-related information assessable by resting-state imaging. To this end, we examined two diseases which are clinically very disparate but well studied in the previous neuroimaging literature. The findings were then juxtaposed to findings on age-related effects in the same networks. Thereby, we could evaluate whether the respective networks carry differential information related to the different conditions or, conversely, whether the different networks carry differential information related to a particular condition. Given some putative commonalities and especially phenotypical differences, the aim was to examine the possibility for differential classification of SCZ, PD und age, rather than to primarily study the specific diseases and their clinical separation from each other or aging per se. In our investigation, these three groups thereby serve as examples to evaluate this approach. For example, we assume that connectivity in the reward network will be potent in differentiating SCZ patiens from matched HCs, as several studies have shown impairments related to reward learning in SCZ, and the neurobiology of this network has been linked to psychosis. Likewise, we would expect a good classification accuracy for PD patients based on FC in the motor network, given that motor impairments represent the core feature of this disease, and motor circuits in the brains of PD patients are altered during motor tasks and at rest. Finally, NA is accompanied by cognitive decline in various domains, such as deterioration in working-memory function.

Of note, we did not attempt between-patient classification (i.e., PD vs. SCZ), as the different groups were closely matched to their respective controls but substantially different from each other with respect to age, gender, and movement. The input variables (features) to the SVM consisted of edge-wise RSFC between all nodes of a given network. Each SVM was trained and tested by a nested 10-fold cross validation scheme for each individual group (see example Figure 1) (cf.). The inner loop used a 10-fold cross-validation within the training group to optimize the soft-margin slack parameter. For each fold of the outer loop, the left-out (unseen) 10% were then classified using the SVM trained on the (entire) training-set using the optimized parameter.

Classification performance was evaluated based on accuracy (Acc.), balanced accuracy (bAcc.), sensitivity (Sens.), and specificity (Spec.) as well as two measures derived from signal-detection theory: the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and d\u2019. Acc. denotes the overall proportion of subjects correctly classified as patients (PD, SCZ) or advanced age versus healthy or younger age, respectively.

In addition, RSFC variance attributable to these confounding factors or within-scanner movement were regressed out of the data before the SVM analyses. Therefore, these confounds were evidently heterogeneous across the three groups (SCZ, PD, NA) but should not have influenced classification accuracy within each condition. Although proper matching and state-of-the-art removal of variance related to motion (cf.), residual effects that only manifest in the multivariate pattern cannot be fully ruled out.

Still, our \u201csparse\u201d approach achieved classification accuracies comparable to those reported in previous whole-brain studies, whose feature space obviously was substantially larger than ours. This is particularly noteworthy given that two further aspects besides feature space could be expected to decrease classifier performance in our study: First, all of our three groups were based on relatively large samples that were combined from two different measurement sites and hence should be more heterogeneous than usual. Second, we used replicated 10-fold cross-validation, rather than the more optimistic leave-one-out approach.
