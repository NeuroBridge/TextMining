The hippocampal network is situated within a broader context of partially overlapping cortical networks (e.g. default mode, attention) that show varying degrees of disruption in schizophrenia. Observed modularity values for the hippocampal network were lower than those typically seen when modularity is optimized across multiple networks. The signals of nodes in a single network are expected to be comparatively similar, thus producing lower estimates of within-network modularity. The difference that persists between groups suggests the hippocampal network is less functionally integrated in patients relative to controls, an interpretation supported by follow-up descriptive analyses of functional connectivity values. Future studies are necessary to understand interactions between the hippocampal and cortical association networks and relative disruption of the hippocampal network compared with other networks in schizophrenia. Second, there are commonalities among schizophrenia patients that differentiate them from control subjects, including current and past use of psychoactive medications, stress, anxiety and mood alterations, and educational attainment. Thus, we cannot determine whether lower modularity in schizophrenia is due to a common neural phenotype or these other factors. Third, examining patients across early and later stages of illness could obscure differences in biology related to the progression of illness. Although modularity was similar across patients in our sample, longitudinal studies are necessary to make definitive statements about hippocampal network modularity over the course of schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29658, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The idea that the brain ceases to function as a set of cohesive, inter-related networks is among the most important and earliest theories linking neurobiology with the phenomenology of schizophrenia.

Matrices are thresholded at |r| \u2265 .5 to show only values included in modularity calculation. Schizophrenia patients showed a pattern of fewer positive and negative connections in the core hippocampal-MTLC network. In contrast, connectivity patterns in the broader hippocampal-cortical network were mixed; while schizophrenia patients had generally fewer positive connections than control subjects, patients also had a slightly greater number of strong negative connections than control subjects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39389, "infons": {"file": "nihms945434f3.jpg", "id": "F3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Correlations between modularity and relational memory ability are plotted for control subjects (blue) and schizophrenia patients (red). Shaded areas show the 95% confidence interval. (A) In control subjects, better relational memory was associated with lower modularity in the hippocampal-cortical network. These results were driven by a negative correlation between modularity and relational memory in the anterior hippocampal-cortical network. (B) In schizophrenia patients, better relational memory was associated with lower modularity of the hippocampal-MTLC network. The relationship was driven by a negative correlation between modularity and relational memory in the posterior hippocampal-MTLC network.
