Music intervention is used as a complementary treatment for improving symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. However, the neurophysiological correlates of these remissions remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of music intervention in neural circuits through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in schizophrenic subjects. Under the standard care, patients were randomly assigned to music and non-music interventions (MTSZ, UMTSZ) for 1 month. Resting-state fMRI were acquired over three time points (baseline, 1 month, and 6 months later) in patients and analyzed using functional connectivity strength (FCS) and seed-based functional connection (FC) approaches. At baseline, compared with healthy controls, decreased FCS in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) was observed in patients. However, after music intervention, the functional circuitry of the right MTG, which was related with the function of emotion and sensorimotor, was improved in MTSZ. Furthermore, the FC increments were significantly correlated with the improvement of symptoms, while vanishing 6 months later. Together, these findings provided evidence that music intervention might positively modulate the functional connectivity of MTG in patients with schizophrenia; such changes might be associated with the observed therapeutic effects of music intervention on neurocognitive function.

The prevailing neuroimaging studies indicated that the dysfunction of the brain functional network maybe associated with the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs are commonly used prolonged treatments for schizophrenia. In addition, the complementary therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and music intervention, are also choices for patients with schizophrenia.

The findings of music intervention open a new page for the study of the effect of music on humans. To investigate the effect of music intervention on schizophrenic subjects, research has compared patients receiving standard care with or without music intervention. Importantly, clinical reports have indicated that music intervention could have motivating, emotionally expressive, and relationship-building qualities in schizophrenia.

Importantly, our previous study indicated that the insular cortex might be an important region in music intervention from a local aspect (seed-based FC analysis) for schizophrenic subjects.

The distribution of high nodal connectivity in the brain plays vital roles in transferring information over the whole brain.

Several studies have demonstrated that the functional connectivity strength (FCS) metric, which could examine hub connectivity through voxel-based graph analysis approaches, is closely associated with physiological measures such as regional cerebral blood flow, oxygen, and glucose metabolism. Therefore, different from our previous work, in this study, fMRI was used to identify functional hubs of brain networks from the global aspect to assess the effect of music intervention on schizophrenia through computing the FCS at the voxel level. Such a voxel-wise approach enables whole brain hub mapping but overcomes the limitation of seed-based approaches for identifying and locating functional hubs in the brain. The goals of this study are to (1) explore the modulatory effect of music intervention on resting-state functional networks in patients with schizophrenia, (2) explore the relationship between music intervention-induced change of FC and change in psychiatric symptoms and neuropsychological in schizophrenia, and (3) assess the duration of effects of music intervention through studying the schizophrenic subjects six months later.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6642, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.

In schizophrenic subjects, perceptual deficits have become increasingly observed in the visual system. The early visual system is divided into two basic subdivisions, including parvocellular and magnocellular divisions. The magnocellular neurons are projected to the dorsal visual stream, such as the MTG and intraparietal sulcus, which process visual information and guide action. There are additional projections through the thalamus to subcortical regions, which may play a specific role in emotional expression. Previous excellent research reported that music could be associated with increased functional coupling between emotional and attentional brain regions in the parietal and visual regions (MTG) in patients with visual neglect. In this study, we observed the decreased FCS in the right MTG in schizophrenic subjects at the baseline, while we found music intervention could positively improve the abnormally lower FCS score of the right MTG. Our finding might be indicated that MTG may be a target gyrus in the dorsal visual stream for music intervention. Moreover, the altered FCS of MTG might positively regulate the processing of differentially sensitive motion to emotion in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25020, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The deficits of the visual magnocellular pathway appear to be related to higher level emotional and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Recent study also reported that the insular cortex and striatum are highly associated with visual magnocellular regions, which may serve as the neuroanatomical substrate in the perception of emotion. Through music intervention, we found increased FC between the right MTG and the right anterior insula which has been thought to have a role in tracking emotions. Increased functional integration between the MTG and insular cortex might have an improving effect on emotional processing in schizophrenic subjects. The abovementioned finding might reflect that the music intervention increased functional integration between the MTG and insula. The changed FC might improve higher order processes such as emotional identification and experience in MTSZ. In addition, the significant relationship was also observed between the changed FC of the insula and the change score of PANSS-total.

First, a single musical piece was selected (Mozart's sonata K.448) in the present study. The special effects of Mozart's music might be observed in patients. Further studies should investigate the effects of other types of music, such as general, familiar, and preferred music, in schizophrenic subjects. The future research might be a better way to understand the effect of different types of music on patients as well as to investigate whether these effects are similar to those obtained from Mozart music. Second, the correlation coefficient threshold, which is to eliminate weak correlations possibly arising from noise signal, is not unique during the FCS analysis, and this fixed value may lead to some false positive or negative findings. The threshold value of 0.2 was used in this study based on prior knowledge. We also performed the same processing using two other thresholds (i.e., 0.1 and 0.3); these results were similar.
