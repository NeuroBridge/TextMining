In constructing the ensemble of trees, random forest uses two levels of randomness: first each tree uses a bootstrapped version of the training data (bagging). Specifically, about 66% of the training data was used for each tree with replacement; the remaining training data was used to estimate error and variable importance. A second level of randomness is added at each node when growing a decision tree by randomly selecting a subset of variables to split. At each internal node, a best feature among a random subset of features is selected so as to maximize the reduction of label impurity, typically measured with the class entropy. The process is recursively repeated until the tree has either reached a predefined depth or the number of samples in a node falls below a threshold, or all the samples belong to the same class. The number of trees in the ensemble and the number of variables selected at each node are the two main parameters of the random forest algorithm. The random forest has been proven to achieve good performance with a different variety of datasets and has important advantages over other techniques in terms of its ability to handle highly non-linear biological data, robustness to noise, tuning simplicity (compared to other ensemble learning algorithms), and opportunity for efficient parallel processing. Classification of a new instance can be made by taking the majority vote from all the decision trees. It\u2019s often helpful to calculate relative importance or contribution of each feature in predicting the label. Random forest has several ways of constructing variable importance: 1) mean decrease impurity, i.e. average of the accumulated decrease in node impurity over all trees for each feature or 2) mean decrease accuracy, i.e. the decrease in accuracy on out-of-bag (OOB) samples by randomly permuting values for each feature. In this work we will use the first method to measure feature importance.

For example, several studies found decreased functional connectivity in AUD when compared with controls, such as DMN, ECN, SN and RN. On the other hand, several studies found increased functional connectivity in AUD, compared with controls. For example, patients with AUD also showed significant increased regional homogeneity in the posterior cingulate cortex, insula and reduction in the ACC, when compared with controls. Significant increased functional connectivity was found in DMN, ECN, SN, and attention network in AUD. Long-term abstinent alcoholic subjects showed increased functional connectivity in ECN. In our previous study, we found significant increased within-network FC in SN, DMN, orbitofrontal cortex (OFCN), left- ECN and amygdala-striatum (ASN) networks in AUD when compared with controls. These studies converge to support that the dysfunctional connectivity was associated with sustained alcohol use. However, even though group-level functional connectivity differences were found between AUD and controls, they may not be used as biomarkers to classify severity of the disease progress or ultimately predicting relevant future events, such as relapse. In the current study, adding to our previous findings, we found that two ECNs, and the RN have the strongest classification power in distinguishing AUD from controls (one ECN overlapped with the previous OFCN, the other ECN overlapped with the previous LECN, and the RN overlapped with the previous ASN). We observed that within-network FC measures offered maximal information for identifying alcoholism, suggesting that connectivity measures within the ECN and RN are particularly informative in detecting alcoholism. The classification performance improved with feature elimination suggesting that these few networks performed outstandingly among all other networks (87% accuracy and 90.5% precision). Also, the rank of the networks did not change when doing the LOOCV tests under different feature elimination cases suggesting that the contribution of the features was very stable and robust. Therefore, dysfunction of the ECN1 including OFC, MFG, the RN including the thalamus, accumbens, putamen, caudate, and the ECN2 involving MFG, FP, IFG and ACC may be part of the underlying neurobiology of addiction. On the other hand, the classification performance using between-network features only achieved 67.4% accuracy and 70.0% precision. This lack of robustness was also reflected in the fact that the rank of the network coupling also changed when doing the LOOCV tests under different feature elimination cases. These results suggested that the between-network coupling might only be a modest indicator to distinguish AUD from controls given the sample size we have. This may be due to the fact that we only used correlation to measure the weak dependency among network time courses.

In the future, this could be used for predicting and estimating the trajectory of AUD, such as identifying those at the first stage of addiction and are at risk of developing AUD, or ultimately predicting relapse and the treatment outcomes based on rs-FC phenotypes. In the future, these individual-level brain features can be integrated with task-based brain features, behavior measures, clinical measures, genetic and environmental factors using the multivariate approach to get a better understanding of cause and effect of AUD. For example, in a longitudinal study that identifies predictors of adolescent substance misuse, Whelan et al. 2014 not only showed the potential of neuroimaging as a tool to generate intermediate endophenotypes, but also highlighted the importance of combining neuroimaging with a wide range of potential causal factors including higher cognitive factors, personality, environmental factors, life experiences, genetics etc. to understand the mechanism underlying addiction. In this study, our results showed that with the help of machine-learning techniques we could deepen our understanding and better quantify the contribution of each brain networks to alcoholism.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27930, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitation", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27941, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several potential limitations in our study that should be taken into account carefully. First, clinical heterogeneity could have confounded results. Alcoholism is a highly comorbid disease, as in most cases it is coupled with current or past use of other drugs (such as cocaine, cannabis, or opioid etc.) and psychiatric comorbidities. However, since the subjects in the current study had different types of drug use or psychiatric disorders, it is unlikely that any particular one of the comorbidities might have contributed significantly to our results. Therefore, alcohol use disorder is still the dominant factor contributing to the functional connectivity difference between case and control. Second, the AUD and control groups were not age and gender matched. Consequently, we statistically controlled for age, in addition to gender, in our analysis. To ensure that the classification performance was not affected by these factors, another analysis was carried out in which we used age, gender, and brain-based features in an analysis, and found age and gender features did not change the performance of classification. Future research with case and control groups matched for age and gender would increase the reliability of the current results. Finally, for those participants with AUD having severe withdrawal symptoms during the first few days after stopping alcohol, benzodiazepines were given as needed as guided by the CIWA-Ar and vital signs monitoring. Although the fMRI session was conducted following hospitalization for at least 1 week (7 to 43 days), the benzodiazepines may still have had effects on the functional connectivity of the brain. Further tests are needed in this regard. Other limitations include using relatively short resting-state scan time (5 mins). Our data warrant replication in larger samples with longer scan time.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29807, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, within-network functional connectivity offered maximal information for predicting AUD status. Further, our results suggest that connectivity within the ECN and RN might be informative in predicting AUD. Further development of this approach might also provide useful information for therapeutic interventions or treatment effectiveness. More attention should be given to the patterns of information transmission and processing between these networks in AUD and perhaps other addictions. These findings may shed light on the mechanism underlying addiction. Our findings suggest that machine-learning-based approaches to classifying rs-FC offer an additional and valuable technique for understanding large-scale differences in addiction-related neurobiology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30578, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Conflict of Interest         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30619, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "All authors acknowledge that there is no conflict of biomedical financial interests in performing this study or in preparing this manuscript.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30761, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
