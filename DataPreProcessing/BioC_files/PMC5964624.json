Diffusion MRI data were collected in 81 schizophrenia patients (54 first episode and 27 chronic) and 64 controls. Analysis of FA was combined with \u201cfixel-based\u201d analysis, the latter of which leverages connectivity and crossing-fiber information to assess both fiber bundle density and organizational complexity (i.e., presence and magnitude of off-axis diffusion signal). Compared with controls, patients with schizophrenia displayed clusters of significantly lower FA in the bilateral frontal lobes, right dorsal centrum semiovale, and the left anterior limb of the internal capsule. All FA-based group differences overlapped substantially with regions containing complex fiber architecture. FA within these clusters was positively correlated with principal axis fiber density, but inversely correlated with both secondary/tertiary axis fiber density and voxel-wise fiber complexity. Crossing fiber complexity had the strongest (inverse) association with FA (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.82). When crossing fiber structure was modeled in the MRtrix fixel-based analysis pipeline, patients exhibited significantly lower fiber density compared to controls in the dorsal and posterior corpus callosum (central, postcentral, and forceps major). Findings of lower FA in patients with schizophrenia likely reflect two inversely related signals: reduced density of principal axis fiber tracts and increased off-axis diffusion sources. Whereas the former confirms at least some regions where myelin and or/axon count are lower in schizophrenia, the latter indicates that the FA signal from principal axis fiber coherence is broadly contaminated by macrostructural complexity, and therefore does not necessarily reflect microstructural group differences.

However, the extent to which brain dysfunction in schizophrenia may be due to alterations in the structural connections between neuronal populations remains unclear. Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is a commonly used tensor-based measure from diffusion weighted imaging that reflects the relative amount of water diffusion along a principal axis within a voxel of brain tissue. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are associated with decreased FA in many white matter tracts, in particular in the corpus callosum, as well as in fronto-thalamic, fronto-striatal, and fronto-temporal regions. These findings are often interpreted as indicative of reduced myelination or tract \u201cintegrity.\u201d However, the interpretation of FA differences is problematic, particularly in brain regions containing crossing fibers.

B\u202f=\u202f0 images can be leveraged as a second \u201cshell\u201d from which CSF-specific response functions can be estimated in each participant. Modeling the distinct response functions for white matter and CSF in this way makes it possible to apply multi-shell, multi-tissue deconvolution in single-shell data, thereby enhancing the signal from white matter relative to CSF. This strategy is technically referred to as \u201csingle shell, multi tissue\u201d constrained spherical deconvolution (SSMT-CSD), and is useful because the better signal-to-noise ratio ameliorates the problem of white matter volume overestimation that can arise from the standard \u201csingle shell, single tissue\u201d approach. The SSMT-CSD technique has been successfully applied in a recent study of optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis.

One explanation for this situation is that as primary white matter bundles lose density, processes secondary to this loss fill the empty space, and these cells restrict diffusion signal in a way that mimics crossing fibers. There is some limited evidence that this occurs in schizophrenia: studies examining white matter histology in nonelderly postmortem patients demonstrate increases in microglia as well as unusual morphology of myelinated cells. Also consistent with this interpretation, histological analysis in aging macaques observed that the degeneration of axons (and their myelin sheaths) is accompanied by a marked increase in microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocyte processes. The presence of these developmental shifts in white matter content could also partially explain why white matter volume in normally developing humans appears to reach its developmental peak roughly 20\u202fyears later than peak FA. The positive association between age and complexity observed in our sample appears compatible with the idea that age- or illness-related increases in non-axonal cells could manifest as anisotropic diffusion signal. Also supporting this interpretation is the fact that the majority of the patient group difference in complexity across the whole white matter template was attributable to small-density fixels (FD\u202f<\u202f0.1, see Supplemental Fig. 1A versus 1B) that are less likely to represent axonal fiber populations per se, especially considering that fixels with fiber densities in the range of 0.01\u20130.12 were typically observed in gray matter voxels in our sample.
