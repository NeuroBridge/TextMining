Microglia and astrocytes are primary sources of IL-6 in the central nervous system and, when induced, IL-6 can contribute to further inflammatory signaling in brain (reviewed in). MA-induced activation of microglia is dose-dependent and results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1. Our results are in line with studies showing that MA exposure increases IL-6 RNA levels in an astrocytic cell line and that acute MA administration increases IL-6 mRNA levels in striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies provide further evidence for MA-induced inflammation, where individuals with MA dependence exhibit greater microglia activation indexed by [11C] PK11195 positron emission tomography (PET) in midbrain, striatum, orbitofrontal and insular cortex, and lower levels of microglia activation are associated with greater duration of abstinence. Similarly, individuals with MA use disorder show an increase in inflammatory intermediates and the ratio of creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr+PCr) and in prefrontal N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is correlated with MA use. Furthermore, in individuals with MA use disorder, midbrain D2/3 DA receptor binding is positively correlated with gray-matter volume in striatum, amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that the capacity for regulating DA signaling through midbrain DA autoreceptors may mediate the neurotoxic effects of MA and that DA system abnormalities can affect diffuse brain networks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15268, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Consistent with this notion, RSFC studies show that individuals with MA use disorder have stronger midbrain connectivity with DA terminal regions, including striatum and limbic structures and stronger midbrain RSFC is associated with less DA D2 receptor availability and with greater levels of self-reported impulsivity. Corticostriatal RSFC is also associated with less DLPFC activation during risky decision-making in individuals with MA use disorder. We extend these results to show that a peripheral marker of inflammation interacts with the functional connectivity of corticostriatal and mesolimbic systems. As the mesocorticolimbic system modulates a balance between goal-directed and reward-based behavior, the positive relationship between IL-6 and RSFC within the mesolimbic system, along with the negative relationship with corticostriatal RSFC suggests that inflammation dysregulates the connectivity between regions activated by rewarding stimuli and regions involved in executive functioning. Individuals with MA use disorder consistently show enhanced sensitivity for potential reward and diminished cortical inhibition of reward-driven responses, which may result from the altered connectivity of frontostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. This notion is consistent with a recent finding that successful treatment outcomes for alcohol use disorder is associated with RSFC of executive control and striatolimbic networks. The negative relationship between IL-6 and corticostriatal RSFC is also in line with findings from a study of clinically depressed individuals, where C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels were negatively associated with RSFC between ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex. Inflammatory cytokines increase glucose metabolism and extrasynaptic levels of glutamate by decreasing glutamate transporters and increasing astrocytic glutamate release. One potential mechanism for the effect of IL-6 on corticostriatal RSFC is altered glutamate transmission. In the context of MA, activation of mGLUR5 receptors by excess prefrontal glutamate promotes the release and translocation of nuclear transcription factors, which facilitates the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and may contribute to alterations in corticostriatal synaptic activity following repeated stimulant administration. As peripheral markers of immune activation are associated with impaired cognitive functioning and with abnormalities in prefrontal and striatal function, our findings suggest that MA-mediated inflammation may promote the mesocorticolimbic and cognitive deficits that often accompany MA dependence.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17881, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although this study extends our understanding of the effect of inflammation on the connectivity of neural networks implicated in addiction, it is not without limitations. Smoking could also contribute to differences in connectivity. The majority of individuals with MA dependence in this study smoked cigarettes, while only two of the controls were cigarette smokers. Results were significant with and without cigarettes per day as a covariate, but it is not completely possible to dissociate the effects of smoking. Previous studies that have controlled for smoking status, however, have found differences between individuals with MA use disorder and controls in RSFC and in one study amplified the group effect. Although beyond the scope of this study, inflammation can affect brain and behavior through various signaling pathways and through the expression of a number of cytokines and factors. This study examined IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 (and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10) but focused on measures of IL-6, as groups significantly differed in IL-6. More work is needed to interpret the effects of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 on brain function and to evaluate the effects of other immune factors and their interactions. In addition, although results remained significant after controlling for the time between blood draws and scanning, the time between neuroimaging and inflammatory assessments need to be systematically controlled for in future studies. We used a DLPFC ROI that has shown significant group differences in brain function and connectivity between controls and individuals with MA use disorder, however, the DLPFC is a difficult region to define and these results may not generalize towards RSFC of the entire middle frontal gyrus. Lastly, there were only four women with a history of MA dependence in this study, thereby limiting our power to examine the interactive effects of sex. A growing literature, however, highlights sex differences in drug use behavior, and we recently reported that in alcohol use disorder, there are sex differences in the effects of alcohol use history on peripheral immune-related factors [i.e., tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)]. Future studies with more women with MA use disorder are warranted to determine the mechanisms by which inflammation may interact with sex.
