Patients showed prolonged stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and reduced N1, N2, and P3 amplitudes compared to controls. Across groups, P3 amplitudes were maximal after SSRT (i.e., after the time associated with the decision to stop occurred), suggesting that this component indexed response monitoring. Multiple regression analyses showed that longer SSRTs were independently related to 1) patient status, 2) reduced N1 amplitude on successful stop trials and 3) reduced anticorrelated resting state functional connectivity between visual and frontoparietal cortical networks.

Moreover, RSFC has been shown to be useful for investigating brain network abnormalities in Sz, and has the benefit of not being dependent on task performance confounds. In the RSFC approach, complex brain operations are thought to reflect the interplay of multiple, interacting brain networks, including the visual sensory and frontoparietal task control networks that may be specifically relevant to attention-dependent visual task performance.

Alternatively, the resting state RSFC may be trait-like phenomenon that constrains how brain activity patterns occur over a millisecond time frame. It will be useful to conduct analyses using psychophysiological interaction, dynamic causal modeling, and/or neuromodulatory interventions to disentangle these mechanisms. Moreover, it may be useful to assess phase-amplitude coupling between EEG- and RSFC-related frequencies, given that other aspects of phase-amplitude coupling are abnormal in Sz (;).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38245, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For each of the 7 resting state networks, we found reduced network homogeneity, suggesting reduced temporal correlation of voxels within the network.

First, data from a number of participants were rejected because of noisy data or poor performance. However, we used published criteria to determine whom to include. Our data have excellent signal to noise characteristics, which were further improved using ICA, and the included and excluded participants did not differ on demographic variables. The N2 results were somewhat unexpected, in that we did not find a correlation with SSRT. An examination of scalp topography suggested that only 2 channels showed substantial activity in the predicted regions for N2, but we cannot rule out the possibility that N2 measures were derived from less data than the N1 and P3, and thus may have had lower reliability than those peaks. Another limitation is that we did not measure simple RT, which would have allowed us to examine the specific role of speeded responses. Future studies should examine simple RT task as a control condition. Also, all patients were taking antipsychotic medication. In the future, it will be important to study unmedicated patients or those with limited antipsychotic exposure. In addition, our sample size was relatively small. However, our effect sizes were large and our results were largely consistent with, while adding to, extant literature. We also did not use latency adjustment techniques (such as ADJAR) to differentiate potentially overlapping ERP components. However, we had a wide range of SSDs between go and stop signals, which would have disrupted any non-time-locked activity, and indeed the baselines for the grand averages were flat (see Figs. 1C and 2C/D), suggesting that baseline activity was not accounting for the observed effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40955, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, patients with Sz show response inhibition deficits that are associated in parallel with 1) reduced visual sensory response, and 2) greater dependence on anticorrelation between visual and frontoparietal task-control networks. P3 reduction was observed after the stop process, suggesting that this component reflects deficient response monitoring, which may also contribute to impaired inhibitory function. Response inhibition deficits are present in a range of disorders, including Sz, but also ADHD.
