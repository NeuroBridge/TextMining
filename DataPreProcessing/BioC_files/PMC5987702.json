The diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia suggests that the disorder emerges when genetic or acquired diatheses (i.e. vulnerabilities) interact with environmental stressors.

LPFC dysfunction may also contribute to poor emotion regulation in FHR. Both people with schizophrenia and FHR relatives demonstrate reduced ventrolateral prefrontal activity when regulating their emotions using cognitive reappraisal. Similarly, individuals at clinical high risk for schizophrenia (i.e., people with early signs of schizophrenia symptoms), exhibit atypical LPFC activity and cortical\u2013limbic coupling during emotion regulation, as well as reduced tendencies to regulate emotions in daily life.

This represents an obvious dearth in understanding, given that effective emotion regulation is vital for psychological health. In fact, substantial evidence suggests that effective emotion regulation may be especially important for FHR individuals, who appear to be highly sensitive to the impact of negative emotions aroused by social stress. Prior research shows that social stress is a potent environmental risk factor for schizophrenia. Indeed, early research on schizophrenia outcomes focused on expressed emotion, a measure of familial criticism, hostility, and emotional over-involvement. This line of research revealed that familial criticism\u2014one form of social stress\u2014is robustly associated with schizophrenia relapse. Furthermore, this line of work converges with diathesis-stress models of schizophrenia, as one study demonstrated that adverse family environments are associated with schizophrenia onset specifically for FHR individuals. In this study, familial risk and family environment interacted to predict schizophrenia onset: Conversion rates were especially high in FHR individuals exposed to family stressors.

We also found that weak DLPFC activity was associated with increased positive symptoms in FHR participants on days with distressing conflicts, a result that did survive correction for multiple comparisons. Although this effect did not persist into the day after the conflict, this result suggests that strong DLPFC-mediated emotion regulation may be important for reducing both dysregulated mood and actual psychotic-like symptoms following social conflict. Importantly, these results persist after correcting for multiple comparisons and after controlling for age, gender, depressive symptoms, and substance abuse diagnosis.

Consequently, strong DLPFC activity in FHR individuals may protect them from mood and symptom dysregulation following conflict. Clarifying the constituents of the diathesis-stress model in this way contributes to the ongoing discovery of risk factors for\u2014and biological predictors of\u2014schizophrenia. In particular, these data suggest that (i) weak emotion regulation ability and heightened exposure to social conflict may provoke symptoms in FHR individuals and (ii) DLPFC responses to social stress may be a biomarker of those at risk of mood dysregulation and even psychotic-like symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47661, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Daily-diary data revealed two other interesting relationships between FHR status, DLPFC activity, mood, and symptoms. First, FHR individuals responded worse to social conflicts than non-FHR individuals. Interactions between conflict distress and group status were evident on either same-day or next-day analyses of positive mood, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms. This pattern reinforces the notion that social stress is a potent progenitor of psychopathology, especially in individuals at genetic risk. Note, however, that this interaction in predicting positive symptoms does not survive corrections for multiple comparisons or analyses controlling for covariates, suggesting that the result should be further verified. Second, strong DLPFC responses to criticism were broadly protective: Across all participants, increased DLPFC activity was associated with reduced positive and negative symptoms in both same- and following-day analyses. These results may imply that strong DLPFC-mediated emotion regulation abilities are broadly protective against the psychological consequences of social stress. However, these findings did not survive control analyses and thus should be considered preliminary.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48871, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although our data clarify psychological and biological constructs underlying FHR risk, outstanding questions remain. First, our design lacks the fine-grained temporal detail required to outline a process model explaining how weak DLPFC reactions to conflict give rise to elevated symptoms. Future research should use more frequent experience-sampling methods to clarify the affective, cognitive, hormonal, and psychophysiological pathways underlying this relationship. Additionally, although there are many reasons to believe that DLPFC activity in the expressed emotion task tracked emotion regulation efficacy, this cannot be concluded definitively. Cognitive control abilities other than emotion regulation may connect DLPFC activity to daily social and emotional functioning (e.g., working memory or response inhibition). Although finding that activity within an \u201cemotion regulation\u201d Neurosynth ROI is associated with self-reported negative affect following conflict lends credence to the interpretation outlined above, future studies could include additional fMRI tasks to rule out alternative explanations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 49984, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These findings reveal exciting targets for intervention and prevention.
