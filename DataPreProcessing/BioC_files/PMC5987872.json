Graph theoretical methods provide a framework to investigate these defective functional interactions and their effects on the organization of brain connectivity networks. A few studies have shown altered distribution of connectivity within and between functional modules in SCZ patients, an indication of imbalanced functional segregation ad integration. However, no major alterations of modular organization have been reported in patients, and unambiguous identification of the neural substrates affected remains elusive. Recently, it has been demonstrated that current modularity analysis methods suffer from a fundamental and severe resolution limit, as they fail to detect features that are smaller than a scale determined by the size of the entire connectivity network. This resolution limit is likely to have hampered the ability to resolve differences between patients and controls in previous studies. Here, we apply Surprise, a novel resolution limit-free approach, to study the modular organization of resting state functional connectivity networks in a large cohort of SCZ patients and in matched healthy controls. Leveraging these important methodological advances we find new evidence of substantial fragmentation and reorganization involving primary sensory, auditory and visual areas in SCZ patients.

Indeed, psychotic symptoms akin to those of schizophrenia, including hallucinations and delusions, are also observed in certain neurological disorders that involve disruption of corticocortical and corticosubcortical connections.

This mathematical formulation embodies the notion of segregation and integration, as the emergence of modules reflects the balance between intra- and inter-cluster connections. Hence, community detection methods enable investigation of the interplay between functional segregation and integration in the healthy and diseased brain, and provide a means to map the brain's modular organization. Changes in the structure of specific modules in patients may highlight specific circuits or neural substrates affected by the disease.

This limit, first demonstrated for Newman's Modularity, is quite general and affects, to a different extent, all methods that seek to identify the community structure of a network through the optimization of a global quality function, including Reichardt and Bornholdt's, Arenas and Gomez', Ronhovde and Nussinov's, Rosvall and Bergstrom's and others. The introduction of a resolution parameter in the quality function has been proposed as a means to improve detection of smaller clusters.

Indeed, even though previous studies in SCZ populations systematically report substantial changes in functional connectivity and modularity strength compared to healthy controls, differences in the number, size and boundaries of functional modules appear to be modest and inconsistent across studies, often dependent on the specific clustering approach that was adopted.

However, constant edge density may bias group comparisons when the experimental groups exhibit intrinsic differences in connectivity strength, like in the present case. Imposing equal densities for graphs describing connectivity in patients and controls may lead to the inclusion of a greater number of potentially spurious links in the group with weaker connectivity, and to the exclusion of topologically relevant links in the group with stronger connectivity.

We have recently demonstrated that this limit can prevent detection of important details in the structure and organization of resting state functional connectivity networks, thus hampering detection of differences in community structures of different experimental groups. The finer resolution afforded by Asymptotical Surprise enables finer grained analysis of resting state brain networks, and provides improved means to assess differences in patient-control studies.
