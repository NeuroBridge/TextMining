Here, we add to this literature by describing dynamic network connectivities of 78 cocaine dependent (CD) and 85 non-drug using healthy control (HC) participants who underwent fMRI during performance of a stop signal task (SST). Compared to HC, CD showed prolonged stop signal reaction time (SSRT), consistent with deficits in response inhibition. In graph theoretical analysis of dynamic functional connectivity, we examined temporal flexibility and spatiotemporal diversity of 14 networks covering the whole brain. Temporal flexibility quantifies how frequently a brain region interacts with regions of other communities across time, with high temporal flexibility indicating that a region interacts predominantly with regions outside its own community. Spatiotemporal diversity quantifies how uniformly a brain region interacts with regions in other communities over time, with high spatiotemporal diversity indicating that the interactions are more evenly distributed across communities. Compared to HC, CD exhibited decreased temporal flexibility and increased spatiotemporal diversity in the great majority of neural networks. The graph metric measures of the default mode network negatively correlated with SSRT in CD but not HC. The findings are consistent with diminished temporal flexibility and a compensatory increase in spatiotemporal diversity, in association with impairment of a critical executive function, in cocaine addiction.

As spatiotemporal diversity measures how uniformly a brain region interacts with regions in other communities over time, with higher spatiotemporal diversity indicating more evenly distributed interactions across communities, CD may compensate by recruiting interactions across multiple networks to support stop signal performance. These networks likely cover an extensive array of brain regions to support all of the individual component processes of cognitive control, such as attention, response inhibition, error monitoring and post-error behavioral adjustment.

The capacity of response inhibition, as indexed by the stop signal reaction time (SSRT), has conventionally be conceptualized as a reactive control process \u2013 the SSRT quantifies the time needed to interrupt the motor response as instructed by the stop signal. However, more recent studies have described an elaborate neural network, including the DMN, for proactive control and how proactive control interacts with reactive processes to support response inhibition. In addition, earlier studies showed that fluctuation in activity of the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), an important node of the DMN, may reflect moment-to-moment changes in attention and is critically linked to stop signal performance, with higher pgACC activities predicting an impending stop error.

In an electroencephalographic study of social anxiety disorder, graphic analysis of a weighted phase lag index demonstrated increased clustering coefficient and decreased characteristic path length in theta-based whole brain functional organization in patients as compared to controls. Further, the theta-dependent interconnectivity was associated with state anxiety and an increase in information processing efficiency, highlighting a new aspect of attention function, in social anxiety disorder.
