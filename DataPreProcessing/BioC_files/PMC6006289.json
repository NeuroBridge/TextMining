The VS comprises functional subregions and delineation of subregional changes in rsFC requires careful consideration of the differences between addicted and healthy populations. In the current study, we parcellated the VS using whole-brain rsFC differences between CD and non-drug-using controls (HC). Voxels with similar rsFC changes formed functional clusters. The results showed that the VS was divided into 3 subclusters, in the area of the dorsal-anterior VS (daVS), dorsal posterior VS (dpVS), and ventral VS (vVS), each in association with different patterns of rsFC. The three subregions shared reduced rsFC with bilateral hippocampal/parahippocampal gyri (HG/PHG) but also showed distinct changes, including reduced vVS rsFC with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and increased daVS rsFC with visual cortex in CD as compared to HC. Across CD, daVS visual cortical connectivity was positively correlated with amount of prior-month cocaine use and cocaine craving, and vVS vmPFC connectivity was negatively correlated with the extent of depression and anxiety. These findings suggest a distinct pattern of altered VS subregional rsFC in cocaine dependence, and some of the changes have eluded analyses using the whole VS as a seed region. The findings may provide new insight to delineating VS circuit deficits in cocaine dependence and provide an alternative analytical framework to address functional dysconnectivity in other mental illnesses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1787, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1800, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Abundant research of dopaminergic deficits in addiction has focused on the ventral striatum (VS).

For instance, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies showed that the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the VS increased with drug administration, in link with experienced euphoria. As with dopamine receptor blockade, dopamine-specific VS lesioning disrupted self-administration of intravenous cocaine. In a study combining PET and magnetic resonance imaging, dopamine D2 receptor availability in the VS was significantly related to the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to monetary reward in individuals with cocaine dependence (CD).

For instance, vmPFC glutamatergic projections to the NAc were involved in reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Increased Fos expression in the vmPFC, including those neurons projecting to NAc, was associated with context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking.
