However, heterogeneity across different scanners, protocols and populations, renders the task of finding underlying disease signatures challenging. The current work investigates the value of multi-task learning in finding disease signatures that generalize across studies and populations. Herein, we present a multi-task learning type of formulation, in which different tasks are from different studies and populations being pooled together. We test this approach in an MRI study of the neuroanatomy of schizophrenia (SCZ) by pooling data from 3 different sites and populations: Philadelphia, Sao Paulo and Tianjin (50 controls and 50 patients from each site), which posed integration challenges due to variability in disease chronicity, treatment exposure, and data collection. Some existing methods are also tested for comparison purposes. Experiments show that classification accuracy of multi-site data outperformed that of single-site data and pooled data using multi-task feature learning, and also outperformed other comparison methods. Several anatomical regions were identified to be common discriminant features across sites. These included prefrontal, superior temporal, insular, anterior cingulate cortex, temporo-limbic and striatal regions consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, as well as the cerebellum, precuneus, and fusiform, middle temporal, inferior parietal, postcentral, angular, lingual and middle occipital gyri.

In addition to providing individualized indices for diagnostic purposes, machine learning methods may ultimately help identify brain regions affected by disease in subtle ways that can only be elucidated using multi-variate analysis. While most of these neuroimaging studies to date have been performed using single-site datasets, it is essential to integrate multi-site data for two reasons. First, multi-site data provide sufficient statistical power for detecting subtle, but informative patterns of brain structure and function, which may be difficult to unravel with the relative small sample sizes usually acquired in single centers. Second, large sample sizes enhance sample generalizability by pooling large patient populations with diverse demographic features and clinical characteristics including disease onset, symptom severity, and types and duration of treatment. Multi-site studies are therefore becoming increasingly the norm in neuroimaging research.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3573, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Multi-site data reflect a more comprehensive abnormal pattern of disease, and therefore may provide a richer understanding of disease signatures than single-site data. However, two recent studies found that simple pooling of multi-site data did not outperform single-site disease classification. Colby and Nielsen pooled multi-site data and trained a common classifier for all data, to identify attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism, respectively. Results in these two studies showed that the pooled dataset exhibited lower accuracy than each single-site datasets. Here we seek a new approach to synergistically integrating multi-site data, by emphasizing two points. First, since datasets collected in multiple imaging centers have a common disorder of interest (e.g. schizophrenia (SCZ), in our experiments herein), the abnormal patterns in each dataset are strongly related and thus, to some extent, may share a common imaging signature. The pattern reproducibility among multi-site data has been repeatedly demonstrated in several multi-site studies on functional MRI (fMRI), morphometric MRI, and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). Most of these studies arrived at similar conclusions, namely that with appropriate multi-site data collection, different data sites shared highly consistent feature patterns. With this, the site-shared features reveal consistent brain abnormalities in multi-site data, which can lead to a more accurate neurobiological understanding of the psychiatric disorder under investigation. On the other hand, though the integration of multiple single-site data is advantageous, the unavoidable presence of site-specific features might decrease the accuracy of a classifier that merely pools data together across studies. Heterogeneity can emanate from multiple sources including scanner differences, differences in image acquisition protocols, or ethnic and treatment differences among participating patient populations. Given such site-related heterogeneity, multi-site datasets should not simply be merged into larger cohorts for further machine learning investigation. In an attempt to eliminate or reduce the site-specific variability, studies have suggested same scanning protocols, consistent scanner parameters and etc. in data collection, as well as the utilization of smoothness equalization and independent component analysis in data preprocessing. Despite these efforts, site-specific heterogeneities still exist due to their complex causes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6073, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The above considerations highlight the need for a feature-learning framework in multi-site disease classification that can extract the site-shared features, while also accounting for the site-specific features; this approach generally seeks an overarching signature of disease, whereas it accommodates potential sub-cohort and other differences to be taken into consideration. In recent years, multi-task learning has been successful in learning task-shared and task-specific features simultaneously, which effectively improves generalization compared with traditional machine learning methods. For example, support vector machine (SVM) with single-task learning learns a distinct feature pattern and finds a maximum margin hyperplane to classify two groups, which extracts information within a single learning task. In contrast, multi-task learning extracts a subset of task-shared features to generate more accurate models on multiple tasks, with the task-specific features learned simultaneously. The basic assumption of multi-task learning is that the feature weights of different tasks share similar sparse patterns, which can be learned by imposing sparsity regularization penalties on the task weight matrix. l1-norm and l2,1-norm are two commonly used sparsity regulating terms in multi-task learning, which enforces the weight matrix of different tasks to be sparse across all tasks. Particularly, an l1-norm term highlights task-specific features by encouraging the weights of irrelevant features to be very small, while l2,1-norm introduces group sparsity and enforces task-shared features to have larger weights.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7698, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The advantage of multi-task learning makes it suitable for multi-site data learning, considering the site as task, and the site-shared and site-specific features as task-shared and task-specific features.

Specifically, multi-site fMRI data of ADHD was demonstrated better than single-site classification by learning site-shared and site-specific features using multi-task scheme. In this work, though the multi-task learning scheme successfully extracted site-shared and site-specific features in multi-site data, the form of the objective function was rather complex and specific as it included an l2,1-norm group sparsity regularization term and a 6-D spatial structure penalty (generated by the GraphNet, fused Lasso, or the isotropic total variation).

Data pooled from multiple sites alleviate both of these problems at the expense of introducing confounding heterogeneity in the imaging data, which renders the pooled analysis challenging. In our study, using the proposed multi-task feature learning scheme, the classification accuracy of using pooled data was no better than using each single site and, in the case of site C data, pooled learning performed worse than single-site classification. This result might demonstrate that the site-specific features in each data site may not always benefit for the pooled classification. The advantage of the multi-task learning frame in our study is that it can simultaneously learn site-shared and site-specific features, which is suitable when combining multi-site data for disease classification.

Results also showed that accuracies using the proposed classifier were much better than using SVM.

These previous studies have repeatedly highlighted the prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, insular, striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and other temporo-limbic structures as key components of the network of brain regions showing volumetric deficits relative to healthy controls from early stages of SCZ onwards. Most of those brain regions were implicated in our study, indicating a high degree of consistency between the spatial distribution of findings in our site-shared feature analysis and the previous MRI literature on SCZ.

Several structural and functional neuroimaging studies have shown cerebellar abnormalities in SCZ subjects relative to controls. Abnormalities in the cerebellum, through its connections to the prefrontal cortex via thalamus, have been proposed as critical to the state of \u201ccognitive dysmetria\u201d put forward by some authors to explain the behavior manifestations and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. However cerebellar findings should be interpreted cautiously, since segmentation between GM and WM in that region is difficult and prone to errors, due to poor contrast at this imaging resolution. Finally, other brain sites showing volume abnormalities in our study, including the precuneus and lateral parietal cortical regions, fusiform, lingual and middle occipital gyri, have been variably implicated in previous neuroimaging studies of SCZ.

Several recent studies have shown that the continued use of antipsychotics may be significantly associated with some of the neuroanatomical changes detected in MRI studies of SCZ, even after taking into account the influence of other potential moderators such as illness severity and substance abuse. In the present study, participants with SCZ from site B were all in their first psychotic episode and had a relatively shorter duration of illness in comparison to the samples contributed by sites A and C (both of which included a substantial proportion of chronic, medicated SCZ patients). Thus the overall SCZ sample from site B was less exposed to antipsychotic treatment in comparison to the two other sites. The selection of first-episode SCZ patients in site B may help to explain the more modest diagnostic accuracy figures obtained in the single-site analysis for that center in comparison to the two other sites, given the fact that medicated SCZ patients in chronic disease stages display more widespread brain volumetric abnormalities relative to healthy controls than first-episode SCZ patients. Since the three imaging sites contributed each an equal number of SCZ patients and controls to the present investigation, disease chronicity and antipsychotic exposure should be taken as clinical variables that increased inter-site variability in our study, instead of representing unifying features present in all sites. Therefore, the results of the site-shared analysis presented herein can be more safely assumed to reflect the commonality of SCZ neuropathology across the three sites, rather than the potential influence of confounding clinical variables ubiquitously present in the three centers.
