However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying CCS-dependence are yet ill-defined. Therefore, understanding the brain abnormalities in chronic users of CCS is crucial for developing effective interventions. The present study depicted the intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of whole-brain functional networks at the voxel level in chronic users of CCS. In addition, the degree centrality (DC) changes were correlated to the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) total score, dose, duration of CCS use, and the age at first use of cough syrups. The current study included 38 chronic CCS users and 34 matched control subjects. All patients were evaluated using the BIS-11. Next, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) datasets were acquired from these CCS users and controls. Whole-brain connectivity was analyzed using a graph theory approach: degree centrality (DC). CCS-dependent individuals exhibited low DC values in the left inferior parietal lobule and the left middle temporal gyrus, while high DC values were noted in the right pallidum and the right hippocampus (P\u202f<\u202f0.01, AlphaSim corrected). Also, significant correlations were established between average DC value in the left inferior parietal lobule and attentional impulsivity scores and the age at first CCS use.

As CCS is cheap, convenient, and legal to purchase, the abuse of the drug has gained a severe foothold among young individuals worldwide and is considered as an increasing concern in modern society. According to a Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2012, the abuse of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs has continued to spread worldwide since 2009, which poses severe health and social challenges in several countries. In the USA, prescription drug abuse is more prevalent than any other internationally controlled substance except for cannabis. In China, demonstrated that CCS is the maximally abused drug (50% of all documented abused substances) in adolescents. Previous studies have confirmed that mental functioning, behavior, and personality were abnormal in CCS-dependent individuals; these characteristics were similar to those expressed by heroin- and other illicit substances-dependent individuals. However, accumulated evidence has demonstrated that illicit drugs, including heroin, have an effect on brain functional changes as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) Furthermore, the abnormality of impulsive decision making in illicit drug-dependent individuals may be related to the deficient function of the orbitofrontal cortex and the right inferior parietal lobe. Compared to the illicit drug addiction of the so-called \u201cstreet drugs,\u201d less attention has been directed to the illicit use of drugs such as CCS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4179, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The rapid development of neuroimaging techniques has provided many new methods for the detection of early changes in the brain in several neuropsychological diseases. Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), a non-invasive tool for probing the microanatomical organization of human brain white matter (WM) in vivo, has been used to investigate the properties of WM in CCS-dependent individuals. Positron-emission tomography (PET) has also been employed for examining the drug-addicted individuals. found that the perfusion of the orbitofrontal region, the occipital, and the temporal lobes was decreased in heroin addicts; these regions were responsible for the control of attention, motor speed, memory, and visual-spatial processing. demonstrated that the metabolic responses of the right medial orbital prefrontal cortex significantly increased in cocaine-addicted subjects. used the regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis method and found that ReHo was diminished in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and the left dorsal striatum in CCS-dependent individuals. These abnormalities were speculated to be related to the dysfunction of learning and memory in CCS-dependent individuals. Using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis method, also found significantly decreased grey matter (GM) volume in CCS users in the bilateral ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The study further explored the changes in spontaneous functional connectivity of the vmPFC-related circuitry and observed reduced integration in CCS users between the bilateral vmPFC and the bilateral hippocampal complex and between the bilateral vmPFC and the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Enhanced functional connectivity was observed in CCS users between the bilateral vmPFC and the right insula (extending to the right dorsal striatum) and between the bilateral vmPFC and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). These results implied that the vmPFC plays a major role in chronic CCS abuse that might lead to disordered impulsive control. Using independent component analysis (ICA), investigated the intrinsic brain network abnormalities in CCS-dependent males via resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Compared to the healthy control group, the CCS-dependent individuals presented aberrant intrinsic connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and salience network (SN) (P\u202f<\u202f0.05, AlphaSim corrected). However, the limitations of the study included the spontaneous functional connectivity of abnormal brain regions in a subnet of individuals. In addition, the spontaneous functional connectivity of abnormal brain regions in the whole-brain network is unknown. Among the graph-based methods, DC is recently gaining attention. It counts the number of direct connections for a given voxel in a network and reflects the functional connectivity within the brain network. It is one of the more reliable and compelling measures among several nodal network metrics and measures the centrality or importance of individual elements in the brain (for example, brain regions) by capturing their relationships with the entire brain network at the voxel level. Furthermore, DC has been used in several studies where the dorsal and ventral precuneus, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobes showed high DC values in normal individuals, which was found to be in agreement with DMN. Voxel-wise centrality maps provided novel insights into the patterns and complexity of functional connectivity throughout the huge human functional network that has been widely used in brain network studies. In the other studies, the DC measure was not calculated in CCS-dependent individuals. However, the analysis level in the present study using DC is based on voxels. Therefore, the present study aimed to depict the intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of whole-brain functional networks at the voxel level, focusing on network architecture, in CCS-dependent individuals. In addition, we also correlated the DC changes to the BIS-11 total score, dose, duration and the age at first use of CCS. Therefore, we speculated that in CCS-dependent individuals, abnormal activity of some brain regions associated with learning, memory, and executive control might exist.

Previous studies have demonstrated that rats can eliminate a preference for the food reward, craving, and learning ability by the selective destruction of the ventral pallidum (VP), whereas to excite or disinhibit the VP neuron activity, they could promote food craving. The current results suggested that the number of direct connections of the right globus pallidus increased within the brain network in CCS-dependent individuals, indicating the increased activity of the brain region. Thus the increased DC value of the globus pallidus is speculated to promote the craving for addictive drugs in CCS-dependent individuals. Consecutively, the dysfunction of the globus pallidus may indicate the dysfunction of the striatum in CCS-dependent individuals as it is a part of the striatum. The striatum is considered to be associated with stressful experiences. The PET studies revealed that acute stress exposure increased the amount of dopamine release in the striatum. Furthermore, found that stress could induce reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior following a test for food deprivation-induced reinstatement in rats. employed rs-fMRI and found that the connectivity strength was overall high in the striatum in heroin-addicted patients. Furthermore, the study considered that such a dysregulation of the brain regions might lead to a deficit in stress regulatory processes during the resting state. Thus, increased degree values in the globus pallidus in the current study could be correlated to a deficit in stress regulatory processes in drug-addicted patients during the resting state; this postulate can probably provide novel approaches for customized therapies for the treatment of CCS-dependent patients. Moreover, the increased average DC value of the right globus pallidus in CCS-dependent individuals did not show a distinct correlation with the BIS-11 total score. However, found that BIS-11 total scores were correlated with the functional connectivity of the bilateral striatum within the DMN in CCS-dependent individuals as assessed by the independent component analysis method.

The hippocampus plays a critical role in the formation of the pathological memory of addiction. In the case of long-term withdrawal of addiction patients, drug-related stimulus conditions could still strongly recall the experience of using drugs, which is known as \u201caddiction memory\u201d. The pathological memory is closely related to acquiring drug addiction. In an experimental mouse model of addiction, found that stimulating the hippocampus could lead to a strong craving for drugs. The blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors in the dorsal hippocampus of the rats would reduce drug seeking and induce the relapse of the cue. Several studies associated with cocaine-dependent participants noted that participants exposed to cocaine cues showed strong craving for drugs while an increased activity of the hippocampus was observed. used a fallypride (18F) tracer with a high-resolution PET to assess the ability of drug cues in order to induce dopamine (DA) release in the hippocampus of cocaine-dependent participants, and the results showed a dopaminergic response to cocaine cues in the hippocampus. Importantly, these cocaine-dependent participants showed a high degree of desire, leading the investigators to speculate that increased hippocampal activity was related to the memory pathways of cocaine stimulation. Furthermore, in the current study, the abnormal degree values in the right hippocampus demonstrated that the vitality of this region of the brain was increased among learning and memory circuits in CCS-dependent individuals, which contributed to the formation of the addiction memory. However, any significant correlations of the mean degree values in the right hippocampus with the BIS-11 total scores and the duration of CCS use were not observed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23904, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition, we also found decreased degree values in the left inferior parietal lobule and left middle temporal gyrus were related to the cognitive function in the CCS-dependent individuals. A previous study demonstrated that the left inferior parietal lobule, one of the crucial brain regions of the attentional control network, was involved in executive function. The current results suggested that such abnormal intrinsic connectivity may indicate cognitive and executive deficits in CCS-dependent individuals. demonstrated that the frontal-parietal working memory circuits in the cocaine-dependent participants were involved in the enhancement of attention towards drug cues, which were related to the initiation and maintenance of craving. Previous studies also found that the mirror-neuron of the inferior parietal cortex in monkeys was activated during the execution and observation of the identical actions. This finding provided new evidence in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying craving formation and the role of IPL in the process. Therefore, decreased degree values in the left inferior parietal lobule and the left middle temporal gyrus in our study may be related to the deficit of attention and cognition in drug cue response in the addicts. Thus, decreased degree values in both the regions in CCS-dependent patients, based on the functional network integrity perspective, postulate that the function of cognitive control-related regions was weakening. Then, a significantly negative correlation was observed between the decreased average DC value of the left IPL and the subscale of the attentional impulsivity. Thus, we hypothesized that a deficit in cognitive control regulatory processes might occur in CCS-dependent patients during the resting state. When the patients were influenced by drug-related cues, they exhibit a rather intense craving, putatively leading to poor decision making and repeated drug use. also found that the attentional impulsivity correlated with the right IPL within the ECN in CCS-dependent patients; this finding coincides with our results. We also found a significantly positive correlation between the decreased average DC value of the left IPL and the age at the first use of CCS.

Thus, in future studies, it will be interesting to trace the brain regions to which the abnormal functional connectivities are linked. Second, the sample size was relatively small in the present study, which might influence the statistical power to detect specific effects. Thus, additional studies with a large sample size of CCS-dependent patients are needed to improve the power of the statistical analysis of our results.
