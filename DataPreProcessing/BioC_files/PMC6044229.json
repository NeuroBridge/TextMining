Resting state fMRI data from 41 patients with schizophrenia (22 with and 19 without AVHs) and 23 normal controls (NC) were included to compute functional connectivity between brain regions. Classifiers based on support vector machine (SVM) were developed to classify patients with schizophrenia from NC, as well as between the two subgroups of patients. The classification accuracy was evaluated with a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) strategy. The accuracy in discriminating both subgroups of patients from NC was 81.3%, with 92.0% (sensitivity) and 65.2% (specificity) for the patients and NC, respectively. The classification accuracy in discriminating patients with and without AVHs was 75.6%, with 77.3% (sensitivity) and 73.9% (specificity) for patients with and without AVHs, respectively.

In general, these literatures present a full view of large-scale connectivity characteristics in schizophrenia, as well as the central symptom in this debilitating disorder. Exploring the determinants of differences underlying neurobiology functioning as identifying signatures seems to be a promising step to improve understanding the nature of schizophrenia and the diagnosis in psychiatric domain. Most recently, neuroanatomical subtypes of schizophrenia patients was linked with symptoms, aiding disease discrimination for biomarker-based diagnosis. Hence, whether functional abnormalities in relation to psychopathology in schizophrenia hold the capacity to classify disease or symptom needs to be addressed. To this end, classification study is a reliable option by means of MPA. Several studies have related to the classification of SZ vs. controls using resting-state fMRI functional connectivity.
