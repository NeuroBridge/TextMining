While this comorbidity is associated with an increase in disease burden, worse treatment outcomes, and greater economic costs, the underlying neurobiology remains poorly understood. A recent large-scale GWAS of MDD has identified a locus in the TMEM161B-MEF2C region (rs10514299) as a novel risk variant; however, the biological relevance of this variant has not yet been studied. Given previous reports of disrupted reward processing in both AD and MDD, we hypothesized that rs10514299 would be associated with differences in striatal BOLD responses during reward/loss anticipation in AD. DNA samples from 45 recently detoxified patients with AD and 45 healthy controls (HC) were genotyped for rs10514299. Participants performed the Monetary Incentive Delay task in a 3-Tesla MRI scanner. Effects of rs10514299 on striatal activation during anticipation of high/low reward/loss were investigated. Furthermore, we examined associations between rs10514299 and lifetime AD diagnosis in two independent clinical samples [NIAAA: n\u2009=\u20091858 (1123 cases, 735 controls); SAGE: n\u2009=\u20093838 (1848 cases, 1990 controls)], as well as its association with depression severity in a subsample of individuals with a lifetime AD diagnosis (n\u2009=\u2009953). Patients carrying the T allele showed significantly greater putamen activation during anticipation of high reward (p\u2009=\u20090.014), low reward (at trend-level; p\u2009=\u20090.081), high loss (p\u2009=\u20090.024), and low loss (p\u2009=\u20090.046) compared to HCs. Association analyses in the NIAAA sample showed a trend-level relationship between rs10514299 and a lifetime AD diagnosis in the European American subgroup (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.82, p\u2009=\u20090.09). This finding was not replicated in the SAGE sample. In the NIAAA sample, the T allele was significantly associated with greater depression symptom severity in individuals with a lifetime AD diagnosis (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.25, p\u2009=\u20090.02); this association was driven by the African American ancestry subgroup (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.11, p\u2009=\u20090.008). We show for the first time that the previously identified MDD risk variant rs10514299 in TMEM161B-MEF2C predicts neuronal correlates of reward processing in an AD phenotype, possibly explaining part of the shared pathophysiology and comorbidity between the disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2471, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2484, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Alcohol dependence (AD) is a chronically relapsing disorder, characterized by a pattern of compulsive drinking that is maintained despite negative health, social, or occupational consequences. Prevalence rates in the United States of America range from 4.1% in women to 7.8% in men. The etiology of AD is intricate with biological, environmental, and cognitive contributing factors. AD frequently co-occurs with major depressive disorder (MDD). In one study, 20.48% of individuals who met DSM-IV criteria for AD also met criteria for MDD in the previous 12 months, indicating that the odds of MDD are 3.7 times greater for individuals with relative to those without a diagnosis of AD. Subclinical levels of depressive symptoms are experienced by an even larger percentage of patients with AD (80%). This comorbidity significantly increases the disease burden compared to each of the disorders alone. Moreover, it negatively affects treatment outcomes, which further increases economic losses; therefore, improving our understanding of the genetic underpinnings and neurobiological networks involved is important and may be a crucial step towards the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3692, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Both AD and MDD have substantial genetic contributions with heritability estimates of 50\u201360% for AD and 30\u201340% for MDD.

While genetic studies of AD have not been able to identify universal risk variants so far, a recent MDD GWAS using more than 300,000 individuals identified 15 genetic risk loci. The top locus in the joint meta-analysis and the independent replication sample was the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10514299 within the TMEM161B-MEF2C gene cluster. TMEM161B encodes the brain-expressed transmembrane protein 161B, and MEF2C encodes myocyte enhancer factor 2C, a transcription factor involved in brain development that has been associated with epilepsy, intellectual disability, and hyperkinesis; however, it remains unclear what the biological relevance of the rs10514299 variant is.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4851, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One prominent clinical feature shared between both AD and MDD is anhedonia, a disruption in the ability to experience and regulate pleasure, which might be modulated by genetic variants. Clinical and preclinical research indicates that both disorders are associated with disruptions in the mesolimbic reward system, suggesting that its dysregulation might contribute to the comorbidity of AD and MDD. Reward processes are an essential aspect of reward-based learning, specifically, the acquisition of stimulus-action-reward associations, which are crucial for advantageous decision-making and the selection of goal-directed behaviors. The striatum is an important component of the underlying neurocircuitry. Previous research demonstrates that the ventral striatum (i.e., nucleus accumbens) mediates the valuation of rewards and codes for reward prediction errors, while the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) appears to be crucial for stimulus-action-reward learning. The ability to select appropriate behaviors based on available information about rewards and penalties influences an individual\u2019s adaptability to new situations and whether or not desired outcomes can be achieved. Therefore, there has been substantial interest in neural correlates of the anticipation of rewards/losses in substance use populations, including individuals with AD, where impaired decision-making (e.g., continued use despite adverse consequences) and alterations in sensitivity to rewards and punishments have been shown to contribute to alcohol use initiation, maintenance, and relapse. The Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task is a widely used and well-validated measure of reward processing in both healthy populations and those with substance use disorders, including AD.

Our data show for the first time an association of rs10514299 with a neuronal phenotype, namely putamen activation during a reward task. We found that patients with AD who carry the minor allele T showed significantly greater putamen activation during the anticipation of high reward compared to controls (Table 3; Fig. 1a). Furthermore, carrying the T allele was associated with a significant increase in putamen activation during high and low loss anticipation in patients with AD, but with a significant decrease in the controls, indicating that the minor allele T differentially affects this neural phenotype in AD (Table 3; Fig. 1c, d). These data are in line with prior studies that have shown disruptions in the dorsal striatum in individuals with AD during reward anticipation. e.g.,. Neuroimaging studies in humans and neural recording studies in monkeys indicate that the putamen and caudate are involved in different aspects of reward-based learning e.g.,. While the caudate is involved in the coding of prediction errors, the putamen has been shown to mediate stimulus-action-reward associations. Our present study suggests that genetic variation in rs10514299 within the TMEM161B-MEF2C gene cluster may serve as a biomarker for disrupted reward processing in the putamen in alcohol-dependent individuals. Future studies are needed to further investigate the functional relevance of this SNP in individuals with AD and to examine its association with the behavioral impairments in decision-making and reward-based learning that are often observed in AD populations.

A replication attempt using the larger SAGE Sample (n\u2009=\u20093838) failed to replicate this association, suggesting that the effect size of the risk variant in AD is relatively small. This is consistent with the prior GWAS in MDD of 300,000 samples, which reported a rather small effect size (OR\u2009=\u20091.05). Other potential reasons for the lack of replication are presence of confounding factors, such as clinical heterogeneity as individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of AD are more likely to present with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and other substance use disorders. Interestingly, our data showed a marginally significant protective effect of rs10514299 for AD, while Hyde et al. identified the minor allele T as conferring risk for MDD. It is possible that the T allele is a risk allele for MDD and a protective allele for AD, especially given the fact that both disorders present with highly heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. However, it should be noted that a more recent GWAS of 130, 664 MDD cases and 330, 470 HCs did not replicate rs10514299 as a risk variant for MDD, suggesting the possibility that the signal may depend on the presence of other variants or may be driven by other SNPs altogether. Future GWAS with large sample sizes are needed to further elucidate the relevance of rs10514299 and proximal SNPs for an increased or reduced risk for MDD and AD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30995, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To investigate the effect of this SNP on depressive symptoms in AD, we looked at the MADRS in a subsample of the NIAAA Sample. Our data showed that the minor allele T of rs10514299 was significantly associated with greater severity of depressive symptoms in individuals with a lifetime AD diagnosis (Table 4). This association was mainly driven by cases of AA ancestry; however, our sample might have been too small to detect effects across ethnic backgrounds. Furthermore, it should be noted that the medication status for this sample was not available. Given that antidepressant medication may influence the relationship between rs10514299 and depressive symptoms, this finding should be replicated in future studies that assess and control for psychotropic medication status. Importantly, future studies are needed to further investigate this relationship and to examine whether minor allele T carrying individuals with AD might particularly benefit from treatments that focus on negative affect relief, such as mindfulness-based interventions, or antidepressant medications.

Carrying the minor allele T differentially affects putamen activation during reward/loss anticipation in individuals with AD compared to HCs, indicating that genetic variation in rs10514299 may be a clinical biomarker for a neuronal phenotype in AD. Furthermore, the minor allele T was significantly associated with greater levels of depressive symptoms in individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of AD, a finding that was driven by individuals of African American ancestry. Finally, association analyses showed a relationship at trend-level between rs10514299 and a lifetime diagnosis of AD in European Americans in the NIAAA Sample but not in the SAGE Sample. This is the first study to show functional relevance of rs10514299 for an imaging phenotype in individuals with AD, as well as its relevance for depressive symptom severity in individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of AD. Taken together, our findings indicate rs10514299 as a promising target for future study in populations with AD and MDD. Identifying genetic risk variants may serve to guide the selection of treatment options, as well as reveal novel treatment targets, while neuronal phenotypes may serve as markers of treatment response to cognitive, behavioral, or pharmacological interventions.
