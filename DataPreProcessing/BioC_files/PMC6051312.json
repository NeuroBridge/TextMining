Further, learning rate in the CHR group was significantly associated with symptom severity. Both groups showed activation in regions of the CTCC. During early learning, the CHR group exhibited greater engagement of regions of the default mode network, suggesting that they were less able to engage the appropriate task positive networks. During late learning, there were qualitative differences wherein controls showed more prefrontal cortical activation.

With their experimental design and scanning parameters they were able to separately investigate the activation associated with the second-order rule from the processing and activation associated with executing a motor response. They demonstrated activation in the lateral posterior regions of the cerebellum (Crus I and Crus II) during the learning of non-motor rules. This task allows us to investigate learning and internal model formation in the non-motor domain. In doing so, we can test the idea that cognitive dysmetria and dysfunctional internal model formation are present in CHR populations prior to the onset of formal psychosis. If such deficits are present, this would then suggest that cerebellar dysfunction, specifically the formation of internal models, is present prior to the onset of formal psychosis in at-risk individuals, and may be related to the pathophysiology of psychosis.

Additional FMRI data preprocessing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). The following pre-statistics processing was applied: motion correction using MCFLIRT; non-brain removal using BET; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 6\u202fmm; and grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor. Motion artifacts were then removed using automated ICA-based methods. Registration to high resolution structural and/or standard space images was carried out using FLIRT with the Boundary Based Registration (BBR) cost function. Registration from high resolution structural to standard space was then further refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration.

Alternatively, CHR subjects may not have been engaged in the task during early learning, though this is unlikely given our behavioral findings. Late learning, however, was associated with widespread brain activation in both CHR and control participants in right prefrontal cortex (frontal pole and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), bilateral insula, bilateral posterior parahippocampal gyrus, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral Lobule VI (Fig. 3; Table 2). Comparing CHR and control participants revealed greater activation in CHR within bilateral sensorimotor cortex and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (Fig. 4). When comparing early vs. late learning, there were no regions that showed greater activation for early compared to late learning. However, both groups showed significantly greater activation for late vs. early learning, albeit in different regions (Fig. 5; Table 3). CHR participants showed more activation for late vs. early learning in motor cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions, while greater activation in controls was present primarily in the prefrontal cortex.

Using this experimental approach in a population of CHR individuals and healthy controls, we investigated higher-order rule learning and the formation of internal models in the non-motor domain using fMRI. Notably, this is one of very few fMRI studies to be conducted in this important high-risk population, and the first of its kind specifically focused on a learning task that is highly reliant upon the recruitment of cerebellar resources. Behavioral results demonstrated that although CHR individuals learn at a similar rate as healthy controls, they are more negatively impacted by a cognitive challenge under dual-task conditions after learning. This suggests that with additional cognitive interference, perhaps these CHR youth are not as able to rely upon the resulting internal model after learning, or that said model is less efficient. Finally, the rate at which the rules were learned was significantly associated with symptom severity, providing support for the cognitive dysmetria prior to disease onset. Perhaps mirroring the similar learning rates observed for CHR and controls, there were only limited group differences in brain activation, restricted to early learning.

First, it was somewhat surprising that the CHR group learned at a similar rate as the healthy controls. In our prior work looking at procedural motor learning, we found that CHR individuals learned more slowly as compared to healthy controls. There is evidence to suggest that cognitive deficits are present in CHR populations as well and as such we had expected to see learning deficits in the cognitive domain. However, it may be the case that in this sample, though there may be cognitive deficits (which were not directly assessed, a limitation of this investigation), they may not be severe enough to impact learning of second-order rules. Indeed, the impaired dual-task performance, does suggest that with additional cognitive load the CHR group is more negatively impacted. Further, the increased dual-task cost after learning in the CHR group suggests that they did not learn the rules as effectively as the control group. More active processing is still required under the dual-task conditions, suggesting that though the CHR group formed an internal model related to the rules, it was perhaps not as effective, and cannot be relied upon as automatically as in controls, as we recently proposed. This is suggestive of CTCC differences, consistent with what was proposed by Andreasen and colleagues in the cognitive dysmetria framework.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39202, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Also of note were the associations between rate of early learning and symptom severity. During the early learning phase, individuals are forming new internal models, and relying largely upon error information. Though the two groups did not differ in the rate of learning, it seems to be the case that the CHR group does not form internal models that are as effective, or efficient. Further, in the CHR group, we found significant associations between rate of learning, and disorganized symptoms. In our work looking at postural control, a cerebellar-dependent task, we demonstrated unique associations with negative symptom severity, and importantly, postural control predicted negative symptom severity over time. Thus, only a trend-level relationship with negative symptoms was somewhat surprising, though this may be due to the cognitive nature of the task. There are distinct motor and prefrontal (cognitive) cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits and negative symptoms may be more predominantly associated with the motor networks. Here, the task taps into the cognitive regions of the cerebellum (primarily Crus I and II), and found associations with disorganized symptoms. This is particularly interesting, given the assertions of the cognitive dysmetria framework. It is suggested that thought is uncoordinated, and disorganization is just that. Cognitive learning seems to better tap into these symptoms and is consistent with what we would expect within the framework of cognitive dysmetria.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40700, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our analysis of learning-related brain activation focused on early and late learning, defined as the first and last two blocks of the task. Compared with rest, there was little activation during early learning. CHR participants activated the DMN, which is typically deactivated during tasks with cognitive demands. This suggests that CHR individuals may not engage task-positive networks effectively. Related to the symptom associations noted above, it may be the case that those that better activated task-positive networks (or effectively suppressed the DMN), are the individuals with the fewest disorganized symptoms. The map for late learning (in both groups) resembled that of, with notably more prefrontal activation in the current study. Late learning involved a number of prefrontal regions including anterior and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus. While anterior and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices have been associated with third- and forth-order rule learning in previous studies, it was not found by. CHR participants showed greater activation of bilateral sensorimotor cortex compared to controls during late learning. found that this region of cortex was involved in first-order rule learning, suggesting that perhaps CHR participants used less sophisticated strategies for learning. Indeed, when comparing late vs. early learning, controls showed activation of the prefrontal cortex, but CHR participants did not. Finally, in both groups, activation was seen during late learning in cerebellar Lobule VI. This region of the cerebellum has been associated with cognitive processing, and based on the patterns of connectivity of this region, this may be related to the prefrontal activation we found. Notably, unlike in the motor learning literature where a decrease in cerebellar activation has been seen with learning, that was not the case here as demonstrated by the null findings in the early>late learning contrast.

Future work with larger CHR samples is critical. Second, we only investigated these individuals at one time point.
