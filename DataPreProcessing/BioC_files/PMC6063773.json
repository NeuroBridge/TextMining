In contrast, chromatin from our PFC tissue homogenate samples and additional homogenate brain tissue from other sources, fall in between the FACS sorted cells along the first principal component (Figure 1F,G).

Indeed, the neuron-specific enrichment for sequences implicated in schizophrenia risk were consistently more significant than the comparatively weaker enrichment for these risk sequences in the histone modification maps from brain tissue homogenate herein, as well as in published H3K27ac and H3K9ac maps from brain tissue homogenate (Figure 3, Figure S9).

In order to quantify the percentage of variation in histone modification in each peak region that is attributable to each of these four variables plus residual variation, we fit a linear mixed model using variancePartition (Figure 4). Since variance percentages sum to 100%, these values can be easily compared across variables, peak regions and histone marks. The variance percentages are easily interpretable visually: a peak region with high variation across cell types shows distinct levels of histone modification in neuronal versus neuron-depleted chromatin (Figure 4A). The genome-wide trend across all peak regions for each mark indicates that cell type is the strongest source of variation in histone modification, followed by subject (Figure 4B,C). In contrast, variation across brain regions is very limited. Finally, as expected, variation across sexes was minimal genome-wide while exerting a strong effect on chrX and chrY linked genes. Thus, to further clarify the extent by which epigenomic differences between male and female frontal cortex are driven by histone peaks located on the sex chromosomes, we conducted principal component analysis of our 83 H3K27ac samples (11 female, 72 male) including cell-type specific and tissue homogenate datasets.

Unsurprisingly, for each histone mark, functional enrichment by gene categories was highly specific for cell type (Figure 6B). However, differences in histone modification between ACC and PFC were much smaller due to the similarity between the brain regions. Differential histone modification analysis between brain regions in neuronal cells identified 508 H3K4me3 and 10,797 H3K27ac peaks with increased modification in ACC, as well as 696 H3K4me3 and 10,665 H3K27ac peaks in PFC (Figure S14B, S15A\u2013C, Table S11, S12). Interestingly, there was minimal region-specific signal in neuron-depleted chromatin with only 27 H3K4me3 and 18 H3K27ac peaks with increased modification in ACC were identified, and none in PFC (Figure S15D). These results indicate dramatically higher regional specificity for the population of neurons compared to their surrounding non-neuronal cells in the frontal lobe. It remains to be determined whether the differential histone acetylation landscapes in PFC vs. ACC neurons are reflective of differences in neurocognitive function between these cortical areas. For example, there is robust ACC activation with regard to reward processing, pain, affect and emotion. In contrast, dorsolateral PFC is frequently implicated in the regulation of goal directed behavior including working memory and executive functions. We note that multiple peak regions that are differentially modified between PFC and ACC neurons are proximal to neuropsychiatric risk genes (Table S13, S14).

In contrast, histone methylation and acetylation landscapes form ACC and PFC neurons showed considerable \u2018epigenomic distance\u2019 to neuron-depleted and tissue homogenate samples (Figure 1F,G, S5A) suggesting they are likely a poor surrogate for neuron-specific alterations in the context of cognitive function and neurological disease. Given that the differences between neuronal and non-neuronal H3K4me3 and H3K27ac landscapes are the major axis of epigenomic variation (Figure 4), it will be essential for future studies to pursue additional sample fractionation by cell type, in order to capture the estimated 16 neuronal populations defined by single cell RNA sequencing in human cerebral cortex and potentially similar degrees of heterogeneity in glia as recently reported for mouse brain. Such a higher resolution approach is expected to reveal vast numbers of genomic loci with an epigenomic signature unique to a specific type of neuron or glia, and provide deeper insight into the interrelation of transcriptome and histone modification landscapes. We also note the unexpectedly large quantitative H3K27ac differences between cell types, with a much larger genome coverage (20%) in neuronal chromatin decorated by histone acetylation versus only 15\u201316% genome coverage in neuron-depleted chromatin. The extended H3K27ac coverage broadly included intronic and intergenic sequences in addition to many promoter-bound peaks (Figure S12). While the functional implications of the extended H3K27ac peak coverage in the neuronal genome remains to be explored, we note that drugs interfering with the regulation of histone acetylation, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and suppressors of histone-acetyl-reader proteins, show a surprisingly broad therapeutic profile, improving cognition and neuronal function in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disease models. Furthermore, consistent with previous gene expression profiles in adult frontal cortex, the transcriptional histone marks of the present study, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, showed few sex-specific histone methylation and acetylation differences in the autosomal genome (Figure S11). However, previous DNA methylation profiling in cortical tissue homogenate from elderly brains revealed sex-specific effects for approximately 10% of age-sensitive methyl-CpG marks.
