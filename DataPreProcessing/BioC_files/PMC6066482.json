The purpose of this study is to investigate the structural connectivity characteristics and driving-control subnetwork patterns of reward circuits in heroin abusers and assess the genetic modulation on the reward network. We first defined the reward network based on systematic literature review, and built the reward network based on diffusion tensor imaging data of 78 heroin abusers (HAs) and 79 healthy controls (HCs) using structural connectomics. Then we assessed genetic factors that might modulate changes in the reward network by performing imaging-genetic screening for 22 addiction-related polymorphisms. The genetic association was validated by performing genetic associations (1032 HAs and 2863 HCs) and expanded-variant analysis. Finally, we estimated the association between these genetic variations, reward network, and clinical performance. We found that HAs had widespread deficiencies in the structural connectivity of the reward circuit (center in VTA-linked connections), which correlated with cognition deficiency. The disruptions synchronously were shown on the reward driving system and reward control system. GABRA2 rs279858-linked variants might be a key genetic modulator for heroin vulnerability by affecting the connections of reward network and cognition. The role of the reward network connections that mediates the effects of rs279858 on cognition would be disrupted by heroin addiction.

In recent decades, the prevalence of heroin abuse and on-medical prescription opioid use sharply increased in the USA and Europe.

Despite the diversity in chemical structure and molecular targets, addictive drugs mediate their reinforcing properties by increasing dopamine (DA) concentrations in reward circuits, primarily in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and its major projections (i.e., nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)). Drug addiction is hypothesized to develop from an imbalanced dual system in these reward circuits, the hyperactive reward motivation (mainly involves VTA and NAc) and hypoactive reward control (mainly involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)).

In our previous work using the whole-brain deterministic tracking analysis, we observed that HAs exhibited widespread increase in connective strength (fiber number-weighted) mainly in default-mode, attentional and visual systems. However, the convergent changes in the reward circuit, the most critical system for addiction, were insufficient for analysis. The reward network has a significant amount of neural projections. Hence, we adopted the probabilistic fiber tracking method, which is more effective at determining the crossing fibers and intricate branching configurations than the deterministic approach. By adopting the FA-weight probabilistic tracking approach, we observed the widespread decrease and no increase in connections in the reward network of HAs. These results were rather unexpected since it is generally considered that in addiction the reward-driving network was increased, whereas the reward-control network was decreased. Heroin use may trigger numerous forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain reward regions, and reduce inefficient and redundant neurons for acquiring sensitization toward addiction-related cues. The neurotoxic effects of heroin are involved in loss of gray matter and white matter, cognition, neuronal apoptosis, synaptic defects, depression of neurogenesis, and so on. The number of synapses, dendritic spines density, and membrane resistance of VTA dopaminergic neurons could be profoundly affected by chronic morphine use. Consequently, HAs could have deficiency in myelination integrity and dendritic spine density of neural fibers within the reward network, which reflected by the deficiency in DTI-based connectivities.

The VTA is considered as an essential center for reward and motivation. The main reciprocal projections of the VTA are with NAc, mPFC (especially OFC), and AMY, and these connections form the core of the reward-loop. Our finding suggests the main structural connections that are damaged in heroin addiction are presented at the core projections of the reward circuit, which parallel the reward driving system and reward control system. A possible explanation is that the initial drug-induced plasticity in the DAergic midbrain and subsequently in the VStr would recruit more dorsal striatal regions during chronic drug use and reshape the connectivity within these projections. This leads to compulsive drug dependence at the late stages of addiction. Hence, the driving and control subnetworks of the reward circuit would have compact interactions and operate together to monitor reward processing.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29009, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "GABAA \u03b12 receptor which encoded by GABRA2 located on chr4p12 was highly expressed in the mesolimbic DA reward pathway, including HIP and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and VTA (Supplementary Fig. 3a). GABRA2 rs279858, a synonymous SNP in exon 5 of GABRA2, was the most common examined tag-SNP in the chr4p12 addiction-related region. GABRA2 rs279858 was associated with diversity of reward activation especially during adolescences. The chromatin state data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project demonstrated that there was a weak transcription and enhancer signal in the LD block of rs279858 in brain-related tissues (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The association between GABRA2 rs279858*G and addiction risk has been reproducibly validated across different populations and different drug addictions (including heroin, alcohol, and cocaine). In line with previous studies, we provided evidence of the association between GABRA2 rs279858 and variants in the rs279858-linked low-expression haplotype block with heroin addiction vulnerability. GABAA receptors may influence the opiates-reduced excitability of DA neurons within the reward pathway (GABAA \u03b12 receptors are highly expressed). The rs279858 variant may affect the distribution pattern of GABAA \u03b12 receptors that may be implicated in weaker neural connectivity in reward-loop and less inhibition of DA neurons, which results in the increased risk for addiction via developmental mechanisms. However, addictive drug use could alter the expression of GABAA subunits genes. We have also speculated and assessed the epigenetic modifications of GABRA2 may be involved in the gene\u2013heroin interaction. However, we have not found significant group difference for the epigenetic rate of CpG island in part of GABRA2 promoter, as well as its correlation with rs279858 and addiction characteristics.
