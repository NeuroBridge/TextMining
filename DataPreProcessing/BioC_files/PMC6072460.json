In this work, we show there is a direct link between the two, and show that there are some important differences between the two approaches in terms of what information they capture. We developed an enhanced connectivity-matrix independent component analysis (cmICA) for calculating whole brain voxel maps of functional connectivity, which reduces the computational complexity of voxel-based connectivity analysis on performing many temporal correlations. We also show there is a mathematical equivalency between parcellations on voxel-to-voxel functional connectivity and simplified cmICA. Next, we used this cost-efficient data-driven method to examine the resting state fMRI connectivity in schizophrenia patients (SZ) and healthy controls (HC) on a whole brain scale and further quantified the relationship between brain functional connectivity and cognitive performances measured by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) battery. Current results suggest that SZ exhibit a wide-range abnormality, primarily a decrease, in functional connectivity both between networks and within different network hubs. Specific functional connectivity decreases were associated with MATRICS performance deficits. In addition, we found that resting state functional connectivity decreases was extensively associated with aging regardless of groups. In contrast, there was no relationship between positive and negative symptoms in the patients and functional connectivity.

Seed-based approaches find the connectivity of a seed to the rest of the brain. The seed can be a collection of points based on prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies or be based on an atlas, in which case it is a seed with a larger region-of-interest (ROI). The advantage of this method lies in its simplicity, which pinpoints directly the voxel regions to which the seed region is connected. However, seed-based methods are hypothesis driven which requires prior knowledge of seeds or ROIs whose representativeness is not always reliable. The information of a functional connectivity map from this type of method is restricted and biased to a selected seed region, leaving undetermined the connectivity patterns on a whole-brain scale. ICA on the other hand is data driven and computationally efficient in examining general connectivity patterns from whole brain. ICA yields brain voxel regions with strong temporal coherence, seen as intra-connected maps. However, the spatial network/connectivity maps identified by ICA are derived by maximizing statistical independence from each other, and its interpretation in terms of connectivity coherence may not be as straight-forward as seed-based results. The ICA approach may in some cases only detect localized synchronous voxels in a partial intrinsic network (e.g., the split regions of default mode network) especially when using high model orders. To study connectivity across different networks, ICA is usually employed in a component/regional macroscopic scale often with a focus on inter-network connectivity, called functional network connectivity or FNC.

Voxel-based connectivity maps have been studied to look for brain connectivity differences in schizophrenia with diffusion imaging and with resting-state fMRI data. These voxel-based connectivity maps have high dimension (N\u00d7N), where N is the number of brain voxels. This is not only computationally expensive, but a direct comparison of these connectivity maps across groups can lead to underestimation of important differences after correcting for multiple comparisons. The cmICA method was developed as one way to address this problem, and it has been previously applied to parcellate whole brain diffusion imaging data. In that paper, we show that cmICA can be used for dual parcellation of the brain connectivity (regardless of it being structural or functional). The dual parcellation consists of a set of spatially independent maps S and a corresponding dual set of spatial maps R, such that R defines the brain connectivity magnitudes from independent sources S to the whole brain (see Discussion). Here we propose a computationally optimized cmICA for functional connectivity data. We apply the enhanced cmICA to resting state fMRI data collected from 60 SZ and 61 HC.

The temporal concatenation approach assumes common aggregate spatial maps S across subjects but allows for unique time courses T for each subject. This assumption (stationary on S but nonstationary on T) makes the variabilities on time courses T are much larger than on spatial maps S. Although spatial ICA decomposition of functional connectivity matrix in cmICA does not naturally contain time courses, mathematically they are equivalent to separate input data into two parts, loadings by independent spatial maps. In fMRI data, it yields time courses T and spatial maps S; in functional connectivity matrix data, spatial ICA yields connectivity maps R and spatial maps S.
