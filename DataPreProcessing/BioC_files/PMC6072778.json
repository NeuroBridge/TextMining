Mapping cognitive capability onto brain imaging has the potential to provide clues by exploiting links among enriched types of imaging and behavioral information for individuals. Here a neuromarker is defined as a brain measure that is associated with a cognitive or behavioral outcome that can predict individual performance. Neuroimaging techniques like structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have enabled identification of neuromarkers that bring psychiatry from subjective descriptive classification into objective and tangible brain-based measures. For example, Rosenberg et al. demonstrated that whole-brain functional connectivity strength may serve as a neuromarker of sustained attention for both healthy and disease assessments. Finn et al. showed that functional connectivity (FC) profiles can predict levels of fluid intelligence. Drysdale et al. further used FC patterns to define novel subtypes of depression that may benefit treatment outcome prediction.

SAN deficits in schizophrenia have been linked to reality distortion, suggest that SAN abnormality may contribute to impaired salience that is associated with hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia. Together with other consistent findings, we speculate that SAN in GM may have a crucial role as a structural substrate for neurocognition. Moreover, CEN was detected in both fALFF and GM in our results, which is important for maintaining and manipulating information in decision-making, working memory, and problem solving.

This is consistent with the fact that memory shows pronounced deficits in SZ, with working memory primarily affected. In addition, attention encompasses a variety of functions that includes information selection, enhancement of selected information and inhibition of unselected information. We detected GM volume reduction in key nodes of the SAN (bilateral insula and ACC in blue frame as in Fig.\u00a04) and dlPFC associated with attention deficits in SZ. Accordingly, SAN is known to be involved in a variety of monitoring, attention switching, and decision-making processes.
