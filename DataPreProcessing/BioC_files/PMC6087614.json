Resting-state functional connectivity has shown potential in identifying these alterations. Nicotine addiction has been associated with detrimental effects on functional integrity of the central nervous system, including the organization of resting-state networks. Prolonged stress may result in enhanced activation of the default mode network (DMN). Considering that biofeedback has shown promise in alleviating physiological manifestations of stress, we aimed to explore the possible neuroplastic effects of biofeedback training on smokers. Clinical, behavioral, and neurophysiological (resting-state EEG) data were collected from twenty-seven subjects before and after five sessions of skin temperature training. DMN functional cortical connectivity was investigated. While clinical status remained unaltered, the degree of nicotine dependence and psychiatric symptoms were significantly improved. Significant changes in DMN organization and network properties were not observed, except for a significant increase of information flow from the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and right temporal pole cortex towards other DMN components. Biofeedback aiming at stress alleviation in smokers could play a protective role against maladaptive plasticity of connectivity.

Among those networks that have been identified, the default mode network (DMN) has drawn attention as a state of organized baseline brain function. It has been suggested to be involved in self-awareness and self-referential thought processes and episodic memory. The exact definition of DMN nodes shows some variation between studies. Nonetheless, a number of important DMN nodes can be safely identified with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus (PCU), medial and lateral prefrontal cortices (mPFC, dlPFC, and vlPFC), inferior parietal cortex (IPC), and areas of the temporal lobe, including the lateral temporal cortex (LTC), the temporal pole (TPC), and middle temporal lobe (mTL).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2675, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A chronic smoking habit has been associated with negative functional and structural effects on the central nervous system. These effects include decreased neurocognitive capacity, as well as the atrophy of grey and white matter of the brain in frontal, prefrontal, cingulate, temporal, and frontoparietal sites, among others. Functional brain connectivity has also been shown to be affected in smoking, characterized by a disorganization of efficiency-related resting-state network topological properties. Heavy smokers showed lower global efficiency of both whole-brain network and DMN, as well as increased clustering and greater path lengths. Moreover, these changes were associated with the severity and duration of smoking-habit abuse. Resting-state connectivity of prefrontal areas, involved in the facilitation of drug response- and reward-related mechanisms, has been shown to be enhanced in smokers and such findings have been suggested as biomarkers of addiction. In general, DMN connectivity appears to show some impairment and decrease in smokers but other functional brain networks, especially those involved in executive functions and cognition, are also affected by the addiction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3871, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Moreover, stress that is present in different stages of the nicotine addiction cycle seems to affect the organization of DMN. In a recent study by Soares et al., prolonged stress was found to lead to greater activation of resting-state networks including the DMN, DAN, VAN, SM, and VN networks. Focusing on DMN, they found that stress resulted in the augmented activation of DMN, mainly in the inferior parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and medial orbitofrontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Increased activation of anterior DMN components could suggest an increase in self-subjective thoughts and a dynamic interplay between regions associated with emotional processing and cognitive functions. Moreover, the enhanced activation of inferolateral parietal lobes, along with the precuneus, could be linked to episodic memory retrieval and longer emotional stimuli processing. Similar findings of DMN activation were shown in another recent study investigating the role of social stress in resting-state networks, using the cyberball task.

Furthermore, acute chronic stressors, perceived stress, childhood adverse experiences, and negative life events have been found to increase the risk for smoking uptake and therefore for smoking initiation and experimentation. Smoking status was found to vary with diverse stress indices, and stressful conditions were found to lead to an increase of smoking urge, amount, and intensity. Moreover, a causal link between stress and smoking seems to be well-established during the maintenance phase. Increased stress was also observed when comparing stress levels at different time conditions, resulting in relapse (prior to quitting and 1\u2009month, 3\u2009months, and 6\u2009months of abstinence). However, stress levels were differentiated depending on the outcome of abstinence. In more detail, smokers who remained abstinent experienced a steady decrease in stress over time, while those who failed to quit smoking or were abstinent for only a brief period were consistently characterized by relatively high stress levels.

Both stress and smoking induce changes in the connectivity between the main hubs of the resting-state networks of the cortex. Hence, the goal of the present study was to investigate whether a biofeedback intervention that aims to alleviate the stress induced during a smoking-cessation attempt might play a protective role, affecting the reorganization of the resting-state cortical networks. A schematic representation of the research area explored is displayed in Figure 10. To this aim, we used a multimodal approach investigating clinical, behavioral, and neurophysiological (EEG) indices before and after the application of 5 sessions of skin temperature biofeedback. Stress seems to be involved at every stage of the nicotine dependence cycle, as we have already mentioned, from preparation to initiation of smoking up to episodes of relapse (Figure 10(b)). Individuals characterized by higher stress levels can be considered at high risk of adopting a smoking habit. Various stress characteristics and indices have been associated with different stages of the cycle. Although a causal link between stress and smoking appears well established, it has not been clarified whether and how intervening to alleviate stress can also meaningfully impact the behavioral aspects of a smoking habit. If such an effect can be identified, the mechanisms could be explored along the lines of covarying effects on different levels of brain function, the organization of resting-state self-referential networks, such as the DMN, being an obvious target.

Free radicals are responsible for oxidative damage on multiple cellular tissues' constituents such as membrane protein lipids and DNA. Additionally, the imbalance between the increased production of free radicals and decreased capacity of antioxidants leads to complicated pathological responses including an inflammatory immune response. Results indicated that the total oxidative stress showed a nonsignificant decrease in the post-, compared to the preintervention measurement, implying that at a clinical level, 5 sessions of skin temperature biofeedback did not cause a significant decrease of stress-related clinical indices.

It shows anatomical connectivity with subcortical structures, such as the striatum and putamen and temporal areas, supporting its role in emotional and working memory circuits. Based on the fact that vlPFC is strongly involved in working memory, its increased connectivity with the resting-state network could show a heightened attention involvement during the resting state which may be related to smoking abstinence, as previous research shows. Abnormal connectivity between medial PFC and lateral PFC in smokers has also been found in a previous resting-state fMRI study, highlighting the role of this region in nicotine addiction. A prominent theory regarding vlPFC is that it acts as a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d of ongoing cognitive processes when motivationally salient stimuli appear. Its connections to the major nodes of the DMN imply a stronger coupling of large-scale resting networks, including the salience, default, and executive control networks in nicotine addiction. This finding is also in line with previous research in the field. Importantly, the increase of its outgoing functional connectivity to the prominent DMN nodes indicates a positive reorganization of the network, minimizing negative affective states as well as deficits in cognitive abilities related with nicotine addiction. This is an interpretation which may be supported by the recent three-network model of addiction proposed by Sutherland et al.. The fact that the increase of out-strength of this region compared to the rest of the network does not cause reorganization of the overall network, as shown in the corresponding analysis, is probably due to the fact that this node was not among the top contributors to the network outflows in either time condition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44096, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Similarly to the network properties of vlPFC, the TPC also reveals a significant increase in its out-strength connectivity to the rest of the DMN nodes in the post- compared to the preintervention measurement.

A recent fMRI study also associates this region with nicotine dependence severity, while the reduced functional connectivity of this region is associated with emotional dysfunction. Hence, the increase of TPC functional connectivity outflow could be indicative that the biofeedback intervention may have contributed to a protective reorganization in the DMN. A possible mechanism can be explored along the enhancement of network components that are related to positive emotional and autobiographical processing. The TPC has been associated with the integration of information from diverse modalities and has been shown to strengthen its coupling to the areas it modulates through emotional music. Our BF paradigm incorporates pleasant relaxing audio and video, that is played on when the subject succeeds in the temperature increase task, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed enhancement of TPC connectivity. Furthermore, female participants also significantly increased inflow to this area, something that could be explored along the lines of gender differences, since females have been shown to be more responsive to emotional stimuli. In accordance to the vlPFC results, the significant out-strength or in-strength increases of TPC did not reorganize the overall DMN.

In the meantime, as already mentioned, a number of studies have reported neurocognitive dysfunction in stress and smoking, associated with addiction, award-related mechanisms, and emotional association, as portrayed in enhanced connectivity of prefrontal areas and the precuneus.

Our results could be interpreted as an indication that short-term biofeedback training, focusing on stress alleviation in active smokers, may play a protective role against the addiction-related dysfunction of resting-state functional connectivity, thereby preparing the grounds for extended neurofeedback training.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50841, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Data Availability", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50859, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Data is stored at the SmokeFreeBrain project database (http://db.smokefreebrain.eu/) which is not currently publicly available.
