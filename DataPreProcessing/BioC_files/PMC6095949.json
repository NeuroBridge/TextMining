In the current study, 20 schizophrenia patients and 16 controls completed two tasks using point-light animations during fMRI: a basic biological motion task and an emotion in biological motion task. The basic biological motion task was used to localize activity in posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a critical region for biological motion perception. During the emotion in biological motion task, participants viewed brief videos depicting happiness, fear, anger, or neutral emotions and were asked to decide which emotion was portrayed. Activity in pSTS and amygdala was interrogated during this task. Results indicated that patients showed overall reduced activation compared to controls in pSTS and at a trend level in amygdala across emotions, despite similar task performance. Further, a functional connectivity analysis revealed that controls, but not patients, showed significant positive connectivity between pSTS and left frontal regions as well as bilateral angular gyrus during the emotion in biological motion task.

Primate studies, as well as more recent neuroimaging studies in humans, have identified other key regions within this circuit, including amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, which receive projections from pSTS.

However, in the current study patients did not show increased activation in either pSTS or amygdala in response to the neutral videos relative to other emotion types. Also, schizophrenia patients rated neutral animations similarly to controls. The differences between our findings and those from faces might be due to differences in stimulus type (e.g., static faces versus whole-body point-light animations) or to differences in difficulty level between the methods used. Further, exploration of activity by emotion type showed a significant condition effect in pSTS, but not amygdala, that was driven by greater activation during the anger condition compared to other emotion types. This heightened response to anger is consistent with the notion that threat-related signals are subject to enhanced neural processing, perhaps because they are associated with greater salience or arousal (e.g.,.

We do not know whether similar patterns of regional activation or functional connectivity differences would be observed in recent-onset or unmedicated individuals. In addition, we chose to utilize a basic biological motion task that did not require participants to actively discriminate biological from non-biological motion. This prevented us from being able to examine relationships between BOLD activation patterns and behavioral performance. In addition, the Emo Bio task we used included only four response options (\u201chappy,\u201d \u201cafraid,\u201d \u201cangry,\u201d and \u201cneutral\u201d), whereas previous versions of the task included a fifth emotion condition: \u201csad.\u201d This modification was necessary because we were limited to a 4-button response box in the fMRI scanner, and, as a result, needed to limit the conditions to 4 emotions. We considered it to be important to include a neutral condition, a positive emotion (happy), and two versions of negative emotions (fear and anger) that are both known to activate the amygdala robustly. That meant that the sad condition was not part of our paradigm. We believe that this modification, while not ideal, had minimal impact on the results and conclusions from this study because we were still able to assess neutral, positive, and negative emotions.
