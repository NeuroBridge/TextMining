Study hypotheses were tested using a sample of rural African Americans who were followed from late childhood through emerging adulthood.

For example, negative parent-child interactions during childhood have been found to influence brain connectivity in neural networks relevant to emotion regulation, threat detection, and reward anticipation. Similarly, during adolescence, a positive parent-child relationship as defined by parent-child communication behaviors (i.e., support, disclosure, and conflict) predicted ventral striatum activation to rewards over time. Conversely, hostile family relationships (i.e., high conflict, low cohesion) forecast increases over time in prefrontal cortex activation during a cognitive control task. However, little research has examined the ways in which parenting may influence functional connectivity, another key indicator of overall brain functioning. Although speculation has surrounded the effect of parenting on rsFC in adulthood, parental influences on integrative brain networks remain understudied, particularly with African American samples.

Moreover, given evidence suggesting neurobiological overlaps between addiction to substances and addiction to foods, similar brain networks may play prominent roles in both harmful alcohol use and emotional eating. One particular network that may contribute to both forms of overconsumption behavior is the anterior salience network (ASN), the central nodes of which are the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula. Prior work has demonstrated that the ASN functions as a neural mechanism involved in switching activation and deactivation patterns from the central executive network to the default mode network and vice versa. Therefore, a more coherent and synchronous ASN (i.e., greater rsFC) may allow more efficient switching between the central executive and default mode networks, thereby facilitating adaptive and regulated behaviors. Given the highly arousing nature of psychoactive substances and food as stimuli, behaviors related to substance use and emotional eating may be particularly relevant to the ASN, with greater connectivity of the ASN potentially associated with lower levels of harmful substance use and unhealthful eating behaviors. For instance, research on smoking has demonstrated reduced rsFC of the ASN in smokers compared with nonsmokers. Studies have also found a negative correlation between rsFC of nodes within the ASN and severity of smoking in both smokers with schizophrenia and smokers matched as controls.

Although it is not surprising to see overlapping brain regions underlying substance use and disordered eating, with alcohol use and dysregulated eating, in particular, following divergent trajectories, questions arise concerning why an individual with low ASN rsFC migrates down one path versus the other. One possible explanation may be differences in the level of stimulation an individual wants when self-soothing with consumable products. Although both harmful alcohol use and emotional eating can be considered coping behaviors, long-standing research has demonstrated a positive association between sensation-seeking and drinking. Recent research, however, has found a negative association between sensation-seeking and compulsive eating. Alternatively, environmental factors may play a role, such as a heavily drinking social niche that provides alcohol and normalizes its use as a self-coping behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24969, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24997, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Limitations of the current study must also be noted. First, the sample intentionally included only African Americans as an understudied population that is disproportionately at risk. The homogenous nature of this sample may limit generalizability beyond rural African Americans; however, this characteristic may also restrict potential confounds. Second, the study design limits conclusions regarding causality. In particular, measurement of the rsFC of the ASN and the outcomes of harmful alcohol use and emotional eating around the same time point prevent strict inferences about directionality. Power considerations also precluded a more exhaustive list of control variables. The current approach, however, is consistent with control variables included in other models testing neural pathways linking childhood experiences and later developmental outcomes. Although the current results are promising, future research with larger samples is needed that includes a larger set of predictor variables. Furthermore, a reliance on self-report measures (parent-child communication, harmful alcohol use, and emotional eating) may introduce a degree of method bias. The loss of 28 subjects due to fMRI processing may also be a limitation. However, due to the sensitivity of resting state data, it is not unexpected. Finally, functional connectivity of the ASN was only assessed using resting state data and not also during a task.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26422, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite these limitations, the current results illuminate pathways for two forms of adverse health-risk behaviors in an at-risk population. Harmful alcohol use and emotional eating may indeed be coping strategies for African Americans facing strenuous circumstances as they navigate emerging adulthood in an environment abounding with risk factors and the potential for adverse outcomes. The present study demonstrates that parenting in childhood may act as a protective factor against these health-risk behaviors by influencing rsFC of the ASN which, in turn, might suppress harmful alcohol use and emotional eating. Furthermore, study findings support the role of prevention efforts design to improve parenting skills, given the centrality of parenting to a host of lifelong outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27209, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27232, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "We also examined the bivariate association between other potential confounds (e.g., SES risk, intervention status, current stress) and all dependent measures in the study.
