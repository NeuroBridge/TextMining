This effect of lorcaserin and its ability to reduce nicotine self-administration in rats may reflect links between the 5-HT2C receptors and the dopaminergic reward system.

As the participants were exclusively young smokers with short smoking histories and mild-to-moderate levels of nicotine dependence, as expected from smokers within this age range (e.g.,), the results may not be generalizable to the wider population of smokers. Also, the small sample size and uneven gender distribution made it difficult to examine the influence of sex.
