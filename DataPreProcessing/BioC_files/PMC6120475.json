Evidence suggests craving elicited by re\u2010exposure to drug cues may precipitate relapse. Attempts to identify neural biomarkers of cue\u2010elicited craving have yielded inconsistent findings. We aimed to apply a novel continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging technique to follow the minute\u2010to\u2010minute evolution of brain responses, which correlate with the waxing and waning of craving. Newly detoxified male opioid\u2010dependent patients and healthy control participants attended two separate, counterbalanced, functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning sessions during which they viewed a 10\u2010minute video (drug cue or neutral cue) followed by 5\u00a0minutes of fixation. Participants rated the intensity of their craving throughout each session. We hypothesized that subcortical/ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions and dorsal PFC regions would show different associations with craving reflecting their putative roles in appetitive processing versus cognitive control. Compared with controls, drug cue (minus neutral cue) video recruited the left amygdala and was temporally correlated with craving. In contrast, dorsal anterior cingulate blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level\u2010dependent signal time course was higher than controls only during a period after cue exposure when craving levels were declining. Against expectations, neither the ventral striatum nor ventral PFC was significantly recruited by drug cue exposure. Findings suggest that the amygdala has a central role in craving, whereas the dorsal anterior cingulate may control craving in treatment\u2010seeking patients. Time course analysis yielded new insights into the neural substrates of craving that could objectively validate development of psychological and pharmacological approaches to sustained abstinence.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1972, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1985, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Neural and psychological responses to stimuli or contexts previously associated with drug reward (i.e. drug cues) play a significant role in drug dependence (Lubman, Yucel, & Pantelis 2004; Epstein et al. 2009). Conditioning mechanisms increase the incentive value of these cues, creating powerful secondary reinforcers that can capture attention and elicit craving (Tiffany & Wray 2012), and contribute to further drug seeking and drug taking. Consistent with this notion, several studies have reported that craving measured before or during treatment can predict subsequent relapse (Weiss et al. 2003; McHugh et al. 2014), whilst \u2018real\u2010time\u2019 craving and cue exposure have been shown to immediately precede relapse and drug use (Epstein et al. 2009; Moore et al. 2014; Fatseas et al. 2015). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have attempted to identify brain systems that mediate cue\u2010elicited craving (Zijlstra et al. 2009; Li et al. 2012; Jasinska et al. 2014). Two recent meta\u2010analyses of these studies (Chase et al. 2011; Kuhn & Gallinat 2011) report reliable activation to drug cues within regions including the amygdala and ventral striatum, which are important for processing reward\u2010related stimuli and motivation (Haber & Knutson 2010), and medial prefrontal regions. These include the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VmPFC) (Chase et al. 2011), which is involved in the representation of reward value and reward\u2010related decision making (Elliott, Agnew, & Deakin 2008; Grabenhorst & Rolls 2011), and the anterior cingulate cortex (Kuhn & Gallinat 2011), which is important for reward and error\u2010related behavioural and cognitive control (Shenhav, Botvinick, & Cohen 2013). Although there are some consistencies in the regions that are activated by drug cues, there is little evidence that any reliably correlate with craving (Tiffany & Wray 2012). This suggests the typical design of cue\u2010elicited craving studies, that measure brief presentations of drug\u2010related images interspersed with neutral control images, identify immediate brain responses to drug cues, rather than craving per se. Video imagery of drug\u2010related activities provides contextually richer and more realistic cues that better model real\u2010world exposure and elicit strong craving responses (Childress et al. 1999; Tong, Bovbjerg, & Erblich 2007). Videos have been extensively used to follow psychophysiological responses to craving although this has been limited to box\u2010car on\u2010off fMRI designs through the lack of techniques or tradition for following blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) responses over minutes. We borrowed pharmaco\u2010MRI methods developed to follow and localize the action of drugs on the CNS, to follow the effect of sustained craving elicited by video cues, in hypothesized regions of interest. We reasoned that this approach could capitalize on the video mode of drug cue delivery, providing time course fMRI information for investigation of how psychological variables relate to brain response over time. We applied this approach in recently abstinent individuals with opioid dependence (OD), to better delineate brain responses related to the experience of craving over a period of cue exposure. We additionally investigated brain response for a period after cue exposure to gain insights into regions that may be involved in cognitive/behavioural control. Although videos have previously been used in fMRI studies of substance dependence, to our knowledge, dynamic brain responses to these cues have not previously been explored.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5531, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In recovering dependent individuals, brain responses to drug cues may reflect not only craving\u2010related activity but also attempts to control craving (Goldstein & Volkow 2011). This may explain why some participants in previous cue exposure studies have not reported significant overall changes in craving scores (Zijlstra et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2011). Time course information derived dynamically across video stimuli could help distinguish briefly induced craving and subsequent control at a neuronal level, thereby disambiguating distinct processes that may have been compounded in previous studies. We hypothesized that early development of craving would be associated with activation of amygdala, ventral striatum and ventral medial prefrontal regions involved in processing reward value and incentive motivation. In our treatment\u2010seeking sample, with long\u2010term goals of abstinence, we further hypothesized that response in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex would develop both during and after the video as subjective craving decreased, reflecting conscious control mechanisms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6617, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Methods and Materials", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6639, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Participants", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6652, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Opioid\u2010dependent individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a018)", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6690, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study was approved by the NHS Research Ethics Committee.

Preclinical findings demonstrate both the basolateral and central amygdala to be crucial for generating drug\u2010seeking responses to drug cues (Li et al. 2008; Buffalari & See 2010). Human fMRI studies similarly report amygdala activation in response to heroin cues (Langleben et al. 2008; Mei, Zhang, & Xiao 2010; Li et al. 2012; Langleben et al. 2014), and pharmacological agents used to manage OD attenuate both amygdala activation and craving (Langleben et al. 2008; Mei et al. 2010; Langleben et al. 2014).

Study design may also influence lateralisation, as the left amygdala is more commonly recruited in block designs rather than event\u2010related designs (Sergerie, Chochol, & Armony 2008), which may reflect different temporal dynamics (i.e. the right amygdala rapidly and automatically detects emotional stimuli, whilst the left amygdala engages in a more sustained evaluation) (Wright et al. 2001; Sergerie et al. 2008).

Cue\u2010elicited ACC response has previously been observed in cocaine\u2010dependent individuals viewing a short (<5\u00a0minutes) cocaine video (Wexler et al. 2001), and positive correlations between ACC activity and craving have been reported (Kuhn & Gallinat 2011; Li et al. 2012). However, traditional fMRI designs typically do not allow separation of the generation of craving from attempts to control craving (Goldstein & Volkow 2011). Here, our time course analysis showed that the dACC was not significantly recruited during the video when craving was at its peak, but was engaged after the end of the video whilst craving was declining. This suggests that the dACC is not involved in the generation of craving, but may be recruited as newly abstinent individuals consciously attempt to bring craving under control. Indeed, nicotine craving studies have demonstrated that the dACC is recruited when participants \u2018resist\u2019 (Brody et al. 2007), or cognitively reappraise (Zhao et al. 2012), craving. Of particular interest here, it has been demonstrated previously that opioid users show inefficient dACC activation during inhibitory control (Yucel et al. 2007), which may reduce their ability to resist craving, and increase risk of relapse following detoxification.

It is therefore considered an important substrate of substance dependence, and we hypothesized that we would observe ventral striatum responses to the drug cue video; however, no such response was observed. As we argued for the VmPFC, this may relate to reduced motivational salience of cues in actively treated individuals in combination with increased engagement of cognitive control processes that have been shown to inhibit both VmPFC and ventral striatal response to drug cues (Volkow et al. 2010). However, meta\u2010analyses of previous fMRI studies report ventral striatum responses to drug cues in both treatment and non\u2010treatment\u2010seeking cohorts (Chase et al. 2011). Ventral striatal response to craving cues has also been observed in another study of inpatient detoxified opioid\u2010dependent individuals (Li et al. 2012). However, it is important to consider the reasons why people are in treatment. Drug detoxification is often compulsory in some countries (Werb et al. 2016) or may be \u2018coerced\u2019 (e.g. treatment to reduce or avoid a prison sentence); therefore, being \u2018in treatment\u2019 does not necessarily equate to \u2018treatment seeking\u2019. Different responses to drug cues may be expected in those who have voluntarily chosen treatment compared with those who have been compelled or coerced to enter treatment programmes. Furthermore, the exact stage of treatment may influence brain response to drug cues. In the current study, although 39 participants enrolled, approximately 50 percent self\u2010discharged from the detoxification unit before the fourth week of the residential stay when scanning took place. Therefore, it remains possible that our group, tested during the last week of a voluntary, recovery focussed inpatient treatment programme, represents a distinct \u2018treatment\u2010seeking\u2019 population maximally motivated to maintain abstinence.

Half of the OD participants were still receiving the opioid withdrawal medication lofexidine, and one small study reported that high doses of lofexidine (2.4\u00a0mg twice daily) reduce craving (Sinha et al. 2007). However, lofexidine is not generally considered to suppress psychological cravings (Gish et al. 2010), and a much lower dose was administered to participants at the point of their participation in the present study (0.2\u00a0mg twice daily). Furthermore, differences in IQ and years of education between our groups may have influenced findings.

Amygdala response to drug cues may represent a persistent vulnerability to relapse within this cohort. By analysing brain and craving responses after the end of the craving video, we found increased dACC BOLD response only during the period of decreasing subjective craving. This suggests a role for the dACC in behavioural/cognitive control in recovering individuals following a period of cue\u2010induced craving. Persistent amygdala activation and craving in response to drug cues, together with inefficient dACC\u2010mediated control, may contribute to relapse following treatment. Promising cognitive and pharmacological treatments have been shown to reduce amygdala cue reactivity and increase dACC activity in both preclinical models and human tests of cognitive performance (Spence et al. 2005; Xue et al. 2012). Our time course\u2010based approach may represent an important biomarker for evaluating these treatments in dependent individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34047, "infons": {"section_type": "COMP_INT", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conflict of Interest", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34068, "infons": {"section_type": "COMP_INT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The authors declare no conflicts of interest", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34113, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Authors Contribution", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34134, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "RE was responsible for study concept.
