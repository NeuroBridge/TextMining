Here, investigations of individuals with and without heightened genetic or environmental risk for AD are needed to help disentangling resilience markers from vulnerability risk factors. Recent studies also introduced epigenetic mechanisms in AD, adding valuable information about modulating processes to the genotype-phenotype interaction. Those investigations should use appropriate study designs, such as comparisons of i) adolescent/young adult COAs with vs. without AD on their own or ii) adult AD patients vs. adult individuals without AD but with a positive family history of AD (e.g. first degree relatives of AD patients) vs. healthy individuals without familiar or own AD (as in the recent ongoing prospective cohort study \u201ce:Med SysMed Alcoholism\u201d), respectively. Clearly, findings testing neurobiological traits of vulnerability to AD (cf.) may give rise to new hypotheses and research questions, but caution is warranted that vulnerability markers are not simply the opposite of resilience. Rather, vulnerability demonstrates conditions and aberrations which exist before AD and may facilitate developing AD but are not only caused by e.g. neurotoxic alcohol effects. Resilience, on the other hand, refers to factors that promote good treatment outcome despite negative effects of long-term alcohol intake on neural structure and function.", "sentences": [],

Positive correlation between striatal D2 receptor availability and metabolism in OFC, ventral cingulate gyrus and PFC. D2 receptor and metabolism in left OFC was positively correlated to positive emotionality.\t \t\tProspective cohort study\tMRI/Volumetric data (CT, SA)\tnone\tnone\t14 days\tAD: mean 47.02 SD (10) Controls: mean 46.65 SD (12.37)\tN male = 47 N female = 12 (AD \u2194 controls)\tLower subcortical volumes in AD in putamen, NA, amygdala and hippocampus. No subcortical volume regain at FU. Cortical volume recovery driven by an increase in CT. More CT reduction and recovery in sulci compared to gyri.\t \t\tcross sectional\tfMRI/PPI\tn-back task\tCalifornia Child Q-Sort\tnone\tmean 20.2 SD (1.2)\tN male = 43 N female = 24 (parental alcoholism \u2194 no parental alcoholism)\tHigh resilience: neg. correlated to STN, pallidum activation; pos. correlated to lower levels of substance use, fewer alcohol problems and better working memory performance.\t \t\tcross sectional\tfMRI\tMID task\tDrinking and Drug History\tnone\tCOAs: mean 20.12 SD (1.2) control: mean 20.1 SD (1.3)\tn male = 24 n female = 16 (COAs \u2194 controls)\tResilience related to reduced ventral striatum activation in COAs.\t \tZakiniaeiz et al. 2016\tProspective cohort study\tfMRI/ICD\tIndividualized imagery paradigm\tnone\t90 days\tStudy 1 AD: mean 37.73 SD (1.16) Study 2 AD: mean 35.97 SE (0.08) Controls: mean 34.47 SE (1.55)\tStudy 1 N male = 35 N female = 10 Study 2 N male = 43 N female = 17\tAD showed decreased cingulate connectivity in responses to alcohol and stress cues compared to neutral cues. Weaker connectivity in ACC and MCC during neutral cue exposure related to longer abstinence. PCC connectivity during alcohol cues compared to stress cue conditions positively correlated to longer time to relapse. Cingulate connectivity significantly different between groups. AD showed reduced cingulate connectivity during alcohol and stress cues and increased cingulate connectivity during neutral cues. AD more similar to controls in cingulate connectivity had longer abstinence and better recovery.\t \t", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 54236, "infons": {"file": "T1.xml", "id": "T1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_footnote"}, "text": "MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; DTI = diffusion tensor imaging; AD = alcohol dependent; SD = standard deviation; \u2194 = versus; FA = fractional anisotropy; RD = radial diffusivity; PET = positron emission tomography; FHP = family history positive; FHN = family history negative; BPND = binding potential; FDG = 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose; fMRI = functional magnetic resonance imaging; PPI = psychophysiological interaction analysis; PFC = prefrontal cortex; ESPAD = european school survey project on alcohol and other drugs; SDQ = strengths and difficulties questionnaire; DAWBA = development and well-being assessment, LEQ = life events questionnaire; ACC = anterior cingulate cortex; DBM = deformation-based morphometry; LDH = lifetime drinking history; LD = light drinkers; OFC = orbitofrontal cortex; DLPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; SUD = substance use disorder; FEF = frontal eye field; SEF = supplementary eye field; GM = gray matter; WM = white matter; sAD = smoking alcohol dependent; nsAD = non-smoking alcohol dependent; BVTM = brief visuospatial memory test; MTL = medial temporal lobe; YSR = youth self-report; COA = children of alcoholics; VS = ventral striatum; pos. = positively; WAIS III = Wechsler adult intelligence scale; AMNART = American national adult reading test; BDNF = brain-derived neurotropic factor; ICMRGLC = regional cerebral glucose uptake; neg. = negative; c-DIS = computerized diagnostic interview schedule; FU = follow-up; CT = cortical thickness; STN = subthalamic nucleus; MID = monetary incentive delay; PCC = posterior cingulate gyrus; MCC = midcingulate cortex; ICD = intrinsic connectivity distribution", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
