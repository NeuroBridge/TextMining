The goal of this study was to prospectively investigate the spatial topography of drug-cue reactivity in a large set of individuals dependent on either cocaine, alcohol, or nicotine. Functional MRI data was acquired from 156 substance dependent individuals (55 cocaine, 53 alcohol, and 48 nicotine) as they performed a standardized drug-cue exposure task. Clusters of significant activation to drug-cues relative to neutral cues (\u2018hot spots\u2019) were isolated for each individual. K-means clustering was used to classify the spatial topography of the hotspots in the data set. The percentage of hotspots that would be reached at several distances (2\u20135\u2009cm) of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were calculated. One hundred and three participants had at least one cluster of significant frontal cortex activity (66%). K-means revealed 3 distinct clusters within the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), left inferior frontal gyrus/insula, right premotor cortex. For the group as a whole (and for alcohol users and nicotine users independently), medial prefrontal cortex (BA 10) was the location of the greatest number of hotspots. The frontal pole was cortical location closest to the largest percentage of hotspots.

The highest likelihood is the medial prefrontal cortex. When all significant hot spots were included in the analysis, 40% of these were in this MPFC/ACC cluster. This high prevalence is consistent with prior studies in the field. A meta-analysis of alcohol users, for example, evaluated 28 alcohol cue-reactivity studies. They demonstrated that among alcohol users alcohol cues consistently elicited activation in the ventral striatum, anterior cingulate and ventral medial prefrontal cortex. A similar meta-analysis of smoking studies evaluated 11 smoking cue-reactivity studies. They found that smoking cues reliably evoke larger fMRI responses than neutral cues in the visual system (consistent with Hanlon et al.), precuneus (consistent with Courtney et al 2014), cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and the dorsal striatum. The first and only meta-analysis to evaluate common and divergent patterns of cue-reactivity across alcohol, smoking and cocaine users demonstrated that activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and striatum was the common feature across drug groups. The compatibility of the results from the present study with these previous large metanalyses are encouraging, as one of the challenges of meta-analyses is that the investigators often do not have access to the raw data. Consequently, they rely upon the details reported by the individual study authors (who typically use slightly different paradigms, MRI scanning protocols, statistical processing packages, etc). In the present study we demonstrate that in a large cohort of individuals that performed a standardized drug cue reactivity paradigm on a given MRI scanner, using the same preprocessing pipeline, and a task that differed only in the drug-cue, there was consistent activity in the medial prefrontal cortex.
