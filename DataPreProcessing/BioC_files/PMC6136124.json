The brain has a very specific structural substrate providing a foundation for functional information; however, most studies ignore the very interesting and complex relationships between brain structure and brain function. While a variety of approaches have been used to study how brain structure informs function, the study of such relationships in living humans in most cases is limited to noninvasive approaches at the macroscopic scale. The use of data-driven approaches to link structure and function provides a tool which is especially important at the macroscopic scale at which we can study the human brain. This paper reviews data-driven approaches, with a focus on independent component analysis approaches, which leverage higher order statistics to link together macroscopic structural and functional MRI data. Such approaches provide the benefit of allowing us to identify links which do not necessarily correspond spatially (eg, structural changes in one region related to functional changes in other regions). They also provide a \u201cnetwork level\u201d perspective on the data, by enabling us to identify sets of brain regions that covary together. This also opens up the ability to evaluate both within and between network relationships. A variety of examples are presented, including several showing the potential of such approaches to inform us about mental illness, particularly about schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1710, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1723, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is a powerful tool which can provide us with detailed information about both brain structure and brain function. The use of high-resolution T1-weighted scans provides comprehensive anatomic information about brain tissue which can be used to estimate the volume of specific regions, cortical thickness, and networks of regions that covary together across individuals. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) gives information about white matter structure, and can be used to assess structural connectivity by using approaches to estimate various diffusion parameters including anisotropy as well as probabilistic tractography using tensor-based models and higher-order connectivity through multi-shell imaging and modeling with orientation distribution functions. Finally, functional MRI (fMRI) provides information about brain function via blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging over time and has been used to perform exquisite mapping of intrinsic connectivity networks.

It is also well known that structural sulcal/gyral boundaries definable at the macroscopic level do not necessarily correspond well to architectonic studies at the microscopic level. fMRI studies are improved if individualized functional boundaries are incorporated into the spatial normalization strategies. This complex synergy between structure and function increases the complexity of studying mental illnesses such as schizophrenia which are known to impact both structure and function. Figure 1 provides a simple illustration of these relationships; structure can be (and often is) claimed to be a fixed substrate onto which function operates. However, the reality is more complex as we know functional changes can also reshape brain structure, with such changes visible within days even at the macro level.

That is, schizophrenia impacts much of the brain, and there are numerous examples of structural and functional deficits associated with the illness. The use of data-driven methods can be particularly useful in this regard, as one can analyze the whole brain with an unbiased lens allowing for weak contributions from many different brain regions. Likewise, the relationship between function and structure can be elucidated with flexible analysis approaches such as independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is a type of blind source separation which allows for the estimation of signals from complex data sets with minimal assumptions on their specific form. In particular, with ICA the goal is to extract maximally independent sources from the data, typically written X = AS where X is the data, A is an estimated mixing matrix, and S are the estimated maximally independent sources. In practice, the widely used ICA algorithms such as infomax and fastICA often include two complementary constraints, independence (ie, the maps are maximally independent of one another) and sparsity (ie, the maps have a small number of region with high values), which when combined provide for relatively well-behaved and interpretable results (eg, a component can be interpreted as a brain network) as demonstrated by the extensive number of studies using this approach.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5767, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Data-driven approaches like ICA can be used to extract brain networks from sMRI, dMRI, and fMRI data and also link together brain structure and brain function.

In addition, hybrid approaches that combine the flexibility of data-driven approaches with the ability to focus on specific networks and/or regions are also quite powerful in this context. There are a large number of studies to date which have used data-driven approaches such as ICA to study neuropsychiatry and neurological brain disorders.

Using group ICA, one can extract networks that are functionally coherent, that is, identity networks that are showing correlated activity. The output from group ICA allows one to evaluate each network separately, essentially to evaluate the within-network connectivity, as well as to study the between-network connectivity, also called functional network connectivity (FNC; Figure 4). Importantly, one can also leverage single-subject spatial maps and timecourses that are estimated from the group ICA through a process called back-reconstruction. Group ICA thus allows estimation of changes in functional connectivity at the voxel level within specific networks, changes in the relationship between pairs of brain networks, as well as other information such as spectral response, and in the case of a task, modulation by task stimuli.
