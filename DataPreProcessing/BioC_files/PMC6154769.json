It includes the following dimensions: (i) illness awareness, (ii) attribution of symptoms to the illness, and (iii) awareness of need for treatment. Impaired clinical insight is one of the most common reasons for poor treatment adherence, and a strong association between impaired clinical insight and poorer outcome of the disorder has been shown. Clinical insight is separated from cognitive insight, which relates to patients' attributive metacognitive ability. Cognitive insight is defined as the ability to evaluate and reflect upon one's own aberrant views and interpretations. Clinical insight requires the ability to reflect upon oneself (i.e. cognitive insight), but also the abilities to inhibit one's own perspective, to take someone else's perspective and to switch between perspectives until the perspective is found that matches reality best. Consequently, it has been suggested that social cognitive functions such as self-reflectiveness and perspective taking, as well as cognitive functions such as cognitive (inhibitory) control and cognitive flexibility may play an important role in clinical insight. We assume that the ability to regulate emotions contributes to having good clinical insight, as patients should be able to regulate their emotional state in such a way that they can adapt adequately in order to cope with impaired functioning and negative stigma associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Better emotion regulation skills may also be associated with being more open to considering the possibility of having a mental disorder. The association between emotion regulation and insight has not been studied before. Results of an earlier study suggested that stigma resistance was associated with emotion regulation in patients with schizophrenia.

Emotion regulation refers to an individual's ability to manage their emotional states. Several emotion regulation strategies exist and individuals differ in their use of them. In this study, we focus on the two most-applied emotion regulation strategies, namely cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Cognitive reappraisal is antecedent-focused (i.e. focused on processes that precede an emotional response) and expressive suppression is response-focused (i.e., focused on response that is already under way). Several studies have shown that schizophrenia patients use reappraisal less frequently and suppression more frequently compared to healthy individuals, while other studies did not find significant differences.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5691, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "During cognitive reappraisal, individuals control negative emotions by changing their way of thinking. The neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal of emotional stimuli have been investigated extensively in healthy subjects using functional neuroimaging. These studies found increased activation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC; including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC), the dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) and the posterior prefrontal cortex), inferior parietal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and reduced activation of the amygdala, ventral striatum, insula and ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) during reappraisal (see and for meta-analyses). These studies suggest top-down control of the prefrontal cortex on areas involved in emotion processing (e.g. the amygdala). In schizophrenia, neuroimaging studies have reported hypo-activation of the VLPFC compared to healthy controls. During expressive suppression, emotion expression is inhibited. Two neuroimaging studies in healthy participants found increased activation of the DLPFC, VLPFC, and insula during suppression. Findings of these studies on amygdala activation were mixed, with one study finding increased and the other study finding decreased activation during suppression.

Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with impaired insight are less able to regulate their negative emotions through reappraisal and will make more use of suppression. Specifically, we expect a relationship between reappraisal and cognitive insight since reappraisal is a predominantly cognitive process. We hypothesize that patients with poorer cognitive insight show increased activation of prefrontal and emotional arousal-related areas, as well as more connectivity between prefrontal and emotional arousal-related areas suggesting increased mental effort and top-down control to exert cognitive reappraisal.

Only the regulation part differed between trials, and could be one of five conditions: attend neutral, attend negative, reappraise, suppress and increase. During View, participants were shown the emotional picture with the instruction \u2018view\u2019 asking participants to look at the picture. After that, instructions were presented on the screen below the picture instructing the participants how to regulate their emotional reaction to the picture (Regulation: attend, reappraise, suppress or increase). Instructions were in accordance with and, but translated into Dutch. During \u2018attend\u2019 the participants were asked to just look at the picture, while the participants were asked to regulate their emotions during \u2018reappraise\u2019, \u2018suppress\u2019 and \u2018increase\u2019. During \u2018reappraisal\u2019 the participant was instructed to reinterpret the picture in a way that decreases negative feelings. The instructions for \u2018suppression\u2019 asked the participant to suppress the expressive emotional reaction provoked by the picture. They were instructed that no one should be able to read their emotions from their face. The \u2018increase\u2019 condition entailed the opposite of the \u2018reappraise\u2019 condition, so participants had to increase the negative emotions caused by the stimulus.

For reappraisal, we did not find any significant associations between activation or connectivity and insight. A possible explanation for this could be that this study was conducted in a structured laboratory setting which does not resemble real life, as patients were explicitly cued and instructed to reappraise. This could result in patients being abler to regulate their emotions compared to real life, since in more complex social settings, cognitive control and working memory may be more challenged, especially in patients with impaired insight. For expressive suppression, we hypothesized that patients with poorer clinical insight would show less brain activation of relevant areas (i.e. DLPFC, VLPC and insula) during expressive suppression. We indeed found that patients with poorer ability to relabel symptoms showed less brain activation in the left striatum, thalamus and insula and the right insula and caudate during expressive suppression. In addition, they showed less brain activation in areas involved in visual processing of negative stimuli (i.e. left superior occipital gyrus and cuneus and right middle and superior occipital gyrus and cuneus). The latter is strengthened by the finding that connectivity between the midline medial frontal gyrus, an important area for execution of emotion regulation, and the right middle occipital gyrus, showed to be increased in patients with poorer clinical insight. Our results suggest that patients with poorer ability to relabel symptoms engage different neural pathways during expressive suppression, which are implicated in cognitive-emotional control and visual processing of negative stimuli, implying a role of emotion regulation in clinical insight. Decreased activation of the insula during suppression might imply decreased self-focus, as individuals with poorer ability to relabel symptoms might direct their attention less inward to monitor their expressions. In addition, less activation of areas involved in visual processing of negative stimuli could indicate that patients with poorer ability to relabel symptoms implicitly reduce processing of emotion-evoking aspects of negative stimuli during expressive suppression. Other studies showed attentional shifts and reduced viewing of negative stimuli during emotion regulation, even without instruction to do so. Reduction of negative affect by use of expressive suppression appeared to be as successful in patients with poorer insight, as we did not find a significant correlation between (clinical or cognitive) insight and negative affect rating after suppression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35633, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Other studies also found associations between clinical insight and brain activation of areas that were shown to be involved in expressive suppression in our study. Sapara and colleagues, for example, found that patients with poorer insight (based on Birchwood Insight Scale scores) showed less activation in the left putamen, extending to the caudate, insula and IFG, compared to patients with preserved insight during a self-monitoring task. They noted that these areas are known to be involved in self-monitoring, specifically in the appraisal and attribution of self-generated stimuli. In addition, an earlier study of our group found an association between poorer clinical insight (lower SAI-E subtotal scores) and less activation in the left anterior insula, among other areas, during a self-reflection task. Less insula activation was interpreted as weaker emotional and interoceptive response. It was suggested that insula activation may result from an emotional response evoked by self-reflection, which may fail to occur in patients with impaired insight in whom these self-reflective processes are hampered to begin with. Other studies have also suggested that the representation of interoceptive information mediated by the insula plays an important role in higher order processes such as self-awareness and insight. Lastly, Shad and colleagues found a correlation between unawareness of symptoms (as measured with the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder) and activation in the left frontal inferior operculum (including parts of the insula, caudate and putamen) and left lingual gyrus, as well as between misattribution of symptoms (SUMD) and activation of the left frontal inferior triangle (including parts of the insula), right putamen and left lingual gyrus during a self-awareness task. They noted that several studies have shown involvement of the basal ganglia in integrative and cognitive processes influencing not only sensory-motor control, but also different types of cognitive and limbic affective functions, which underlie complex and integrative processes such as self-awareness, introspective perspective of one's own self and consciousness. However, it is difficult to disentangle the neural substrate of impaired insight, as underlying (social) cognitive and emotional processes (and their neural substrates) are related, in addition to schizophrenia being a heterogeneous disorder.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38056, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "With regard to cognitive insight, we found that patients with poorer self-reflectiveness abilities had lower activation of brain systems subserving control and execution of emotion regulation (i.e. left and right pre- and postcentral gyrus and the left middle cingulate gyrus) during suppression. Few fMRI studies have studied the association between brain activation during a task and cognitive insight, and associations between higher self-reflection abilities or higher cognitive insight (composite index scores) and higher activation of prefrontal areas (VMPFC, VLPFC, DLPFC) has been found most frequently. No associations between cognitive insight and activation in the pre- and postcentral gyrus and middle cingulate gyrus have been found before. The midcingulate cortex (MCC) has been suggested to be involved in cognitive control and intentional motor control and selection, while the pre- and postcentral gyri have been associated with movement but also with motor imagery and task execution. also showed coactivation of the MCC with several emotion regulation areas such as the insula, VLPFC, SMA and thalamus suggesting a role of this area in emotion regulation. Our results could suggest less control and execution of suppression in patients with poorer self-reflectiveness. These results are in line with our suggestion that patients with poorer insight may implicitly reduce processing of emotion-evoking aspects of negative stimuli during expressive suppression and are therefore less involved in expressive suppression. Following this line of thought \u2013 the avoidance of emotion-evoking aspects of negative stimuli \u2013 is in line with the psychological denial model, which is one of several models attempting to explain the etiology of insight. The psychological denial model suggests that poor insight is caused by the use of denial as a coping strategy in order to reduce distress caused by stigma associated with diagnosis of schizophrenia. Patients who use denial as a coping strategy, therefore, may have impaired insight but suffer less distress as has been shown in several cross-sectional studies. We did not directly test whether poor insight is related to the use of denial as a coping strategy, however. No significant relationship was found between self-reflectiveness abilities and negative affect after suppression, suggesting that patients with poorer self-reflectiveness abilities were as successful in reducing negative affect. No significant relationships were found between the other SAI-subscale scores and activation or connectivity during emotion regulation. This is in line with the idea that insight is a multidimensional construct, in which different brain areas are involved in separate dimensions of insight. In addition, no significant relationships were found between activation or connectivity and the BCIS self-certainty score. Other studies investigating the association between insight and activation during tasks also found mixed results with regard to the BCIS composite index score and subscale scores. One study found significant associations with SR only, while another study found significant associations with both the composite index score as well as SR. No fMRI-studies found significant associations with the SC-subscale thus far.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41344, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We did not find significant correlations between insight and other variables such as demographic or clinical characteristics, self-reported use of suppression and reappraisal, and self-reported negative affect after correction for multiple testing. The lack of significant correlations between self-reported use of emotion regulation strategy and insight could be explained by our measure of emotion regulation strategy (i.e. ERQ), which is a relatively simple self-report questionnaire.

Second, antipsychotic medication may have influenced brain activation. However, several studies have shown that there is no common effect of antipsychotics on BOLD-signal. Also, a high percentage of patients with schizophrenia used antipsychotic medication in this study, which makes this group of participants a good representation of the whole patient population. Third, the ability to regulate emotions was difficult to monitor. The effectiveness of reduction of negative affect was measured with self-reported affect and neural indices in this study. Future studies should verify effectiveness of emotion regulation by measuring facial expression and/or physiological measures of emotional reactivity such as heart rate, skin conductance, pupil dilation and startle eye blink magnitude. Fourth, in this study, a late-cueing design was used in which the regulation instruction was presented 2\u202fs after stimulus presentation. Therefore, we did not find activation in the amygdala during regulation as this happened before. A design in which there is simultaneous presentation of the stimulus and instructions for regulation could be more sensitive to amygdala activation.
