Previous research utilising reward learning or anticipation paradigms has demonstrated cortical and subcortical abnormalities in people with psychosis, specifically in the prefrontal cortex, the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatum. In these paradigms, reward prediction errors attribute motivational salience to stimuli. However, little is known about possible abnormalities across different forms of salience processing in psychosis patients, and whether any such abnormalities involve the dopaminergic midbrain. The aim of our study was, therefore, to investigate possible alterations in psychosis in neural activity in response to various forms of salience: novelty, negative emotion, targetness (task-driven salience) and rareness/deviance. We studied 14 antipsychotic na\u00efve participants with first episode psychosis, and 37 healthy volunteers. During fMRI scanning, participants performed a visual oddball task containing these four forms of salience. Psychosis patients showed abnormally reduced signalling in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) for novelty, negative emotional salience and targetness; reduced striatal and occipital (lingual gyrus) signalling to novelty and negative emotional salience, reduced signalling in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex and parahippocamal gyrus to negative emotional salience, and reduced cerebellar signalling to novelty and negative emotional salience. Our results indicate alterations of several forms of salience processing in patients with psychosis in the midbrain SN/VTA, with additional subcortical and cortical regions also showing alterations in salience signalling, the exact pattern of alterations depending on the form of salience in question.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1990, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2003, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Salience is a property that enables a stimulus to attract attention, and to drive cognition and behaviour. It can be described as a product of matched/mismatched stimulus features and internal, driving factors of an individual, such as goals, beliefs and experiences at a particular point in time. Salience is a multifaceted concept, including different dimensions, such as reward and threat prediction, prediction error, novelty, emotional salience or rareness/deviance. The literature well describes the role of dopamine (DA) for reward prediction error, with neural signals originating in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA). However, DA neuron firing is not exclusive to reward prediction error, but has also been reported in response to non-rewarding unexpected events, such as aversive or alerting, as well as novel events, suggesting that DA release, at least in some contexts, reflects general salience.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2932, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In psychosis, abnormal salience processing secondary to dysregulation of the dopaminergic system\u2014described as the \u2018aberrant salience\u2019 hypothesis of psychosis\u2014has been linked to the formation and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. It has been suggested that aberrant salience attribution in psychosis is caused by faulty DA signalling in the striatum, possibly driven by dysregulation from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. In psychosis, there is increased synthesis and release of DA in the striatum, which is present even at the prodromal stages of the disease. Several studies reported reduced midbrain, striatal, and/or cortical processing of reward prediction errors and non-reward related prediction errors in psychosis. In our recent work, we documented meso-cortico-striatal prediction error deficits, involving midbrain, striatum and right lateral frontal cortex in medicated psychosis patients at different stages and in unmedicated first episode psychosis patients and patients at clinical risk for developing psychosis.

A recent study by Schott and colleagues reported alterations in a fronto-limbic novelty processing network in unmedicated (not necessarily first episode) patients with acute psychosis.

In a PET study, Taylor and colleagues showed impaired neural processing in the ventral striatum in response to emotional salient events in chronic and acute psychosis patients. However, results regarding processing alterations in the amygdala were unclear.

If dopaminergic signalling is generally compromised in psychosis, it then follows that there should be overlapping patterns of abnormal activation to various forms of salient stimuli in the dopaminergic midbrain and associated target regions in psychosis patients. Under an alternative account, salience processing may still be generally impaired in psychosis, but this may be secondary to dysfunction of diverse neural systems. In the current study, we, therefore, investigated brain responses in the SN/VTA and other target areas to four types of salience\u2014stimulus novelty, negative emotional salience, rareness/deviance (or \u2018contextual deviance\u2019), and targetness (task-driven attentional salience)\u2014in patients with early psychosis and healthy volunteers.

Participants\u2019 data (first-level analysis) were processed using the FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT). Functional images were realigned, motion corrected (MCFLIRT) and spatially smoothed with a 4\u2009mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. A high-pass filter was applied (120\u2009s cut-off). All images were registered to the whole-brain echo-planar image (EPI) (i.e., functional image with the whole-brain field of view), and then to the structural image of the corresponding participant (MPRAGE) and normalised to an MNI template, using linear registration with FSL FLIRT. The five explanatory variables (EVs) that we used were the onset times of the standard, target, emotional, novel and neutral pictures. They were modelled as 1\u2009s events and convolved with a canonical double-gamma response function. We added a temporal derivative to the model to take into account possible variations in the haemodynamic response function. To capture residual movement-related artefacts, six covariates were used as regressors of no interest (three rigid-body translations and three rotations resulting from realignment). We used four contrasts: target\u2013neutral, emotion\u2013neutral, novel\u2013neutral, and neutral\u2013standard. In the \u201csecond-level\u201d analysis, we averaged the four blocks of the task for each participant using FEAT with Fixed Effects. For estimation of group comparison (higher level, or \u201cthird level\u201d) statistics, we used permutation testing utilising the FSL randomise tool, with threshold-free-cluster enhancement, which enhances cluster-like structures but remains fundamentally a voxel-wise statistical testing method. We used 5000 permutations and we report results at p\u2009=\u20090.05 or less, family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons, using the variance smoothing option (3\u2009mm) as recommended for experiments with small to modest sample sizes, as is common in fMRI research.

Furthermore, for each contrast we defined a secondary analysis, with either one region, or two non-adjacent regions combined in a single mask. For novelty, we used a secondary region of interest mask composed of the striatum (using a hand-drawn mask, encompassing both associative and limbic striatum, but not sensorimotor striatum, based on operational criteria) and the right lateral frontal cortex (utilising a sphere, 10\u2009mm, centred at x\u2009=\u200950, y\u2009=\u200930, z\u2009=\u200928, based on our previous work).

These results are unconfounded by antipsychotic medication as we tested an antipsychotic na\u00efve patient sample. This study is first, to our knowledge, to present SN/VTA signalling alterations in psychosis in response to different forms of salience, all in absence of rewarding feedback. Our results, therefore, extend findings reporting midbrain and cortical abnormalities in response to reward prediction error signals in medicated and unmedicated psychosis patients at different stages of the disease, fronto-limbic connectivity alterations in response to novelty in acute, unmedicated psychosis patients and striatal abnormalities in response to emotional salience in chronic, medicated and a small sample of unmedicated acute psychosis patients.

These unusually salient representations may lead to the formation of hallucinations or generally altered perceptions. As a result, patients may construct delusional explanations in order to explain these altered perceptions. Abnormal salience attribution is present from early and even prodromal stages of the disease. Usually, this theory is investigated in the context of motivational salience using reward prediction paradims. Here, however, salience was investigated in the absence of the reward. For various forms of salience, the psychosis patient group showed significantly attenuated SN/VTA activation for the contrasts between salient and non-salient events. This impaired differentiation between salient and non-salient events could reflect dysregulated dopamine neuron activity, leading to the excessive attribution of salience to normally non-salient stimuli, and reducing salience to normally salient stimuli.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34052, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In healthy subjects, novelty identification is processed by a number of brain regions, including SN/VTA, striatum, parietal, and prefrontal cortices. Consistent with this, we observed group differences in the SN/VTA and the striatum in response to novelty. Our findings extend results of a study by Schott and colleagues; although, this study did not detect clear differences in the midbrain or striatum in psychosis, they found an increase in functional connectivity of the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex with the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus and the ventral striatum. Our study also demonstrates significantly reduced activation in response to negative emotional salience compared to controls in right amygdala, the SN/VTA and the striatum in psychosis patients compared to controls. This result is consistent with the literature indicating reduced arousal to emotional stimuli. Our study also supports findings of a PET study indicating tonic over-activation of the amygdala and impaired striatal signalling during emotional salience processing. Jabbi and colleagues reported increased dopaminergic releases in the amygdala and midbrain in response to emotional salience, which might be altered in psychosis. Our results, furthermore, reveal reduced activation in the thalamus of psychosis patients compared to healthy controls for negative emotional salience. The thalamus is a relay station of multiple neural connections and has dopaminergic synapses. Consistent with this and our findings, a study by Hadley and colleagues reported reduced connectivity between the VTA/midbrain and the thalamus in schizophrenia patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35695, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to reduced SN/VTA processing in response to novelty and negative emotional salience, we also found reduced signalling in response to targetness in patients. Therefore, our study is first to provide clear evidence for reduced SN/VTA processing in response to these different forms of non-motivational salience in psychosis. Together with the striatal findings of altered novelty and emotional salience signalling, the findings in the patients support the aberrant salience hypothesis for general (not just reward-related) salience dysfunction. As both the midbrain and the striatum are dopaminergic key regions, it also provides supporting (though not definitive) evidence for a dysregulated dopaminergic system during salience processing in psychosis. In healthy controls, Bunzeck and D\u00fczel reported significantly enhanced SN/VTA activation in response to novelty, and also positive, but not statistically significant, activation in response to negative emotional salience, providing supportive evidence for a differential activation of the SN/VTA in response to novelty. Using a larger sample size than previous studies and a slightly different regional specification used for the SN/VTA, we, however, find significant SN/VTA activation to novelty and negative emotional salience in controls. Our results, therefore, support the view of general processing of salience in the SN/VTA, including novelty, negative emotional salience and targetness. An account reconciling these results with those of Bunzeck and D\u00fczel, may be that SN/VTA is highly sensitive to novelty, but is also sensitive to (at least some) other forms of salience. On the other hand, we do note that the precise voxels within the SN/VTA that activate and/or show significant group differences to the different salient conditions do not overlap, though they are sometimes adjacent (see Supplementary Figure 9 and 10 for example). Furthermore, our focus of maximal group difference in novelty activation is slightly more rostral as compared to Bunzeck and D\u00fczel\u2019s findings of novelty associated activity in controls but still lies within the SN/VTA ROI as defined by Murty et al. Given this variation in precise location of voxel clusters within the SN/VTA ROI, combined with the spatial resolution of the current study, we cannot definitively determine within this region whether the exact same neurons activate to diverse or specific stimuli. However, future studies could employ higher resolution at higher field strengths, to address these questions.

A study by Gradin and colleagues reported dysfunctional connectivity between the salience network and the midbrain during a reward learning task leading to abnormal reward processing in schizophrenia patients.

Here, we would have rather predicted a negative correlation showing a decrease of SN/VTA activation with increased symptom scores, especially given the group difference that showed lower activation in the patient group as a whole. It is thought-provoking that in this small study, several forms of salience showed reduced activation across regions in the average patient, but greater activation associated with greater symptoms. One speculation is that reduced activation (between group results) could reflect a trait abnormality, and superimposed on this are state dysfunctions closely linked to symptom expression. However, symptom correlations with functional imaging have often yielded inconsistent results in schizophrenia research.
