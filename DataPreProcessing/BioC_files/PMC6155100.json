The heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and associated cognitive and behavioral deficits in patients has motivated a broad search for neurobiological underpinnings across different functional domains. Accordingly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on psychosis have used an extensive repertoire of paradigms, including resting state, working memory, episodic memory, language processing, emotional processing, motor control, and response inhibition among others. These studies have provided evidence that dysfunction in several brain regions, including prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, medial temporal cortex, cingulate cortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum may in some way mark risk for and/or expression of psychosis. Nevertheless, the patterns of altered brain function associated with SZ are not entirely consistent across studies. In part, this inconsistency is likely to reflect the fact that each study is designed to probe particular brain systems based on particular task features. The goal of the present study was to determine whether a more consistent functional imaging biomarker of psychosis risk will emerge using a strategy that explicitly assesses patterns of brain functioning across paradigms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3134, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several lines of evidence make the exploration of such a neural signature plausible. From a clinical perspective, although psychotic disorders present a diversity of phenotypes, similar symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thought and behavior are the core features that distinguish psychosis from other mental disorders. Thus, an intrinsic neural deficit that is closely related to these features may typify individuals with psychosis and with higher vulnerability to psychosis. From a neurobiological perspective, recent work has suggested that the brain possesses an intrinsic and state-independent functional architecture, and functional networks during different paradigms are shaped primarily by this \u201cstandard\u201d architecture and secondarily by paradigm-specific features. These findings raise the possibility that the neural alterations associated with psychosis may occur in relation to the \u201cstandard\u201d network architecture to a greater degree than the state-dependent networks. Further, despite the heterogeneity in results derived from different paradigms, the brain regions that are associated with psychosis highly overlap in the literature, suggesting the possibility that shared neural mechanisms underlie various functional states.

Using principal component analysis (PCA) combined with connectome-wide network-based statistics (NBS), we sought to delineate network-level changes in the human functional connectome that precede conversion to psychosis in a sample of 182 subjects at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis (among whom 19 cases later converted to full psychosis during follow-up) and 120 healthy controls drawn from the second phase of the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS-2) consortium.

Here we termed these values as measures of \u201cCross-paradigm connectivity\u201d, in order to differentiate them from \u201cfunctional connectivity\u201d in a more typical context.

To mitigate these confounding influences, we included age, sex, IQ, site, mean frame-wise displacement (FD) across all paradigms, and antipsychotic dosage as nuisance regressors in the NBS analysis. After controlling for these variables, we observed a highly significant group effect on a connected network including a total of 84 edges linking pairs of 62 nodes covering multiple brain regions in the cerebellum, thalamus, and cerebral cortex (PFWE\u2009=\u20090.005 from 10,000 permutations, Fig.\u00a02a).

The same group effect was again identified (P\u2009=\u20090.016, one-way ANCOVA, Supplementary Fig\u00a03B), which was again driven by the differences between the SZ group and the HC group (PBonferroni\u2009=\u20090.043, post-hoc t-test) but not between the other groups (PBonferroni\u2009>\u20090.06, post-hoc t-test).

This \u201ctrait-like\u201d abnormality involves dysconnectivity between multiple cerebral cortical regions, thalamus, and cerebellum. The affected cortical regions correspond well to those that have been frequently reported as associated with SZ in the literature, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, medial temporal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex. The associations of these regions with psychosis have been found both anatomically and functionally, including measurements such as cortical thickness, cortical volume, brain activation and connectivity during tasks and rest, and low-frequency brain oscillations, suggesting that the changes in these regions are robust and may be consistently present across multiple imaging modalities. Our study extends these previous results by showing the existence of a state-independent network anomaly, suggesting that circumscribed regional alterations reported previously may partly belong to a broader and intrinsic neural network change in psychosis.

Specifically, the frontoparietal and attentional networks are critical cognitive control systems in humans and have been implicated in the cognitive deficits in patients with psychosis, particularly SZ. The default-mode network is a brain system that is activated during rest but deactivated during attention-demanding tasks. The failure to deactivate this network during active tasks and the exaggeration of connectivity in this network during resting state have been repeatedly reported in the psychosis state, which may relate to excessive internally focused thoughts and self-reference during rest and lack of sufficient suppression of these thoughts during task. The dysfunction in primary functional systems such as the visual and auditory networks may contribute to hallucination symptoms in psychotic disorders, and the altered connectivity between thalamus and the sensorimotor network may reflect a subcortical gating deficit which leads to abnormal subcortical sensory inputs to the cortex. Together, the conjoint involvement of these systems in the identified network change suggests aberrant information integration or communication between multiple primary and higher-order systems as a core feature of psychosis. The effects of each system may summate and/or interact with each other in creating risk for overt illness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28646, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our findings appear to be broadly consistent with the \u201ccognitive dysmetria\u201d theory of SZ. Initially proposed by Nancy Andreasen and colleagues, this theory posits that patients with SZ are characterized by changes in a key neural circuit, namely, the cerebello\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical circuitry. Dysfunction in this circuitry leads to an impairment in the synchrony or coordination of mental processes. This impaired mental coordination is considered as the fundamental deficit in SZ that further accounts for various clinical symptoms. This theory is supported by prior neuroimaging studies. For example, altered cerebellar and prefrontal activations have been reported during a wide range of cognitive tasks. In addition, abnormal thalamic\u2013cortical and cerebellar\u2013cortical functional connectivity have been consistently observed in populations with psychosis, particularly SZ. These alterations can further be found before the onset of psychosis in subjects at high risk, suggesting a trait anomaly that possibly relates to vulnerability to psychotic disorders. Apart from these functional findings, structural changes in thalamus, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex are also evident in SZ and have been summarized in several meta- or mega-analysis studies. Highly consistent with these prior findings, our research further demonstrates that the dysfunction of the cerebello\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical circuitry may be a fundamental state-independent neural trait that predicts and characterizes psychosis, thereby highlighting the role of this circuitry in the neuropathology and psychopathology of SZ. These findings overall may offer a unified framework to explain the complex and heterogeneous behavioral and cognitive phenotypes in psychotic disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30388, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The hyperconnectivity in the identified network is also broadly consistent with the \u201cN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction\u201d hypothesis of SZ. Reduced global NMDAR expression and activity have long been observed in patients with SZ, possibly due to underlying genetic and environmental risk factors. These NMDAR deficits would downward regulate the function of cortical parvalbumin-containing \u03b3-amino-butyric acid (GABA) interneurons, leading to reduced recurrent inhibition of the pyramidal glutamatergic neurons, which in turn, cause exaggerated cortical gamma oscillations and functional connectivity in patients. As a result, the hyperconnectivity in the cerebello\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical circuitry in our study may reflect a downstream phenomenon of NMDAR functional deficits, which occurs prior to the onset of psychosis and maintains during the full psychosis state. Another interpretation, in line with the \u201ccognitive dysmetria\u201d theory, relates to the need for increased cognitive effort in SZ patients, as well as in subjects at CHR. A large body of work has pointed to the role of cerebellum as a general \u201cerror detection and correction\u201d center in the brain, which receives, integrates, and computes error information regarding both movement and thought from the cerebral cortex and provides adaptive feedback via the cerebello\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical circuitry. In parallel with this notion, the hyperconnectivity in this circuitry may reflect a compensatory effect induced by excessive error input from the upstream cerebral cortex.

Although we sought to control these factors by directly modeling these variables in our analyses and by verifying results in subsamples matched on these features, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that our findings may to certain degree be influenced by other factors that we have not measured. Second, despite the fact that our study was performed on one of the largest psychosis CHR fMRI sample to date, the number of converters in our NAPLS-2 sample was relatively small. Therefore, future replications are encouraged in larger cohorts with more data available for converters. Third, all patients recruited in the CNP cohort were chronic patients.
