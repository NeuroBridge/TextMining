However, it is unknown whether dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) are expressed in the human retina. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have observed significant uptake of the D3R-preferring agonist radiotracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO into the retina of humans in vivo. This led us to examine whether [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the retina was quantifiable using reference tissue methods and if D3R are expressed in human post-mortem retinal tissue. [11C]-(+)-PHNO data from 49 healthy controls (mean age: 39.96 \u00b1 14.36; 16 female) and 12 antipsychotic-na\u00efve patients with schizophrenia (mean age: 25.75 \u00b1 6.25; 4 female) were analyzed. We observed no differences in [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the retina between first-episode, drug-na\u00efve patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Post-mortem retinal tissues from four healthy persons (mean age: 59.75 \u00b1 9.11; 2 female) and four patients with schizophrenia (mean age: 54 \u00b1 17.11; 2 female) were analyzed using a targeted mass spectrometry technique: parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we confirmed that D3R are expressed in human retinal tissue ex vivo. Notably, there was far greater expression of D2R relative to D3R in the healthy human retina (~12:1). Moreover, PRM analysis revealed reduced D2R, but not D3R, expression in the retinas of non-first episode patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. We confirm that D3R are expressed in the human retina. Future studies are needed to determine what proportion of the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in the human retina in vivo is due to binding to D3R versus D2R. Knowledge that both D2R and D3R are expressed in the human retina, and potentially quantifiable in vivo using [11C]-(+)-PHNO, poses new research avenues for better understanding the role of retinal dopamine in human vision.

Briefly, [11C]-propionyl chloride was reacted with 9-hydroxynaph-thoxazine to generate a [11C]-amide. This was subsequently reduced by lithium aluminium hydride. Purification by HPLC and formulation gave radio-chemically pure [11C]-(+)-PHNO as a sterile, pyrogen-free solution. PET images were acquired using a high-resolution head-dedicated PET camera system (CPS-HRRT; Siemens Molecular Imaging, USA). The CPS-HRRT measures radioactivity in 207 brain slices, each with a thickness of 1.2 mm. The in-plane resolution was approximately 2.8 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). Notably, significant [11C]-(+)-PHNO uptake into the retina could not be observed on scans collected using a high-resolution PET CT, Siemens-Biograph HiRez XVI (Siemens Molecular Imaging, Knoxville, TN, USA) operating in 3D mode with an in-plane resolution of approximately 4.6 mm FWHM (almost half the resolution of the CPS-HRRT). Thus, PET camera systems of ~2.8 mm FWHM or better are likely required to have the appropriate resolution to image [11C]-(+)-PHNO uptake into the retina. Transmission scans were acquired using a 137Cs (T1/2=30.2 yr, E=662 KeV) single photon point source to provide attenuation correction, and the emission data were acquired in list mode. The raw data were reconstructed by filtered-back projection and the emission data were re-binned into a series of 3D sonograms. Scanning time was 90-min in length, wherein 30 frames were defined: 1 to 15 of 1-min duration and 16 to 30 of 5-min duration. A custom-fitted thermoplastic mask (Tru-Scan Imaging, Annapolis) was created for each subject and used with a head fixation system during PET scans to reduce movement during the acquisition. [11C]-(+)-PHNO was injected as a bolus followed by a flush of 2 mL saline into an intravenous line placed in an antecubital vein. The mean radioactivity dose was 9.38(\u00b11.34)mCi, with a specific activity of 1160.82(\u00b1401.58)mCi/\u00b5mol, an injected mass of 2.07(\u00b10.46)\u00b5g, and an injected mass per kilogram of 0.03(\u00b10.008)\u00b5g/Kg.

For the first approach (termed \u201cmanual\u201d), retina ROIs were drawn manually on each subjects averaged dynamic [11C]-(+)-PHNO image in native-space (on every slice where the retina could be observed), employing previous PET guidelines (See Fig. 2). These manually drawn ROIs were then used to extract time activity curves from each subjects' dynamic PET image in native-space (See Fig. 3). This was done with reference to each subjects co-registered T1-weighted MRI image, to confirm the placement of the retina ROIs. The co-registration of each subjects MRI to PET space was done using the normalized mutual information algorithm as implemented in SPM2 (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The TACs from the manually drawn retina ROIs were analyzed using both the Simplified Reference Tissue Method (SRTM) and Ichise's Multilinear Reference Tissue Model (MRTM), both of which have been validated for use with [11C]-(+)-PHNO. For both models, the cerebellum was used as the reference region to derive a quantitative estimate of binding \u2013 binding potential relative to the non-displaceable compartment (BPND) \u2013 as defined by the consensus nomenclature for in vivo imaging of reversibly binding radioligands. It has been noted for in vivo human studies with [11C]-(+)-PHNO that there is a small displaceable signal in cerebellum (BPND=~0.4) representing binding to D3R in cerebellar lobes IX and X. Thus, while we have done our best to exclude lobes IX and X in our cerebellar ROI, using the cerebellum as the reference region with [11C]-(+)-PHNO may result in some underestimation of BPND at D3R. Moreover, we recognize that use of the SRTM and MRTM is predicated on the assumption that blood flow into and out of the target and reference regions are similar. This assumption may not be true for both the blood-brain barrier (cerebellar reference region) and the retina-brain barrier (retina target region), thus biasing our estimate of BPND. This poses a limitation in quantification which can only be avoided using arterial sampling of [11C]-(+)-PHNO, which is both invasive and costly. For the second approach (termed \u201cautomated\u201d), the basis function implementation of the SRTM was applied to the dynamic PET images to generate parametric voxel-wise BPND maps using PMOD (v2.7, PMOD Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). These images were spatially normalized into MNI brain space by Nearest Neighbour Interpolation with a voxel size fixed in 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm3 using SPM2. Regional BPND estimates were then derived from a manually drawn retina ROI defined in MNI space. The drawing of this ROI was aided by superimposing the average of the parametric voxel-wise BPND maps of all the subjects onto an MNI template.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12192, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "2.5.

Given that D2R expression in the retina is several orders of magnitude higher than D3R expression, it is possible that zero percent of the uptake in the retina is due to [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding to D3R. However, it is important to note that since [11C]-(+)-PHNO has ~25- to 45-fold greater selectivity for D3R versus D2R in vivo it is possible that the majority of the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in a brain region can be attributable to D3R, despite having greater levels of D2R expressed therein. For example, in the substantia nigra it can be estimated ex vivo that there is roughly 3- to 4-times greater D2R expression compared to D3R. However, in vivo practically 100% of the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in the substantia nigra is due to binding to D3R. Unfortunately, without a blocking study employing a highly D3R-prefering antagonist, we are currently unable to estimate what proportion of the [11C]-(+)-PHNO signal in the retina, if any, is due to binding to D3R. Moreover, we could only observe significant uptake of [11C]-(+)-PHNO on our highest resolution PET camera \u2013 the HRRT, not the Siemens Biograph HiRez PETCT. Unfortunately, previously published D3R blocking studies with [11C]-(+)-PHNO aquired scans using a Siemens Biograph HiRez PETCT (with Truepoint Gantry, 3D-mode). Thus, significant uptake into the retina could also not be observed on these scans (personal communication, Dr. Graham Searle, April 17, 2018). Thus, future [11C]-(+)-PHNO blocking studies \u2013 acquired on the HRRT and employing highly selective D3R-preferring antagonists \u2013 are required to determine whether [11C]-(+)-PHNO is binding to retinal D3R and/or D2R in vivo.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24975, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Collectively, our data also suggests that both D2R and D3R may be reduced in older, treated patients with schizophrenia. However, this may not be the case in first-episode, drug-na\u00efve patients. This appears prima facie consistent with evidence that DA receptor blockade by antipsychotics may cause degenerative retinopathies in patients with schizophrenia. Reductions in the retinal nerve fiber layer, macula, ganglion cell layer, and the inner plexiform layer is present in chronically treated patients with schizophrenia \u2013 although this has not been observed in all studies. In this regard, it is worth noting that thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer and outer retina layers has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal degeneration. Thus, it will be important to elucidate the relationship between D2/3R expression and structural integrity of the retina across various neuropsychiatric diseases. However, it is currently unclear how chronic antipsychotic exposure affects D2R and D3R expression in retina, and in turn visual functioning. For example, while several studies have demonstrated contrast sensitivity deficits in patients with schizophrenia, reports on the effects of antipsychotics on contrast sensitivity have been mixed. Some studies report abnormally low contrast sensitivity in unmedicated patients relative to medicated patients, while others report abnormally high baseline sensitivity which is reduced by short-term antipsychotic treatment. Further in vivo and ex vivo studies are required to examine the relationships between antipsychotic exposure on D2/3R expression and contrast sensitivity in patients with schizophrenia. While these aspects could not be examined in our current investigation, we believe this work marks as a first step towards elucidating this kind of information in the future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26860, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given that dopaminergic functioning in the retina may play diverse roles besides light adaptation, such as contributing to the development of myopia, it will be important to determine whether deficits in visual/retinal functioning in schizophrenia are inherent to the pathophysiology of the disease, or related to chronic D2/3R blockade by antipsychotics. For example, it has been well documented that the adverse ocular effects of chlorpromazine include miosis, blurred vision (caused by paralysis of accommodation), pigmentary changes in the retina, attenuation of retinal vessels, and optic nerve pallor. Moreover, given that loss of retinal DA has been observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, it will be important to determine whether D3R expression is altered in vivo and ex vivo, and how this may relate to visual functioning in these patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27718, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In contrast, evidence suggest that agonism of both DA D1 receptors (D1R) and D2R may be neuroprotective and a potentially effective intervention for ischemic or degenerative disorders in the retina and optic nerve. Notably, D3R agonism has been suggested to mediate neuroprotective effects on striatal DA neurons; although pro-cognitive effects of D3R antagonists in general has also been suggested. Since D1R and D3R form heterodimers in the striatum, it will be important to determine, i) whether D1R and D3R form heterodimers in the retina, and, ii) whether selective D3R agonism can mediate neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration in the retina. To add to this complexity, it has been well established that D2R expression decreases with age in the striatum \u2013 even in patients with schizophrenia \u2013 while D3R expression may increase with age. Larger in vivo and ex vivo studies are required to determine whether or not D3R increases, while D2R decreases, with age in the retina, similar to what has been proposed for the striatum.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28761, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several limitations with the current investigation. First, our PET analysis was retrospective. Thus, we did not acquire information about visual/retinal functioning in our participants. This important information can be acquired by future prospective [11C]-(+)-PHNO studies. Notably, both our first-episode sample and our post-mortem retina samples were relatively small. While both of these samples are difficult to recruit/obtain, it will be important for future studies to employ larger samples in order to be sufficiently powered to detect important associations between retinal D2/3R availability and clinical/cognitive variables. Moreover, future [11C]-(+)-PHNO studies examining the retina should recruit a patient group with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder, to compare with first-episode and healthy controls. Second, in quantifying [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND in the retina we employed a reference tissue model, which requires several assumptions to be met between the reference and target tissue (i.e., the retina and cerebellum). Thus, it will be important to further validate our quantification of BPND in the retina using arterial sampling. This in turn would help overcome any potential issues regarding underestimation of binding to D3R in the retina due to specific binding to D3R in the cerebellum. Third, the characterization of our participants in the post-mortem retina sample was incomplete. Namely, information about history of psychotic symptoms, history of antipsychotic drug usage, and cause of death was unavailable. Fourth, our retina tissue samples were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. It will be important to attempt to replicate our findings using unfixed, fresh tissue. Fifth, it will be important to determine where, and on which cell types, D3R are expressed in the human retina. However, this knowledge may be contingent upon future advances in the development of D3R selective antibodies and radioligands. Finally, due to limitations in radiosynthesis methods, all [11C]-(+)-PHNO scans are acquired under non-tracer conditions. Specifically, tracer conditions (less than 10% D3R occupancy by (+)-PHNO) would require an injected mass of 4.5 ng/kg, or 0.3 \u00b5g of (+)-PHNO in a 70 kg person. Thus, given non-tracer conditions, the signal from D3R blockade may be underestimated and physiological side-effects from tracer injection may occur. Notably, it has been reported that a 40 ng/kg mass dose of [11C]-(+)-PHNO is associated with 50% occupancy of D3R. In our current investigation, the average injected mass was 30 ng/kg. Thus, our [11C]-(+)-PHNO scans were also conducted under non-tracer conditions, likely resulting in significant occupancy of D3R (\u226450%). While this is a currently unavoidable limitation of [11C]-(+)-PHNO studies, none of the participants in this report experienced physiological side-effects (i.e. nausea or vomiting) in response to the injection of [11C]-(+)-PHNO. It is currently unclear what makes certain participants more susceptible to experiencing physiological side-effects in response to [11C]-(+)-PHNO injection, even at relatively lower reported averaged injected masses with constant infusion.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31971, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The demonstration of D3R expression in the human retina, and the potential to quantify retinal D3R availability in vivo with [11C]-(+)-PHNO, opens several new avenues of inquiry for elucidating the role of retinal DA in visual processing, in health and disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32233, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32256, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Financial disclosures", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32278, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The authors declare no conflicts of interest with regards to this work.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32350, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Appendix A.
