In the short term, synaptic dopamine levels and glutamate transmission are altered. In the long term, a reduction in neural activity occurs between certain brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and hippocampus. Abstinent cocaine users show reduced interhemispheric functional connectivity in the lateral PFC, medial premotor, and lateral parietal cortices, whereas relapsed cocaine users exhibit reduced connectivity between the corticomedial amygdala and ventromedial and rostral anterior cingulate cortices. Although such studies in humans generate important insights, their cross-sectional nature and comparison to other individuals as controls precludes measuring baseline brain connectivity before cocaine use. Also, studies on human cocaine users may have other caveats, such as polydrug use, incorrect recall of drug use or amount, differences in duration of use, relapse, or abstinence. Such variations may confound some interpretations about the effects of cocaine on brain structures. Also, as no baseline data were obtained, there is a possibility that aberrant connectivity patterns do not result from cocaine use, rather, they could represent an earlier neurodevelopmental defect that contributed to the onset of the maladaptive behavior. As it is unlikely that human studies will include a baseline measurement before cocaine exposure, it is useful to study animal models to determine the adverse effects of cocaine use on brain structure. However, only one previous publication described changes in functional connectivity between a baseline measurement and one month of abstinence following cocaine exposure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1951, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In their eNeuro publication, compared changes in functional connectivity in the rat brain between a baseline measurement and two time points of abstinence following cocaine exposure.
