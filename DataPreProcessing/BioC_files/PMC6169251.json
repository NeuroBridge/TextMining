To establish which of those mechanisms are actually involved in the mediation of AVH, we developed a novel method to analyze functional MRI data, which allows for the detection of the full network of mutually interacting brain states, and the identification of those states that are relevant to the mediation of AVH, while applying a minimum number of preconceived assumptions. This method is comparable to the draining of a pond to lay bare the full ecosystem that affects the presence of a particular fish species. We used this model to analyze the fMRI data of 85 psychotic patients experiencing AVH. The data were decomposed into 98 independent components (ICs) representing all major functions active in the brain during scanning. ICs involved in mediating AVH were identified by associating their time series with the hallucination time series as provided by subjects within the scanner. Using graph theory, a network of interacting ICs was created, which was clustered into IC modules. We used causal reasoning software to determine the direction of links in this network, and discover the chain of events that leads to the conscious experience of hallucinations. Hallucinatory activity was linked to three of the seven IC clusters and 11 of the 98 ICs. ICs with the most influential roles in producing AVH-related activity were those within the so-called salience network (comprising the anterior cingulate gyrus, right insula, Broca's homologue, premotor cortex, and supramarginal gyrus). Broca's area and the cerebellar regions were significantly, but more distantly involved in the mediation of AVH. These results support the notion that AVH are largely mediated by the salience network. We therefore propose that the mediation of AVH in the context of schizophrenia spectrum disorders involves the attribution of an excess of negative salience by anterior-cingulate areas to linguistic input from Broca's right homologue, followed by subsequent processing errors in areas further \u2018downstream\u2019 the causal chain of events.

They have been the object of extensive neuroimaging research over the last 20\u202fyears and various hypotheses have been proposed concerning their mediation. As recently summarized by Curcic-Blake et al., the four major hypotheses involve: i) memory intrusion into language processing, ii) disrupted self-monitoring of inner speech, iii) aberrant cerebral lateralization, and iv) unbalanced top-down and bottom-up processing. As all four models overlap somewhat with respect to the brain regions involved, hybrid models for AVH postulate an overflow of default-mode-network-derived information into sensory association cortices or into central executive networks (CEN), with the ensuing intrusions of these networks being falsely attributed to an external source. In the \u2018triple network model\u2019 it is hypothesized that such imbalances between the default-mode network (DMN) and CEN are mediated by a disrupted function of the salience network (SN) when the latter fails to attribute appropriate salience to input from resting-state and active-state (central executive) modi. The triple network model has been studied by Manoliu et al., where they find decreased activity of the right anterior insula to be associated with increased connectivity between the DMN and CEN, as well as hallucination severity. Alternatively, intrusions into CENs are thought to derive from unstable neural networks at a lower spatiotemporal level that erratically switch between their high-frequency active state and their low-frequency resting state.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4759, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Functional MRI studies have reported that hallucination-related brain activity precedes the conscious experience of hallucinations by as much as nine seconds, which is way before subjects become conscious of the hallucination. The experience of hallucinations therefore is thought to depend on a chain of neural events that precedes it. In a recent study by Lefebvre et al., examination of the triple network model is elaborated by including the hippocampus in their hypothesis and they focus on transitions between different phases surrounding the hallucinatory state. Evidence was found that increased hippocampal input to the SN is involved in switching to a hallucinatory state. Notwithstanding, the nature of the causal chain of events has so far remained largely unclear, since current methods of functional imaging were limited in their ability to examine this chain of events. Most fMRI studies have used strongly model-based methods to identify brain activity, which involves searching the brain for specific patterns of interest. As the detection of hallucinations in fMRI studies is especially challenging due to their unprompted occurrence in subjects, this often requires strongly specified models to obtain statistical power; or, in the case of data-driven studies, a selective use of data (components of interest). Such approaches can be compared to fishing with a matched spinner for one particular type of fish, which is nonetheless part of a complex ecosystem. Thus, model-based methods are confirmatory methods, which provide information on expected patterns, but these should be complemented by exploratory methods that allow for the discovery of unexpected (yet relevant) findings. In the fishing analogy, we would ideally want to employ a method that allows us to drain the pond without losing important species (e.g. noise reduction) to uncover the entire ecosystem (all neural events within the brain), after which we can select all species (neural events) that affect the presence of our main fish of interest (i.e. neural activity that is directly related to the conscious experience of AVH).

The first step of this process involved training. To optimize FIX for the fMRI PRESTO task, we used a subset consisting of the first 33 participants (recruited from an alphabetically arranged list) for hand-training of the classifier. Thus subject-level independent components (IC) from the independent-component analysis (ICA) in FSL were assessed with regard to temporal and spatial characteristics by two raters from our study group and one external rater, all of whom scored the results either as \u2018signal\u2019 or \u2018noise\u2019.

Most problems regarding the inference of causal directions in fMRI data can be overcome using these techniques, which have been tested on simulated fMRI data showing \u226595% accuracy. Essential to this approach is to i) start by applying a model-selection algorithm to reduce the number of links, then ii) create an undirected sparse graph, and, during the next stage, iii) use non-gaussian information in the skeleton graph to estimate causal directions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16615, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "First, to establish links between the various ICs, single-subject time courses were reconstructed by regressing group-spatial maps into each subject's 4D dataset. Next, the time courses of the 98 individual ICs were concatenated (98 ICs with 85\u202f\u00d7\u202f794 time points) to calculate group-level covariance matrices. This yielded a fully saturated network with 98\u202f\u00d7\u202f98 links, even though some correlations were weak. Secondly, we used EBIC-glasso (Extended Bayesian Information Criterion, graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), as implemented in the R-package qgraph (psychosystems.org), to perform initial model selection. EBIC-glasso is a data-driven method that employs a measure of information conservation (the EBIC) to optimally converge onto a network solution that possesses a high sparsity, but still succeeds in properly explaining the data. Glasso is a regularization technique for fast estimations of optimal models in large networks. The basis for these estimations is a saturated partial correlation matrix where spurious connections are controlled for by means of a tuning parameter \u03bb (lambda) for the penalization of the maximum likelihood estimation. It thus creates 100 network solutions, ranging from fully saturated to fully disconnected. From this range of networks, the graph with an optimal solution of sparsity while still representing the data (i.e., the EBIC score) was selected. Covariance-based methods using regularization techniques are accurate in estimating the presence of network connections across a range of fMRI conditions. EBIC scores have been used successfully in fMRI studies that aimed to obtain sparse network models while investigating limited sets of nodes (e.g., regions of interest, ROIs). The hyperparameter \u03b3 (gamma) was set to a default of 0.5, which produces optimal solutions in most simulated datasets. Third, the Linear Non-Gaussian Orientation, Fixed Structure (LOFS) algorithm was used to estimate the direction of links with the aid of the R3 rule. LOFS uses rules that (like the LiNGAM algorithm) infer orientation in a linear, non-Gaussian system, while orienting links in a pairwise manner, without reference to the additional context in the graph. Effective connectivity is established by estimating the model with the highest non-gaussianity of the error term. We estimated the degree of non-gaussianity by using Anderson-Darling scores. The R3 rule was chosen for its conservative character in appointing causal links in combination with high accuracy. Links between functional networks are expected to be reciprocal and, as such, we did not want to force direction, and only attain dominant directions of influence.

The BOLD responses coinciding with AVH were modeled by a boxcar based on the within-scanner balloon presses, which was subsequently convolved with a single gamma function without post-stimulus undershoot to model the hemodynamic response.

Within the IC network, we identified seven modules, together covering 97 of the 98 ICs (for summary slides of all ICs, see Supplementary Materials, Fig. 5). To establish the role of ICs in the flow of information throughout the network, hubs were identified and a network graph was constructed (Fig. 2). In the network graph, nodes were automatically assigned coordinates based on a force-directed layout algorithm that treats nodes as positive charges that repulse each other, while being constrained by their links (Gephi 0.9.1, gephi.org). Permutation tests revealed that, of the 98 ICs, 18 had significant associations with AVH-related balloon presses as recorded within the scanner, of which 11 had positive betas. These 11 ICs, which synchronized with balloon presses, functioned as the anchor points for the interpretation of our data. The ICs that activated or deactivated in relation to AVH clustered together within specific modules. The betweenness-centrality measure indicated ICs with a disproportional influence on information transfer throughout the whole network. Thus, ICs 3, 5, 7, 46, 54, 58, 76, 93, and 97 were identified as interconnecting hubs, whereas ICs 9, 11, 13, 14, 39, 50 were identified as tributaries in the AVH-related circuit.

Among them, three \u2018executive\u2019 fronto-parietal ICs were discernible, of which two were more lateralized (IC7, IC3), and one more balanced (IC13), which we assume to represent subdivided components of the CEN. The right-sided CEN (IC7) and the left-sided CEN (IC3) appeared to be interconnecting hubs. Additionally, we found several \u2018cognitive\u2019 ICs involving language production (IC28, IC38), working memory, self-referential processing, task coordination (IC38), and motor planning (IC33); of note, these may also be involved in other cognitive functions. This module also contained two ICs (IC28, IC59) that together form the salience network (SN). The SN is involved in risk prediction (i.e., the chance of reward), based on information streams of the highest level of integration (i.e., combined emotional and cognitive information).

The increased activation found by our previous model-based study in thalamus and motor cortex might be due to a number of factors. One explanation is the possibly superior power of the event-related approach to detect brain activity (due to the balloon presses) in these regions. In our model-free approach, the extensive activation of the medial cerebellum is of special interest in view of earlier studies that proposed a causal role for the cerebellum in psychosis and hallucinations.

This partially conflicts with earlier studies that found inverse correlations between CEN and DMN, and the subsequent models that emphasize the competition between the CEN and DMN in their preponderance.

In this patient group, these components of the hallucination network appear to be essential in the mediation of AVH. The right-sided insula and Broca's homologue (IC28) are positioned centrally within the hallucination network, and appear to be responsible for the production of preconscious linguistic constructs to which excessive salience is assigned by the SN (IC28, IC59). The insula propagates the stimulus further downstream in the direction of middle frontal regions, where the SMA and ACC appear to respond to the false prediction, activating the planum temporale (which projects the voices into external space) and enforcing the conscious perception of AVH. Sustained attention to the ensuing percept is probably provided by the working memory ICs (IC38 and CENs). The bilateral CEN showed the strongest connection with these AVH-related ICs. The cerebellum, in turn, might be involved in the disrupted updating and learning from the false sensory predictions in psychosis or in a more physiological process, such as emotional modulation. Two earlier studies focusing on the interaction between resting-state networks have underlined the importance of the SN in the mediation of AVH. Thus Manoliu et al. studied the triple network model, and reported that right anterior insular activity is associated with increased DMN-CEN interaction and severity of hallucinations, while Lefebvre et al. used network modelling to study effective connectivity in the triple network model plus the left hippocampus. Using an innovative design, they distinguished four phases in hallucinations, and found the SN (including the insula) to mediate switching between the DMN and CEN during active hallucinations. In addition, they found evidence that hippocampal input to the salience network evokes the hallucinatory state. In our results, DMN and CEN are not directly associated with the hallucinatory experience, rather showing deactivation during AVH. Altered influence between the DMN and CEN could still co-occur with or follow the onset of AVH within our patient group, however, this is hard to compare considering the breakdown of the large-scale DMN and CEN into multiple subnetworks in our analysis.

However, if the goal is to identify an optimal causal model for a phenotype within a broad context of neural mechanisms, this criticism is less relevant. Attributing psychological functions to specific brain regions is arbitrary and, instead, the focus should be on assessing the global mechanistic model of the symptom, disease or cognitive process under study. Secondly, a substantial number of ICs was found to originate primarily from noise, and had to be removed using denoising algorithms based on supervised learning. The substantial amount of noise in the data might have been due to the liberal method of temporal filtering used or, alternatively, to the possibly lower signal-to-noise ratio of the PRESTO scanning technique. Nevertheless, the higher sampling rate of PRESTO (in comparison with Echo Planar Imaging) was a clear advantage of our study with regard to power and the ability to discern potentially meaningful signals from physiological noise. In the third place, the absence of a control group prevented us from making any firm inferences regarding the specific pathological deficits or pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the mediation of hallucinations. However, it should be emphasized that the primary goal of this study was not to investigate such pathogenetic mechanisms, but to identify the mechanistic model for the occurrence of AVH within the context of the afflicted brain: more specifically, to facilitate local intervention with the aid of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation. Pathological changes in psychosis may significantly alter normal functional neuroanatomy (both in terms of structure and function). Therefore, for the purpose of clinical intervention, it is necessary to know the neural mechanisms underlying psychotic experiences within the context of the disease, rather than the healthy situation. Additionally, our study shows that many functionally significant ICs are not significantly associated with AVH experience, providing a within-subject control condition. Future studies that aim to examine pathogenic mechanisms might benefit from including a control group consisting of healthy controls, siblings of psychotic patients, non-hallucinating patients with previous episodes of psychosis, or patients with infrequent hallucinations. Such imaging studies can be performed during the resting state or during an auditory stimulus-detection task that is matched to the psychotic experiences of the patients. In the fourth place, as noted above, the LOFS R3 algorithm used allowed to determine causal directions for only 25% of the links. As LOFS R3 does not make any forced choices, this may indicate the existence of reciprocal connections in the remaining links, as can be expected in neural networks. On the other hand, it may also indicate that this algorithm prefers accuracy of directionality over directionality. One way to improve this estimation would be to i) choose components of interest based (COIs) on the present study, ii) use the time series of COIs in relation to the modeled BOLD response according to the hallucination timings to estimate the order of activation of COIs, and iii) pre-inform the causal search algorithm with directions of links based on this order of activation. Although this would only be feasible in individual subject-level analyses of effective connectivity, the benefit would be substantial as a detailed depiction of functional circuits involved in the mediation of AVH would allow accurate predictions of locations to be targeted with therapeutic techniques within individuals, i.e., by selecting the most influential nodes in the functional networks at hand. Moreover, enforcing further sparsity in the network might also help to estimate causal links, as this will reduce cyclical (feedback) connections and benefit the display of the dominant direction of information in the brain circuits under study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 64567, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 64579, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We systematically decomposed the fMRI data from the hallucinating brains of patients diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder into functional subnetworks, and reconstructed these into a whole-brain directed network. This method, which we compared to the draining of a pond to lay bare its entire ecosystem, revealed 98 independent components (ICs) which were active in patients who had consciously experienced AVH during the time of scanning. These ICs clustered into seven modules with distinct physiological functions, involving resting state, central-executive, salience, cerebellar, subcortical, and stimulus-response processing. Functional subnetworks comprising the hallucination network are Broca's right homologue, the right insula, the bilateral anterior cingulate, premotor cortex, and the supramarginal gyrus, whereas the CENs, Broca's area, and cerebellar regions constitute probable and more distant tributaries to the mediation of AVH. On the basis of the present findings, we conclude that in our treatment-refractory patient group, AVH appear to be largely mediated by the SN making false predictions about the risk and (hence) origin of linguistic percepts derived from Broca's homologue, followed by subsequent processing errors in the anterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum and other cognitive areas. Our findings mostly comply with model-based studies reporting faulty error monitoring as a major factor for the mediation of AVH. Future local intervention studies should consider focusing interventions on Broca's homologue or on SN subparts, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, instead of the traditional left temporoparietal cortex (T3P3 in EEG electrode placement system).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66293, "infons": {"file": "gr6.jpg", "id": "f0030", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "ICs summary spatial maps with axial view for most informative slices, red to yellow color-coding for positive Z-values.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66413, "infons": {"file": "gr6.jpg", "id": "f0030", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig"}, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 1", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66434, "infons": {"file": "gr7.jpg", "id": "f0035", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Rotating animations of module spatial maps derived from stacked ICs per module.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66514, "infons": {"file": "gr7.jpg", "id": "f0035", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig"}, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 2", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66535, "infons": {"file": "gr8.jpg", "id": "f0040", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Rotating animations of module spatial maps derived from stacked ICs per module.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66615, "infons": {"file": "gr8.jpg", "id": "f0040", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig"}, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 3", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66636, "infons": {"file": "gr9.jpg", "id": "f0045", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Rotating animations of module spatial maps derived from stacked ICs per module.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66716, "infons": {"file": "gr9.jpg", "id": "f0045", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig"}, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 4", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66737, "infons": {"file": "gr10.jpg", "id": "f0050", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Rotating animations of module spatial maps derived from stacked ICs per module.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66817, "infons": {"file": "gr10.jpg", "id": "f0050", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig"}, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 5", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66838, "infons": {"file": "gr11.jpg", "id": "f0055", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Rotating animations of module spatial maps derived from stacked ICs per module.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66918, "infons": {"file": "gr11.jpg", "id": "f0055", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig"}, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 6", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 66939, "infons": {"file": "gr12.jpg", "id": "f0060", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Rotating animations of module spatial maps derived from stacked ICs per module.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67019, "infons": {"file": "gr12.jpg", "id": "f0060", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig"}, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 7", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67040, "infons": {"file": "gr13.jpg", "id": "f0065", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Rotating animations of module spatial maps derived from stacked ICs per module.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67120, "infons": {"file": "gr13.jpg", "id": "f0065", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig"}, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 8", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 67141, "infons": {"file": "gr14.jpg", "id": "f0070", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Fig. 1, with an overlay constituting the coarse anatomy of the brain.

The center of the IC network was occupied by the pDMN. The cerebellum appeared to be positioned somewhat out of place, folding around the left side of the IC graph and connecting to various cortical ICs, which might be indicative of the close functional relationships of these cerebellar areas with a broad range of cortical activities. Since the force-directed layout algorithm follows a highly simple rule (positioning of elements in 3D space according to a lowest energy principle), this suggests that the relative positioning of brain areas is the result of a maximally efficient process (i.e. unlike motor blocks in some cars).
