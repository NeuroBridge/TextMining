We speculate that, by engaging the frontal executive thalamic subregions to a greater extent, women may be better able to accommodate behavioral control despite diminished saliency related activities in the perceptual thalamus. Compared to women, men are more prone to risk taking and impulsive behavior. Here, men demonstrated higher BIS score, which was associated with elevated physiological arousal to salient stimuli (Zhang et al., 2015), and a significant correlation between BIS and AUDIT scores.

Further, an earlier study reported diminished error-related negativity in heavy as compared to light or non-drinkers but noted no sex differences. Thus, a prospective study involving more heavier-drinking individuals is needed to address these issues. In particular, men showed higher AUDIT and BIS score than women, and studies with more women with higher impulsivity and more severe drinking problems would clarify the sources and significance of the sex differences reported here.
