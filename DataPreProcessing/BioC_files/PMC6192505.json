This method has led to the discovery of robust patterns of correlated activity also known as intrinsic connectivity networks (ICN\u2019s). Some of these networks have been shown to be associated with core neurocognitive domains and sensory functions like working memory and attention, (central executive network, CEN), self-monitoring (default mode network, DMN), externally directed cognition (dorsal and ventral attention networks, DAN and VAN), experience of salience (salience network, SN), and auditory processing (auditory network). Since schizophrenia is characterized by abnormalities in these functions the associated ICN\u2019s have been incorporated into a number of models for schizophrenia. First, schizophrenia has been proposed to be associated with errors in self-monitoring as a result of decreased communication within the DMN and/or abnormal interaction between the DMN and DAN. Along the same lines, aberrant DMN activity has been proposed to be the result of a failure of the fronto-parietal control system (CEN, SN and VAN) to control the DMN activity. Second, the SN models propose that psychosis occur as a result of inappropriately attached salience. Third, other models focus on network abnormalities between regions involved in directed effort (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC], posterior cingulate cortex [PCC] and hippocampus) and auditory processing (auditory cortex). The overall strength of these models is the focus on system-level neuropathology because the diverse symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to be associated with a break down in large-scale neuronal networks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3666, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several studies have reported alterations in functional connectivity in medicated long-term ill patients with schizophrenia. Despite a trend towards alterations in cortico-subcortical networks, prefrontal cortex and the DMN, results so far have been inconsistent. This could be explained by the presence of known confounders such as medication and disease progression. Narrowing the search to studies in Antipsychotic-Na\u00efve First-Episode (ANFE) patients does not provide a clear picture, eg, one study found higher connectivity between PCC, a central part of the DMN, and task positive regions such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to another study reporting no alterations of DLPFC connectivity. Furthermore, one study found increased connectivity within the DMN and increased connectivity between DMN and fronto-parietal networks in ANFE patients, whereas another study reported decreased connectivity between DMN and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) that is a part of the DMN, and no alteration in connectivity between DMN and fronto-parietal networks.
