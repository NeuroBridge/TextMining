The two hemispheres interact with each other via callosal fibers. Healthy individuals benefit from such inter-hemispheric interaction.

First, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) strength and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to measure the brain lateralization in previous studies.

It still remains unknown to what extent inter- and/or intra-hemispheric FC contributes to disrupted asymmetry in the brain in patients with schizophrenia. Second, it is unclear whether such disrupted asymmetry represents an endophenotype for schizophrenia. An endophenotype is state independent and heritable, and segregates with known illness loci. Endophenotype is often observed in unaffected siblings at an increased rate than in the general population. Third, existing evidence suggests that antipsychotic drugs can alter rsFC patterns; in addition, changes induced by antipsychotic drugs in brain network topology can predict individual treatment response. However, it is still unknown whether disrupted asymmetry in the brain is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7356, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present study sought to address these questions. Patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia, unaffected siblings and healthy controls were recruited in the study. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was used to assess voxel-wise inter- and intra-hemispheric FCs. Inter- and intra-hemispheric FCs were calculated between a given voxel and other voxels from the opposite hemisphere (inter-hemispheric FCs) and the same hemisphere (intra-hemispheric FCs). Then, a quantitative parameter of asymmetry (PAS) was calculated to reflect inter- and/or intra-hemispheric asymmetry (PAS\u202f=\u202fFCinter\u202f\u2212\u202fFCintra). This voxel-wise method does not depend on pre-defined regions of interest (ROIs) in two hemispheres, therefore minimizing potential confounding effects of structural asymmetry and selection bias caused by ROIs. Previously, autonomy index (AI), an asymmetry parameter, was calculated by counting the numbers of voxels with abnormal functional asymmetry. AI is valuable to quantify functional asymmetry. However, AI ignores the correlation coefficient of each voxel, which is an important characteristic of functional asymmetry. Therefore, we proposed a novel method, PAS, to quantify correlation coefficients of voxels with functional asymmetry in the present study. Unaffected siblings were recruited to examine whether disrupted asymmetry represent an endophenotype for schizophrenia. Patients received olanzapine treatment for 8\u202fweeks. Previous univariate analysis could predict clinical response at the group level, which was of little utility to guide treatment decision making for individual patients in the clinical setting. By contrast, pattern classification techniques including support vector machine (SVM) allow prediction at the individual level, which might be helpful in the clinical setting. Such methods have been used to differentiate patients with adolescent-onset schizophrenia and healthy controls, and to predict clinical response to electroconvulsive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the baseline PAS scores can predict individual clinical response to olanzapine treatment at week 8 using the SVM method.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9576, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Materials and methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9598, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Subjects", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9607, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Forty-six patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia and 46 unaffected siblings were recruited from the Mental Health Center, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University in China between June 2013 and July 2014; 46 healthy controls were recruited from the local community during the same time period.

Having patients on the same antipsychotic medication olanzapine was helpful to minimize the confounding effects caused by the use of different antipsychotic medications as they may cause differential effects on brain function; however, this also comprised the generalizability of the study findings to patients on antipsychotic medications other than olanzapine. Third, a correlation coefficient threshold of r\u202f>\u202f0.2 was used to calculate the PAS scores. The choice of such a threshold might affect the findings.
