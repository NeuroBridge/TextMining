We used SEM in the \u2018lavaan\u2019 package with full-information maximum likelihood estimation to derived a latent score of general fluid intelligence (gf) for each wave from six non-verbal tests of cognitive function from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale IIIUK: matrix reasoning (non-verbal reasoning), block design (constructional ability), symbol search and digit symbol (processing speed), letter number sequencing and digit span backwards (working memory). Within the model, each cognitive test was adjusted for age in days at the time of assessment and sex at the manifest level. We constrained the loadings for each individual raw score across waves (i.e. equal loadings for matrix reasoning at baseline and follow-up). Beyond the analyses of szPGRS to the mediator (A path), to test whether the mediation (change from path C to C\u2032) was statistically significant (pFDR\u202f<\u202f0.05), we tested whether the direct path of szPGRS to gf (path C) and the indirect path from the mediator to gf (path B) were significant. Fig.\u00a02 shows a simplified diagram of the model that was used to examine this hypothesis.

However, a limitation of generating a general factor from water diffusion MRI parameters measured in multiple tracts is that it describes commonalities among white matter tracts while excluding tract-specific individualities. Our findings indicate that the association of szPGRS with white matter MD is strongly driven by the splenium, arcuate, ATR and cingulum, all tracts previously implicated in schizophrenia. Structural abnormalities in the corpus callosum in schizophrenia have been well documented affecting interhemispheric communication in patients. The arcuate fasciculus as an associative fibre connects the frontal cortex with the temporal and parietal cortices and may underlie language processing anomalies in the disorder. The ATR serves as a link between the thalamic nuclei and the prefrontal cortex, and dysfunction of the thalamus has been associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, particularly with cognitive deficits and negative symptoms.

Nevertheless, szPGRS evinced non-significant detrimental relations with all brain structural metrics. The fact that the LBC1936 comprises relatively healthy, community-dwelling older adults, none of whom have schizophrenia, coupled with the relatively brief (3 year) period of follow-up may have limited our ability to detect slighter effects. Interestingly, a previous study on targeted genetic analysis showed that differentially expressed genes in a well-characterised rat model of vascular white matter disease were associated with white matter hyperintensities (which exhibit elevated MD and reduced FA) in the LBC1936 and these included genes associated with schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental intellectual disabilities. These results suggest that genetic risk for schizophrenia may have a role in age-related changes in brain structural connectivity, even among individuals who are not diagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous studies have suggested the conceptualization of schizophrenia as a syndrome of accelerated ageing indicating, for instance, significant declines in white matter coherence more than twice that of age-matched controls, with this reduction being linear from early adulthood and steeper as a function of increasing age. Therefore, it may be possible that higher szPGRS confers certain risks for accelerated white matter ageing in healthy older participants. It is also likely that other factors such as gene-gene interactions, rare variants, and gene-environment interplay may help to explain the association between risk variants for schizophrenia and brain structural impairments.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42260, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In general, white matter tracts showed reductions in FA (standardised r from 0.056 to \u22120.062) and increases in MD (standardised r from 0.171 to 0.452) as a function of increasing age. These results are in line with those of previous studies where white matter microstructure declines with age (reviewed in). For instance, we found that MD of more frontal white matter tracts was more affected while more occipital tracts were more resilient to the effects of age (see Table\u00a01). This is consistent with the hypothesis that ageing has region-specific effects, in particular the existence of an anterior-posterior gradient of age-related decline whereby tracts that are the last to develop are the most vulnerable to the ageing process. This pattern could be a consequence of the finding that later developed tracts are more thinly myelinated and therefore more susceptible to decline. The ATR and uncinate fasciculi, conversely, showed an increase in FA with age in this study. White matter fibres within these tracts are known to have a complex architecture due to the presence of a large number of crossing fibres. Since FA is highly dependent on white matter architecture, it is possible that a loss of white matter fibres might lead to an increase in FA if the remaining fibres are more uniformly orientated than they were previously. Therefore, the observed increase of FA in the ATR and uncinate fasciculi may reflect the overall effect of loss of crossing fibres resulting from age-related neurodegeneration.

Mean edge weight and strength decreased significantly over time while decreases in global efficiency and clustering coefficient did not reach significance. Reductions in graph theory measures, which describe topological aspects of the brain's networks were found to co-exist with microstructural declines in white matter tracts over time as shown in Figure\u00a05.

However, in the current analysis we segmented the tracts of interest using probabilistic neighbourhood tractography, which uses single seed point tractography, followed up by a streamline rejection criterion where individual streamlines are retained or rejected based on their probabilities under the topology model. This results in a tract made up from a \u2018core\u2019 of the streamlines that follow the expected tract topology, which is potentially less sensitive to pve than other tractography methods which segment larger white matter regions.
