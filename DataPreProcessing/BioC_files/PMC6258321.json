The data processing strategies for fMRI data can be roughly grouped into two schemes: hypothesis-driven and data-driven. Hypothesis-driven methods exploit actual or supposed a priori knowledge about brain activity and, generally, study neurological relationships across a few regions or with respect to specific stimuli. Data-driven methods, on the other hand, offer a less targeted and more holistic approach, often by decomposing the observed data into a set of factors. Such techniques include: principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), dictionary learning/sparse coding (DL), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), tensor-based methods, and independent vector analysis (IVA). The performance of each of these factor models depends on the validity of their modeling assumptions for the dataset being analyzed and, thus, motivates a comparison of different factor models on the same dataset.

This is done by comparing the p-value corresponding to the t-statistic from the GDM with the p-value obtained using Hotelling\u2019s T2-test. Hotelling\u2019s T2-test, the multivariate counterpart to the two-sample t-test assess the validity of the hypothesis that a two multivariate distributions have the same mean vectors against the alternative hypothesis that they do not. For this application, we evaluate whether the vector containing the subject loadings of all of the biomarkers from the controls is different from the vector containing the corresponding subject loadings from the patients.

The reason for this is due to the fact the Hotelling\u2019s T2-test is the classical measure of the total difference between the subject covariations associated with the patients and those associated with the controls. However, it is important to note that the advantage of summarizing the discriminatory power through the use of GDMs rather than through the use of Hotelling\u2019s T2-test is that the GDMs, i.e., the spatial maps, themselves can be related. This enables the identification of regions that differentiate patients and controls in different decompositions and a comparison of these regions. In order to explore the differences between individual ICAs and IVA in terms of the regions that are found to differentiate between patients and controls, we compare the GDMs derived from each of the methods for each of the three tasks after thresholding the maps at |Z| > 1.96. Using such a technique, we can visualize how much joint discriminative information each region possesses across tasks.

This highlights the ability of a joint analysis using IVA to emphasize similarities across datasets and also highlights the need to compare the results of a joint analysis to those of single dataset analyses, since some of the regions associated with a subset of the tasks may not be as strongly emphasized using IVA. Additionally, we can investigate the extent to which IVA emphasizes similar regions across all tasks when compared with individual ICAs by looking at the regions in the GDMs that are found to activate at |Z| > 1.96 for all tasks.

This means that the results of a unimodal factorization of this dataset cannot be strongly associated with the measured clinical outcomes. However, the GDM created from the IVA decomposition of that dataset does correlate significantly, even after a conservative correction for multiple comparisons. This trend is similar to the one observed in Figure 2, i.e., that the factors extracted from datasets, which may not, inherently, be strongly associated with behavioral variables of interest, using a joint analysis can have a stronger association with the behavioral variables. However, this may come at the cost of reducing the associative power of datasets that are strongly associated with that variable by themselves, in this case the AOD and SIRP datasets. This motivates estimating the amount of joint information that exists between fMRI tasks prior to performing an analysis, see e.g.,, as well as comparing the results of a joint analysis with those from individual analyses.

This leads to the issue of how to objectively compare the performance of different methods, without the need for a tedious factor alignment step. In this paper, we have presented a novel technique, GDMs, to relate the results of different fMRI analysis methods based upon either their ability to detect differences between patients and controls or to correlate behavioral variables as well as to highlight which regions differ between the methods. We applied this technique to the decompositions of fMRI data from three tasks derived using individual analyses using ICA as well as a joint analysis using IVA. Our results show that GDMs are an effective technique to compare the results of different factorization methods on real fMRI data. Additionally, through our comparison of the results using individual ICAs and IVA, we find that a joint analysis using IVA is able to determine regions that are more similar across tasks and can be more discriminative between patients and controls than those found using individual analyses using ICA. It is important to note that though we construct GDMs based upon highlighting group differences and associations with behavioral variables, GDMs could also be constructed from the output of a regression analysis, which can account for the effects of confounding variables and be used when there are less clearly defined groups. We should also note that though developed in the context of comparing different decompositions of multi-task fMRI data, GDMs can be applied to data from different neuroimaging modalities, such as electroencephalogram or diffusion tensor imaging, or even in the context of multimodal fusion.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35501, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
