Disruption of these processes by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) could produce alterations either in structural and functional brain connectivity or in their association in cannabis (CB) users. Graph theoretic structural and functional networks were generated with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional imaging in 37 current CB users and 31 healthy non-users. The primary outcome measures were coupling between structural and functional connectivity, global network characteristics, association between the coupling and network properties, and measures of rich-club organization. Structural-functional coupling was globally preserved showing a positive association in current CB users. However, the users had disrupted associations between structural-functional coupling and network topological characteristics, most perturbed for shorter connections implying region-specific disruption by CB use. Rich-club analysis revealed impaired structural-functional coupling in the hippocampus and caudate of users. This study provides evidence of the abnormal structural-functional association in CB users. The effect was predominant in shorter connections of the brain network, suggesting that the impact of CB use or predispositional factors may be most apparent in local interconnections. Notably, the hippocampus and caudate specifically showed aberrant structural and functional coupling.

A recent national survey indicated that 22.2 million persons were current users of marijuana, corresponding to 8.3% of the population 12 years of age or older. The primary psychoactive component of CB is \u03949\u2013tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) known as a low-efficacy agonist for the endocannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. CB1 receptors are widely distributed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, neocortical regions and hippocampus. Since the endocannabinoid system mediates various forms of synaptic plasticity, THC likely interferes with these processes. In hippocampal culture of rat neurons, for example, THC can inhibit induction of new synapse formation. THC exposure in adolescent rats results in disruption of endocannabinoid signaling, normal maturation of the glutamatergic system and synaptic pruning. THC treatment in adolescent rats also results in lower dendritic length and numbers in the hippocampus coupled with impaired radial maze performance. These findings are consistent with a pivotal role for the endocannabinoid system in the development of neural connectivity and function. Consequently, there is a pressing need to clarify how cannabinoids affect brain connectivity in humans and whether these changes account for specific harms or possible benefits of CB use.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3155, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Functional neuroimaging studies, which examine correlations in activity between brain regions, suggest that acute THC administration alters resting-state functional connectivity (FC). Chronic CB users exhibited altered functional recruitment of the prefrontal cortex, inhibitory control networks (mean age = 23.7 years) and regions spanning the cerebellum to the prefrontal cortex (mean age = 19.3 year). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a way to map network organization using white matter (WM) tractography to examine structural connectivity (SC) between gray matter regions. The integration of SC with FC allows the characterization of functional dynamics of the brain in terms of spatial topology. This approach, termed structural-functional (SC-FC) coupling, is defined by the association between FC and SC allowing more sensitive detection of subtle brain alterations than any single imaging modality. Importantly, the structural network constrains the functional network to regions with direct connections. It therefore would be well suited to test how observed cellular alterations in synaptic connectivity and signaling impact the functional organization of the brain in human CB users. While SC-FC coupling has not yet been assessed in CB users, this approach has shown alterations in other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Structural neuroimaging abnormalities in adult CB users have been most consistent for regions high in CB receptors.

Rich-club nodes of a network have been defined as the nodes that are not only much more connected but also highly linked among themselves.

Both age of onset and total lifetime exposures have been associated with risk for subsequent psychotic disorders, and thus represent potential predictors of brain network changes linked with vulnerability to psychosis.

Notably, the level of SC-FC coupling did not differ between groups (Figure 1A), which may reflect an intact global pattern of SC-FC association in CB users. CB might be associated with more pronounced local brain connectivity alterations rather than alterations in the whole brain network, reflecting by the heterogeneous distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the brain.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23355, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SC-FC coupling was significantly associated with structural network measures related to communication of neural information such as the global efficiency (GE) and characteristic path length (\u03bb) (Figure 1B). These relationships suggest that structural network organization optimized for communication flow is associated with globally stronger SC-FC interaction. Specifically, a more efficient brain network with shorter path length also exhibited higher SC-FC coupling in the healthy non-users. This relationship has also been observed in the course of brain maturation. Our findings converge with other evidence that such an optimal SC-FC relationship is associated with well-integrated network properties (i.e., higher global efficiency and shorter characteristic path length), which indicates that more efficient brain architecture with shorter path lengths may be beneficial for better neural information transfer in the brain. In CB users, however, similar associations between the network topology and SC-FC coupling were absent. This attenuated correlation suggests that spatial patterns of FC constrained with SC could be altered while the overall association between SC and FC is preserved. Previous studies showed that FC strength is likely to be higher at shorter distances between brain regions. Moreover, other studies indicate that the SC-FC relationship is mediated by the distance between interconnected regions. Replicating these previous findings, the SC-FC coupling of non-users was more directly related to the network measures (i.e., global efficiency and characteristic path length) for shorter network connections, but this was not the case for users (Figure 2). Network characteristics were also disrupted in CB users, suggesting that local brain regions with short connections were more affected within the whole brain connectome.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25210, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Stronger expression of RC organization was found mainly in the subcortical regions as well as distributed cortical areas, highly consistent with previous RC studies in adults, children, and newborns. Our finding of reduced RC connectivity in CB users (Figure 3B) suggests potential connectome abnormalities, particularly around hub regions central to the integration of information transfer among distributed brain regions. Interestingly, abnormal RC connectivity was found in the hippocampus, caudate, and pallidum (Figure 3D), regions of dense distribution of CB1 receptors in the brain. In addition, the hippocampus and dorsal striatum play important roles in contextual learning and habit formation that maintain addictive behaviors. In the present data, the hippocampus of CB users showed higher regional SC-FC coupling, while the caudate of users had a reduced coupling level (Figure 3E). The hippocampus is a region with one of the highest CB1 receptor expression levels, and CB-related structural and functional changes have frequently been found in this region in both human and animal models. One interpretation for the study findings could be that increased SC-FC coupling in users may indicate that functional interaction through the hippocampus was influenced by CB use and was consequently more likely to depend on the underlying structural connections indicating less dynamic brain function, as similar to a previous study on schizophrenia. On the other hand, reduced coupling of the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia may reflect cannabinoid modulation of dopaminergic neurons since CB1 receptors are abundant in dopaminergic pathways (e.g., the striatum). Further, CB use reduces the level of dopamine in the striatum, reducing dopamine synthesis in the dorsal striatum including the caudate. Therefore, decreased SC-FC coupling in the caudate of CB users may indicate decoupled interactions of SC and FC. Reduced resting-state FC has been found in the right hippocampus and the right caudate of chronic CB users [mean \u00b1 SD = 21 \u00b1 2 years], suggesting attenuated frontal and sensory inputs to those regions. On the other hand, findings with greater FC have also been reported in the hippocampus of non-dependent CB users at rest and in the dorsal striatum including the caudate during cognitive tasks, suggesting compensatory processes. Our findings further suggest that current CB users have altered SC-FC coupling in the hippocampus and caudate.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27677, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "No significant associations were found between the coupling measures and clinical variables (i.e., lifetime CB use, age of the first CB use, or the number of uses over the past 30 days). Alterations in coupling may predate exposure to cannabis use and reflect genetic or environmental factors that increase risk for substance use. It has been estimated that 50 to 70% of the variation in CB use can be attributed to genetic factors and about 20% of variation reflect shared environmental factors. found that predispositional factors accounted for the relationship between amygdala volume and CB use. Twin studies indicated that CB users showed IQ deficits that were apparent prior to initiation of CB use and could be attributed to familial factors. A recent genome-wide association study identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms at three genomic locations associated with risk for CB dependence. Thus, genetic and predisposing environmental factors may be associated with neurobehavioral changes in CB users, perhaps including SC-FC coupling. The recently initiated NIH Adolescent and Brain Cognitive Development Study, which will follow 10,000 healthy children into adulthood in conjunction with periodic brain imaging, may allow a better understanding of the contributions of genetic factors, environmental factors and CB use on brain network organization and dynamics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29052, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The lack of correlation between connectivity and coupling measures to CB use may also be related to the difficulty in quantifying exposure to psychoactive compounds in cannabis, the relatively short time of exposure to cannabis in this young adult sample and the exclusion of CB users with any other psychiatric or substance use disorder. Variability in THC and cannabidiol (CBD) dosage in cannabis products, differences in mode of administration and individual differences in metabolism of cannabinoids are difficult or impossible to assess by self-report methods. The lack of significant correlations may thus reflect this uncertainty in measurement of actual level of exposure. Our CB user samples was relatively young (21.1 \u00b1 3.8 years old; cf. Table 1), period of use was an average of 4.7 \u00b1 3.4 years and only a minority met criteria for dependence. A longer duration of heavy use may be required for correlations to reach sufficient magnitude for statistical detection. Finally, our sample only included CB users without current psychiatric problems or other types of substance use disorders. Since about 90% of persons with CB dependence have comorbid psychiatric disorders, this sampling approach likely excluded the most severely affected members of the user population.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30333, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study has several limitations. First, SC-FC coupling measures in the present data were not significantly correlated with self-reported measures of recent or lifetime exposures. Therefore, it should be noted that the between-group effects attributed to CB use may be due at least in part to other between-group effects. Second, only structural and functional node pairs, linked by direct anatomical connections, were used to compute SC-FC coupling. Because FC can also result from fewer interactions along multi-step structural paths, additional effects due to these indirect effects should not be underrated. SC was defined by the streamline counts extracted from our tractography technique. This may not be sufficient to reflect the true biological estimate of anatomical connectivity among distributed brain regions, since estimates from reconstructed fiber tracts are not considered to be directly equivalent to the density of axonal bundles, but rather an abstraction derived from the tracking algorithm. Furthermore, although we examined the brain network at a relatively high spatial resolution (= 1,014) and with a probabilistic tractography allowing multiple connections to achieve a minimal risk of type 2 error, some portion of extracted fibers might be still inaccurate due to complex fiber structure not resolved with the underlying tensor model, partial volume effects, and distance-dependent biases during fiber tracking. FC at rest is now widely considered to be dynamic over time, while the underlying SC profile is relatively static. Therefore, the SC-FC coupling might not have a simple one-to-one correspondence with each other. Indeed, some studies have shown that different network states exhibited at different times during resting state show different levels of correspondence with the anatomical connectivity.

Additionally, the association between SC-FC coupling and the brain\u2019s network topological characteristics was disrupted in CB users. This effect was predominant in shorter connections of the brain network, suggesting that the impact of CB use or predispositional factors may be most apparent in local interconnections. In terms of future research issues, replication of findings in early adolescence and later adulthood would help clarify the relation of SC-FC coupling alterations to age and duration of use. Research designs utilizing longitudinal tracking of at-risk persons, direct administration of cannabinoids while imaging and genetically informed designs could clarify whether these disturbances are consequences of CB use or neurodevelopmental factors which predate initiation of CB use.
