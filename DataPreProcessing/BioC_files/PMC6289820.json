However, the motor cortex is closely inter-connected with prefrontal and other brain regions, many of which show abnormalities in schizophrenia.

Defective PFC in schizophrenia has been well demonstrated in neuroimaging studies and used as a therapeutic target. Aberrant top-down effects from PFC on motor-related cortical and sub-cortical regions has been suggested to contribute to symptoms of schizophrenia. For example, catatonic patients not only exhibited prefrontal hypoactivation and frontal gray matter loss, but also had altered connections between PFC and premotor/motor cortex. In a recent study of Walther and colleagues, catatonia was associated with higher perfusion in supplementary motor area and prominent GM loss in frontal and insular cortices, which resemble the SICI-related PFC and insula clusters observed in our study. Schizophrenia patients with severe gesture deficits showed poor frontal lobe function. A middle PFC-motor cortico-cortical circuit(MPMCCC) that links high-order functions and movements allowing for psychomotor modulation has in fact been proposed by Northoff and colleagues to be the core circuitry for motor dysfunction is schizophrenia. This circuit is highly consistent with the PFC-M1 rsFC found to be associated with both the cortical inhibition biomarker and overall clinical symptoms here. Previous studies have also demonstrated top-down regulation of motor cortex by ipsilateral PFC, and the importance of connectivity between these areas in guiding actions. RsFC did not provide directional information, therefore, we cannot determine whether the influences of PFC on M1 were top-down or interactive regulations. However, the correlation between SICI and PFC-M1 rsFC may represent a modulation from PFC to M1, instead of M1 to PFC, because SICI measurement depended on directly probing M1.

The GABAergic dysfunction hypothesis in schizophrenia also has extensive support from clinical, genetic and postmortem studies. Therefore, the finding that PFC-M1 rsFC played a fundamental role in SICI in schizophrenia may also index a common underlying GABAergic mechanism leading to the strong correlation and mediation effects. It is noteworthy that the critical role of left PFC-M1 rsFC on SICI was only observed in patients but not in controls. As healthy controls do not have deficits in these structural, functional or GABAergic mechanisms, the relationship may be difficult to extract using only a modest sample size. Only in patients with deficits in many of these measures and the putatively shared underlying mechanisms, the relationships between imaging and behavioral biomarkers may have become apparent.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25408, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cerebellum VI, VIII are motor-related cerebellar areas. Moreover, cerebellum VI was also shown to be engaged along with prefrontal and parietal cortices in cognitively demanding tasks. Here we found M1 rsFCs with cerebellum VIII and VI were associated with SICI and BPRS, respectively(Table 2; Figure 1, 2 and S1). One parsimonious explanation would be that BPRS and SICI are not strongly related, and these findings may reflect the functional differentiations in these two cerebellar regions: the cerebellar VIII area and its connectivity with M1 is more related to aspects of the symptoms(BPRS), but the cerebellar VI area and its connectivity with M1 is more related to motor inhibition function(SICI). This is consistent with the literature. The cerebellar-motor circuit is linked to deficit of sensorimotor control in schizophrenia and stimulation of cerebellum altered the size of SICI at motor cortex; and the involvement of cerebellum in the neuropathology of schizophrenia is well supported. However, it should be noted that the association between SICI and cerebellum did not pass LOOCV test and this finding need to be confirmed by future studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26567, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The M1 rsFC with right insula was also associated with cortical inhibition in schizophrenia(Figure 1).

As the majority of patients here were currently treated with antipsychotics, we cannot rule out possible impacts of medication as antipsychotic drugs may alter functional connectivity and motor abnormalities. The four cases of medication-free patients here were too few to conduct meaningful sub-analysis. However, similar results were obtained after adding CPZ, education, and gender as additional covariates, suggesting at least that the current medication dosage, education level and gender may not be the main factors driving the results. It should be noticed that we excluded patients with substance abuse, so generalizing the current findings to schizophrenia patients with substance abuse need to be cautious. The moderate sample size limited ability to fully examine effects from covariates such as gender and comorbidity. Only SICI was used as the cortical inhibition index in the study; whether our findings can be replicated in analogous TMS measures (e.g., LICI, CSP) should be determined.
