Additionally, other tests of cognition and emotion processing may yield different findings than observed in the present study. Finally, a 5-minute resting state scan was used and longer sequences have more recently become preferred for more precise estimations of resting state function and connectivity. We note that the data included for analysis passed stringent thresholds for quality ensuring there was adequate data for detecting effects observed in the study. The 5-minute sequence with similar quality checking has been suitable to inform a variety of types of information. Despite these limitations, our findings provide evidence that the interplay between neuroendocrine systems, neural networks, and behavior may contribute to sex differences in schizophrenia. Specifically, associations with frontal and cerebellar cortices in female patients and the posterior cingulate in male patients may play sexually dimorphic roles in emotion processing and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26462, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Contributors         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26495, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Drs.
