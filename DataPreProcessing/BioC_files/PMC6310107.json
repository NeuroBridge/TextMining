Thus, developing accurate, data-driven methods that can classify and characterize the neural features of nicotine use disorder (NUD) would be a powerful clinical tool that could aid in optimizing treatment development and guide treatment modifications. This investigation applied support-vector machine-based classification to resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data from individuals diagnosed with NUD (n=108; 63 males) and matched nonsmoking controls (n=108; 63 males) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) to visualize the heterogeneity of NUD in individual smokers based on rsFC measures. Machine-based learning models identified five resting state networks (RSNs) that played a role in distinguishing smokers from controls: the posterior and anterior default mode networks, the sensorimotor network, the salience network, and the right executive control network. The classification method constructed classifiers with an average correct classification rate of 88.1% and an average area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to controls, individuals with NUD had weaker functional connectivity measures within these networks (p<0.05, false discovery rate corrected). Further, MDS visualization demonstrated that controls were similar to each other; whereas, individuals with NUD had less similarity to controls and to other individuals with NUD.

These neural networks can be evaluated through resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses, which provides a metric of brain activity based on temporal coherence of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) or perfusion fMRI signal fluctuations between disparate brain areas in the absence of an explicit task. As such, brain regions that spontaneously fluctuate in a highly correlated manner are termed resting state networks (RSNs) and are associated with known brain systems, such as visual, auditory, and sensorimotor systems.
