Measuring spontaneous, low-frequency fluctuations in neural activity throughout the brain during rest, commonly called resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), provides a snapshot of the strength of functional connections between neural networks.

Acute drug administration alters neurotransmitter activity throughout this network and ultimately changes voluntary drug use into the compulsive drug taking behavior that is characteristic of addiction. The core reward network is functionally connected to an extended reward network consisting of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC).

The core reward network is more closely linked with reward processing and learning after receipt of the reward, and may be less involved in the pre-decision reward anticipation on tasks like the BART as the extended reward and cognitive control networks. Our divergent results may also be due to our use of data-driven intrinsic networks, rather than a priori seeds; this allowed us to examine the interactions among brain regions within separate functional networks. One of the strengths of ICA is the ability to identify connectivity strength within overlapping networks and to detect and remove signal noise that confounds seed-based connectivity analyses. For these reasons, connectivity within large-scale functional networks may be more predictive of behavior than seed-regions or even task-related activity in affected brain regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26764, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results did not support our hypothesis that inverse connectivity between the extended reward and cognitive control network would be linked with worse learning on the IGT. This was surprising, considering that extended reward and cognitive control inverse connectivity was associated with BART performance for cocaine users in the study. While we did not specify right or left cognitive control networks in our hypotheses since both are linked with decision-making and inhibitory control, prior fMRI and PET research on IGT and BART performance with stimulant users has implicated right-sided cognitive control network activity involved in reasoning, inhibition, and memory. Alternatively, we found BART performance to be associated with extended reward and left-sided cognitive control network connectivity, primarily involved in language processing and recall of associative cues. Compulsive behavior in addiction is, in part, facilitated by associative learning between drug cues and reward expectancies and chronic cocaine users show reduced interhemispheric connectivity of the cognitive control networks. Our findings may point to an increasing role of associative recall facilitated by the left cognitive control network during decision making for cocaine users. This is supported by prior research showing cocaine-related increases in left cognitive control network rsFC. Future research using rsFC and task-based activity may be able to parse out the distinct roles of each hemisphere in impulsivity and addictive behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28300, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although cocaine users demonstrated strong links between rsFC and BART performance, they had an insignificant association between rsFC and intertemporal discounting on the MCT. We hypothesized that inverse connectivity of reward and attentional salience networks would be indicative of network imbalance and related to higher discount rates for cocaine users. Instead, this was true for the control participants. The core reward network is linked with immediate reward valuation while the attentional salience network is linked with delayed reward valuation. The significant association between resting-state connectivity and intertemporal discounting may be predictive of healthy and expected functional network control over the valuation of delayed over immediate rewards for our control participants who had a wide range of discounting rates. While prior research found that an uncoupling of salience and reward networks was related to higher impulsivity for cocaine users, our results suggest that imbalance may instead be observed as a dissociation between rsFC and impulsive behavior. Prior studies have found a disconnection between cocaine users\u2019 self-perception and actual task performance, which could be described as neural-behavioral dissociation. Neural-behavioral dissociation occurs when autonomic responses fail to predict behavioral outcomes, which is believed to be caused by reduced input from cortical executive control over subcortical regions involved in emotion and conditioned responding. Our results suggest a dissociation between the behavioral responses driven by the core reward network involved in autonomic responses to drug rewards, and the attentional salience network involved in informing behavioral decision making.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30051, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The current study adds to the literature by demonstrating how functional connectivity between large-scale networks is associated with impulsive decision making for cocaine users. The strengths of the study include its use of data-driven networks, a relatively large sample size compared to prior research in this area, generalizability to real-world cocaine users, and a focus on reward and executive control networks implicated in impulsive decision making in the context of addiction. The effects of cocaine use in these results are more accurately described as the effects of a cocaine use disorder, in which cocaine use is the primary drug of choice and co-occurs with polysubstance use (i.e., smoking, alcohol, and marijuana). While this may introduce confounding effects from multiple substances, recruiting participants who only use cocaine would have limited our generalizability to the poly-substance cocaine users typically seen in the United States.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31012, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The study also had several limitations. Age, education, and motion differed across groups and were controlled for in the group analyses. Although results were unchanged with these variables removed from the analysis, differences in demographic characteristics could have contributed to the group effects detected considering their known influence on rsFC. Future research with samples that include more variability on these factors would provide an opportunity to examine their influence on functional connectivity and cognitive outcomes. Given the cross-sectional nature of the current research in this area, it is unclear if changes in rsFC and impulsivity are due to chronic substance use, or predisposing genetic, individual, or environmental factors. In addition, the moderation analyses may have been underpowered to detect small interaction effects and we did not correct for multiple comparisons, given that the hypotheses were derived independently and a priori. Finally, the findings should be interpreted with caution in light of recent research showing that the traditional five-minute resting-state fMRI scan may not be as reliable as longer scans. A priori defined networks, such as the fronto-parietal network, tend to be the most reliable, but test-retest reliability is diminished in subcortical networks due to smaller anatomical regions and potentially unique activity patterns.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32410, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest cocaine use disorder is related to altered associations between impulsivity and reward and executive control network rsFC coupling.
