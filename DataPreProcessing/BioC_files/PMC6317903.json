These RSNs were defined using validated network masks that are publicly available through the Functional Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FIND) Lab, Stanford University (http://findlab.stanford.edu/functional_ROIs.html).

We used a wavelet filter of Daubechies Least Asymmetric with a wavelet length of 8. We focused on scale 4 wavelet coefficients, because the most relevant information for resting-state fMRI data is mainly contained within this scale. We then extracted the phases of the fMRI time series for each RSN in each participant by applying the Hilbert transform to the wavelet-filtered fMRI BOLD signals to obtain the associated analytical signals. The analytic signal represents a narrowband signal, s(t), in the time domain as a rotating vector with an instantaneous phase, \u03c6(t), and an instantaneous amplitude, A (t), i.e., s(t) = A(t) cos (\u03c6(t)). The phase and the amplitude are given by the argument and the modulus, respectively, of the complex signal z(t), given by z(t) = s(t) + iH[s(t)], where i is the imaginary unit and H[s(t)] is the Hilbert transform of s(t).

We detected an effect of group for sex and IQ and we therefore conducted collinearity diagnostics using regression models. These variables were not collinear as their variance inflation factor (VIF) ranged between 1 and 1.4 which is below the traditional threshold of 2 for collinearity. We performed three multivariate analyses of covariance (MANOVAs) to examine the effect of diagnosis separately on measures of network dynamics (synchrony and metastability), measures of within-network functional connectivity and measures of between-network functional connectivity. Sex and IQ were entered as covariates in all analyses. For each MANOVA, when the overall model was significant at p < 0.05, we conducted post-hoc pairwise comparisons for which the threshold of statistical significance was adjusted using Bonferroni correction based on the number of variables included in each model. In addition, the effect size of case-control differences in neuroimaging measures was calculated using the Cohen\u2019s d. The predictive value of the neuroimaging variables for clinical symptoms was only tested in the patient group. The four BPRS symptom scores were not collinear (|r| < 0.4) and were used as dependent factors in separate stepwise regression analyses. This approach operates by successively adding and removing predictor variables based on their squared t-statistic to select the best grouping of predictor variables that accounts for most of the variance (R2) in the outcome. The assumptions, advantages and limitations of this approach are well understood (e.g.). Stepwise regression models allow a principled and data-driven selection of predictor variables, that is largely independent of sample size, and are best suited for testing prespecified hypotheses about the predictor and outcome variables. This is the case here as our aim was to test the predictive value of predefined connectivity features for symptom severity in schizophrenia. Stepwise regression analyses are prone to R2 values inflation and are sensitive to the presence of collinearity amongst the predictor variables. To address these concerns, we undertook the following three steps: (a) Curve estimation and collinearity assessments were conducted to select the neuroimaging variables entered as independent predictors. Variables were considered co-linear if their pairwise correlation was |r| > 0.4. The synchrony and metastability of each network were the only highly correlated (r values ranged between 0.63 and 0.72) neuroimaging variables and therefore only metastability was entered in the regression analyses.

Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia have reported reductions in the volume of the constituent regions of the SAL network, in its internal coherence and its integration within the brain functional connectome. It has been proposed that the SAL network disruption impairs the appropriate attribution of salience to internal and external events and leads to reality distortion and to anxious/depressive symptoms.
