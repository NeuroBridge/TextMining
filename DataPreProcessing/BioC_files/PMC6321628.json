The proposed translation based fusion model contains a computing layer that learns \u201calignments\u201d (or links) between dynamic connectivity features from fMRI data and static gray matter patterns from sMRI data. The approach is evaluated on a multi-site dataset consisting of eye-closed resting state imaging data collected from 298 subjects (age- and gender matched 154 healthy controls and 144 patients with schizophrenia). We used dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC) states as the functional features and ICA-based sources from gray matter densities as the structural features. The dFNC states characterized by weakly correlated intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) were found to have stronger association with putamen and insular gray matter pattern, while the dFNC states of profuse strongly correlated ICNs exhibited stronger links with the gray matter pattern in precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and temporal cortex. Further investigation with the estimated link strength (or alignment score) showed significant group differences between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia in several key regions including temporal lobe, and linked these to connectivity states showing less occupancy in healthy controls.

A combination of two or more types of data for joint analysis is called multimodal fusion. Despite challenges to consider when combining data, research in multimodal fusion is rapidly growing due to its added value for basic, clinical, and cognitive neuroscience. Each imaging technique essentially provides a different view of brain structure or function. For example, BOLD fMRI measures the hemodynamic response related to the neural activity in the brain dynamically; sMRI provides information about the tissue type of the brain [gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)]. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) likewise can provide information on structural connectivity among brain networks.

To further resolve complex neuropathological puzzle of schizophrenia, multimodal imaging represents a promising strategy in psychosis research.

We hypothesize that gray matter variations might interact with the brain functional dynamics in an intricate way, and such relationships are buried in the data. In this work, we, therefore, utilize the ability of high level representation of deep models for potential discovery of brain structure-function links.

Another distinction can be seen in the right panel of Fig. 4 which depicts that alignments are more uniformly spread out for the dFNC states 3,4, and 5 than those of states 1 and 2 across. Alignment scores for individual states are shown in Fig. 3. In effect, each dFNC state has alignment scores across all 23 structural components and they sum to 1.00 [Eq. (3)]. If equal focus or attention was given to every structural component, the alignment score would be 1/23 = 0.043. Besides, the alignment scores vary across subjects for each dFNC state - structural component pair. Therefore, we show the mean alignments (thresholded at 0.056) across all subjects including HC and SZ in Fig. 5(A). States 1 and 2 where ICNs were sparsely connected had some similarity in their alignments, for example, both showed stronger associations with putamen and insula. On the other hand, state 3, 4, and 5 showed their associations with some of the structural components in the saliency and default mode networks [precuneus, PCC, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)], and in temporal cortex, in addition to the insula. In other words, the alignments for states 3,4, and 5 were more spread out than those for states 1 and 2, in addition to their regional differences across the brain.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28377, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The group differences in alignments are shown in Fig. 5(B) and Fig. 6.

An analysis on the patterns by k-means clustering resulted in two major types of patterns. Among five clusters (states), states 1 and 2 account for weaker connectivity within majority of ICNs and demonstrates no strong connectivity between subgroups (SC, AUD, VIS, SM, CC, DM, and CB). These are also the states wherein the patients with SZ made significantly more transitions than the HCs, suggesting a dysconnectivity in the SZ. Our translation-based multimodal fusion approach adds more information revealing possible linkage of these states (1 and 2) with some of the brain structures. In particular, these states have stronger associations with insula and putamen. Insula has been shown to have strong connection with aberrant activities in default mode and central executive networks in schizophrenic patients. It also shows more of gray matter volume loss in practically any other brain region in the patients with SZ. Parts of it along to circuits are concerned with distinguishing between stimuli coming from inside and outside the body, which gives it an obvious potential role in schizophrenia. Our findings of stronger associations between states 1(2) and insula are consistent with this finding as the states were significantly dwelled by the patients with SZ. On the other hand, states 3, 4, and 5 speaks for high to moderate correlations among the several ICNs, including regions in AUD, VIS, and SM. Interestingly, the HCs made more transitions in these states. With regard to their associations with the brain structures, significantly more alignments are revealed with the GMDs in precuneus, PCC, and temporal cortex. Furthermore, comparing alignment distributions across structural components, states 3, 4, and 5 seem to be more evenly spread out than the states 1 and 2. This is expected because many ICNs showed stronger functional connectivity in states 3, 4, and 5.

A strong positive correlation between attention and vigilance score and alignment of state 3 with middle temporal gyri, for the HCs, was revealed only when multimodal fusion was adopted. Neither of unimodal features indicated such relationship. Likewise, a strong negative correlation for the patients with SZ was found between their cognitive scores and alignments of state 5 with ACC, while unimodal features failed to provide such information. The positive correlation in the HCs and negative correlation in the patients suggest distinct structural-functional mechanisms, thereby demonstrate an interplay between deficits and dysfunction in the patients. The observed relationships are consistent and extends previous reports on structural-functional abnormalities in patients with SZ. Using a data-driven multimodal fusion approach, Michael showed significantly differing structure-function association in the ACC and temporal regions.
