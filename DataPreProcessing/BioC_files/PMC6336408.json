It is also important to stress that all participants were healthy adults, and that the levels of smoking and drinking exhibited were not directly associated with diagnoses of substance dependence, although they may be relevant to these disorders. Thus the effect size of this study involving the normal use of alcohol and cigarettes could be lower than in a case/control study. But the design of this study, use of individuals in the general population, enable this investigation to have impact on public health, since the use of substances for most of the smokers and drinkers was within a normal range, and we could identify these changes by the use of two large-scale datasets. Although the current study was based on the general population, the findings are in general consistent with previous studies based on clinical populations. For example, chronic nicotine exposure associated with lower functional connectivity was reported in a number of studies. In addition, many studies report that the orbitofrontal cortex, the key region identified in current study, play an important role in the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction. However, the results described here were obtained on populations from the general community, and do not necessarily apply to heavy smokers or drinkers. Moreover, we demonstrate with the IMAGEN dataset that the effect size is sufficient that there is a relation between the brain functional connectivities that we identify at age 14 and who will smoke at age 19. This is good evidence that the effects described in this paper are meaningful, in that the functional connectivity at age 14 can be related to what will happen in terms of smoking and drinking five years later. Additionally, we have removed several possible confounders that may distinguish the two groups, but it might be useful in future investigations to investigate the relation of depression to smoking and drinking. Another possible limitation is that impulsivity was assessed by delay discounting, and it would be of interest to examine the relation to other measures of impulsivity. Another possible area in which future research might extend the findings reported here is that we focused on the amount of drinking using the measure \u2018drinking amount per drinking day\u2019, as the relation between the frequency of drinking and the functional connectivity was complex. But this enables us to make an interesting point. The amount of alcohol consumed on a drinking day, the \u2018amount\u2019 measure, may well be related to how rewarding the consumption of the alcohol is. Once started on a drinking day, an individual in the High Amount drinking group tends to have more, and this is consistent with the reward value being high. That in turn is consistent with the higher functional connectivity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex found in the High Amount drinkers in this investigation, and with the evidence that the medial orbitofrontal cortex contains a representation of reward value. Another possible limitation of the drinking analysis is that the control group was a low drinking group rather than a non-drinker group. The reason for this choice was that only 55 participants did not drink any alcohol in the past 12 months, which would have resulted in too small a sample size.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50437, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As shown in Figure 4, most of the links were lower in the group that both smokes and drinks.

We interpret the smoking as being related to the increased impulsivity and decreased behavioral inhibition. In addition, smokers have globally lower\u00a0functional connectivity. A possible interpretation is that smokers may self-administer nicotine in order to increase brain functional connectivity and thereby attention and alertness. We also describe for the first time that drinkers have increased functional connectivity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, a reward area, and globally increased functional connectivity as well as impulsive behavior. An interpretation is that there is a role in drinking of increased reward sensitivity implemented in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. The increased impulsivity in drinkers may also be related to increased reward processing in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and its connected areas. These differences in functional connectivity may play a causal role, as shown by analyses showing that there was an association between smoking or drinking at age 19 and the functional connectivities at age 14 of individuals who at 14 are not smoking or drinking. In both smokers and drinkers, the increased impulsivity may exacerbate substance use. These findings open the way for further investigations of the extent to which these differences contribute to the substance use, or are caused by it. In any case, we note that there may be many factors that influence smoking and drinking, though we have revealed some of the possible underlying factors and brain mechanisms in this investigation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52422, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Materials and methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52444, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Participants and data preprocessing", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52480, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The dataset used for this investigation was selected from the November 2015 public data release from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, N\u00a0=\u00a0900), WU-Minn Consortium. Our sample includes 831 subjects (ages 22\u201335 years, 463 females) scanned on a 3 T Siemens connectome-Skyra scanner. The HCP consortium is a public shared large-scale neuroimaging dataset which aims to map macroscopic human brain circuits and their relationship to behavior in a large population of healthy adults and which has been widely used in neuroimaging studies. The sibships with individual having severe neurodevelopmental disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders or neurologic disorders were excluded, but individuals who are smokers, are overweight, or have a history of heavy drinking or recreational drug use without having experienced severe symptoms were included in HCP consortium. The details on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of HCP consortium were provided in the previous studies and the HCP website (https://www.humanconnectome.org/). It should be noted that the HCP dataset was not specifically designed for the study of substance use, but it is useful for investigating the impact of alcohol and cigarette use in a community sample. Two resting state fMRI acquisitions on different days were used. The four resting-state runs of approximately 15 min each were acquired in separate sessions on two different days, with eyes open with relaxed fixation on a projected bright cross-hair on a dark background. The WU-Minn HCP Consortium obtained full informed consent from all participants, and research procedures and ethical guidelines were followed in accordance with the Washington University Institutional Review Boards (IRB #201204036; Title: \u2018Mapping the Human Connectome: Structure, Function, and Heritability\u2019).

In this study, these minimally preprocessed images were further analyzed using FSL and AFNI. Briefly, first the constant, linear and quadratic trend were removed from these functional images. Next, several nuisance signals were regressed from the time course of each voxel using multiple linear regression, including cerebrospinal fluid signal, white matter signal, and Friston\u2019s 24 head motion parameters. Then, temporal band-pass filtering (0.01-0.1 Hz) was performed to reduce the influence of low-frequency drift and the high-frequency physiological noise. Finally, 3D spatial smoothing is applied to each volume of the fMRI data using a Gaussian kernel with Full-width at Half Maximum (FWHM) equaling to 4 mm. The first 50 volumes were discarded to suppress equilibration effects and participants without the full 1200 time points in four resting-state runs were also removed from the following analysis. Any data affected by head motion (mean framewise displacement larger than 0.3 mm) were excluded using the protocol of. The resulting time courses were used for the construction and analysis of the brain network. We also compared the findings based on the pipeline described above and elsewhere with alternative pipelines for data preprocessing including the HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline, and our pipeline but with global signal removal.

The names of the ROIs and their corresponding abbreviations are listed in Supplementary file 1. (This is a standard parcellation scheme, which provides a usable number of different divisions for statistical purposes when differences between regions are being investigated, and includes a useful parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex.). For comparison, we also provide the results (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2) based on another atlas which has also been validated in resting state fMRI studies, although its parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex is less good than the AAL2 atlas. The Pearson cross-correlations between all pairs of regional BOLD signals were calculated for each subject followed by z-transformation to improve normality, and the whole-brain functional connectivity network (94\u00a0\u00d7\u00a094 region-based network with 4371 links) was constructed. Finally, the mean functional connectivity across two scans (each scan containing left to right and right to left phase encoding directions) was used for the following analysis to provide a more reliable estimation of functional connectivity.

The main purpose of the current study was to investigate whether there were differences in functional connectivity that were related to smoking or drinking. Accordingly, in the initial analysis, we categorized the participants for the smoking analysis into two groups, one which used significant amounts of cigarettes, and the other using no or low amounts of cigarettes. The same was performed for the division into two groups with respect to the amount of alcohol drunk. In making the cutoff, we ensured that there were reasonable numbers of participants in the high and the low amount groups. After the initial analysis, we wished to investigate the effect of the different amounts of use of cigarettes or alcohol, and therefore used measures of the different amounts of drinking of each participant, and the number of times each participant had smoked, as described in the results section (Figures 5 and 6).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 64767, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Accordingly, to investigate smoking-associated functional connectivity, we divided all participants into three groups according to their smoking history (SSAGA_TB_Smoking_History), that\u00a0is non-smokers (417 participants), occasional smokers (161 participants) and regular smokers (203 participants). The non-smoker group contained participants who had never smoked during their lifetime. The occasional smoker group contained participants who experimented with cigarettes at least once in their lifetime but never became a regular smoker. The regular smoker group included those who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime and smoked at least one day per week when they were smoking regularly. (A score of 3 indicates a regular smoker; of 1 and 2 indicates an occasional smoker, and 0 a non-smoker.) In the main analyses described in this paper to investigate whether there was an effect of smoking, two of these groups were used, the non-smoker and regular smoker groups.

It should be noted that the \u2018amount\u2019 of drinking in the current study refers to the amount of drinks per drinking day (and not for example to the total number of drinks in the past 12 months). The rationale for the use of this measure is provided in the Discussion section, and a complementary analysis showed that there was a good correlation between the association pattern of the functional connectivities when the measures were the 'total drinks' and the 'drinks per drinking day' (r\u00a0=\u00a00.72, p<1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210).

Considering the purpose of this study described above and the sample size in each sub-group, we used a two sample t-test rather than a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 ANOVA. Then a Storey's FDR procedure was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Storey\u2019s FDR is a modification of FDR, also called positive False Discovery Rate (pFDR) by conditioning on one false positive finding having occurred. The Storey's FDR method was implemented by the Matlab function mafdr.m with default parameters. In the present study FDR correction for the functional connectivity between any pair of AAL2 regions was used, and the results for smoking are presented based on this statistical test with FDR p<0.005.

However, the 2\u00d72 ANOVA cannot control for the effect of the use of another substance very well since the control variables are binary, (i.e. low drinking and high drinking, rather than the exact drinks per drinking day). In addition, the 2\u00d72 ANOVA was used to test whether there are any differences between any two sub-groups (i.e. smoking vs. controls; drinking vs. controls; both smoking and drinking vs. controls; drinking vs. smoking; smoking vs. both smoking and drinking; drinking vs. both smoking and drinking;). But what we interested in is the drinking-related effect and the smoking-related effect, rather than all possible comparisons shown in a 2\u00d72 ANOVA model.
