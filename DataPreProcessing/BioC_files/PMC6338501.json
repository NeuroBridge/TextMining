Yet, it is unclear if tACS can modulate and restore neural oscillations that are reduced in patients with psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Here, we asked if tACS modulates network oscillations in schizophrenia. We performed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial to contrast tACS with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and sham stimulation in 22 schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations. We used high-density electroencephalography to investigate if a five-day, twice-daily 10HztACS protocol enhances alpha oscillations and modulates network dynamics that are reduced in schizophrenia. We found that 10Hz-tACS enhanced alpha oscillations and modulated functional connectivity in the alpha frequency band. In addition, 10Hz-tACS enhanced the 40Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which is reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Importantly, clinical improvement of auditory hallucinations correlated with enhancement of alpha oscillations and the 40Hz-ASSR.

Several psychiatric disorders have been associated impairment of neural oscillations. In particular, patients with schizophrenia exhibit reduced neural oscillations involved in sensory and cognitive processing. Therefore, strategies to target and modulate reduced neural oscillations may serve both as a tool to investigate the causal relationship between oscillation abnormalities and symptom manifestations and, ultimately, to therapeutic intervention to treat patients by restoring physiological oscillation dynamics. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation modality that applies oscillating electrical currents to the brain via scalp electrodes. A single session of tACS enhances posterior alpha oscillations (8\u201312 Hz) in healthy humans and its effects outlast stimulation for about an hour.

Further support for this model is provided by findings of reduced functional connections between these two brain regions. In addition, patients with schizophrenia exhibit abnormal neural oscillations. In particular, reduced alpha oscillations are directly associated with symptoms of schizophrenia (Merri vn and Floyd, 1992) and clinical improvement by antipsychotic medication such as clozapine is positively correlated with enhancement of alpha oscillations (Jin et al., 1995a, 1995b). In addition, resting-state alpha oscillations, which refer to fundamental network dynamics in the brain, are reduced in patients with schizophrenia. Importantly, one study found reduced functional connectivity in resting-state between the frontal and temporal lobes. Motivated by these findings, we hypothesized that applying 10Hz-tACS to the left frontal and temporal lobes of patients with schizophrenia may modulate reduced alpha oscillations and functional connections between the two regions.

Each participant was randomized to one of the three stimulation conditions (e.g. 1: sham, 2: tACS, 3: tDCS) with the 5-digit numbers. One of the co-authors in the study wrote MATLAB scripts to deliver and control stimulation waveforms with the three stimulation conditions.

The other two co-authors (study coordinators) performed all stimulation sessions with the 5-digit numbers for each participant. Further, the display on the stimulators was covered during stimulation to conceal information about the stimulation provided by the stimulators. All researchers were unaware of the condition assignments until all participants had completed the study. The auditory hallucination severity was measured by the auditory hallucination rating scale (AHRS). The AHRS was administered before the 1st stimulation on day 1 (baseline), after the 10th stimulation on day 5, and at the 1-week and 1-month follow-up study visits.

The electrode montage was identical for all three stimulation conditions to ensure blinding of the research personnel to each stimulation condition. We used two stimulators since the maximum current from one stimulator is 1.5mA zero-to-peak amplitude for the safety guidelines. We applied three rubber electrodes to the scalp with Ten20 conductive paste (Bio-Medical Instruments, Clinton Township, MI). Each stimulator has two output connectors for electrode cables. One of the two outputs of each stimulator was connected together to form a common return path for the stimulation current through a 5\u00d77cm electrode placed on Cz (center of the scalp). The other output of each stimulator was connected to a 5\u00d75cm electrode placed between F3 and Fp1 (DLPFC) and between T3 and P3 (TPJ), respectively. For 10Hz-tACS, each 5\u00d75cm electrode delivered an in-phase sinusoidal waveform with1mA amplitude. Both amplitude and phase of the stimulation waveforms were verified with an oscilloscope. For tDCS, the electrode between F3 and Fp1 delivered +2m A amplitude current and the other electrode between T3 and P3 delivered \u22122mA amplitude current.

First, resting-state EEG data with eyes-open and eyes-closed were recorded for eight minutes. Participants were instructed by a computer voice to fixate on a crosshair and open or close their eyes while staying relaxed. Eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions were alternated every two minutes and starting condition was randomized across the participants. We only present eyes-open data here since stimulation was applied in that state and we wanted to avoid confounds caused by the change in alpha oscillation strength due to eye closing. Second, the response to auditory click-trains was recorded. The auditory stimuli were delivered binaurally through air-conducting earphone tubes ER-3C (Etymotic Research Inc., Elk Grove Village, IL) at sound pressure level (SPL) of 90 dB. Participants fixated on a crosshair on a computer monitor while listening to 500ms long click-trains at rates of 10Hz, 20Hz, 30Hz, 40Hz and 80Hz. This task was 15 minutes in length, separated into five 3-minute blocks. Subsequent click-trains were separated by a jittered interval between 450ms and 550ms of silence. The order of the click-train frequencies was pseudo-random and balanced within each 3-minute block, for a total of 200 click-trains per block and a grand total of 1000 click-trains.

Second, the data were preprocessed by an artifact subspace reconstruction algorithm to identify high-variance data epochs and reconstruct missing data. Briefly, the algorithm first finds a minute of data that represents clean EEG signals that serve as a baseline. Then, principle component analysis is applied to the whole data set with a sliding window to find the subspaces in which there is activity that is more than five standard deviations away from the baseline EEG. Once the function has identified the outlier subspaces, it treats them as missing data and reconstructs their content using a mixing matrix that is calculated on the clean data. Third, bad channels that were found in the previous step were interpolated and common average referencing was performed. After then, infomax independent component analysis (ICA) was performed to remove eye blinking, eye movement, muscle activity, and heartbeat artefact.

From our study about clinical results, we found the highest effect size in the tACS condition at day 5 for AHRS (Fig. S5). Specifically, we asked how much the enhancement was correlated with changes in auditory hallucination symptoms measured by the AHRS. We calculated the Spearm an\u2019s rho between AHRS scores and alpha oscillation power from all participants at each EEG channel on the scalp. We chose AHRS and EEG from day 1 of stimulation as a baseline and calculated changes from this baseline (AHRS: difference in raw score; alpha oscillations: modulation index). We found areas of significant, strong negative and positive correlation coefficients in the left tem poroparietal/frontal and in the central region in the tACS condition on day 5, respectively (Fig. 6A: Topographical correlation map with significant channels (p<0.05) with FDR correction). Negative correlation coefficients indicate that the decrease of auditory hallucination symptoms was associated with an increase in alpha oscillation power. Scatter plots for the negative and positive correlations in the topographies are presented (Fig. S6). For both the 1-week and 1-month follow-up sessions, we observed weaker correlations that did not reach statistical significance (Fig. S7). These results suggest that changes of alpha oscillation power and auditory hallucinations are correlated in specific regions in the brain. Importantly, this relationship was strongest at the location of the stimulation electrodes. Second, we investigated the relationship between changes in AHRS and the 40Hz-ASSR. We calculated the Spearman\u2019s rho between changes in the AHRS and the 40Hz-ASSR across all participants (Fig. 6B). We found significant negative correlations over the central region (p<0.05 with FDR correction) in the tACS condition on day 5 of stimulation. A scatter plot for the negative correlations is presented (Fig. S6). Thus, the reduction in auditory hallucination symptoms was accompanied by an increase in the 40Hz-ASSR over the central region, which is activated region of the 40Hz-ASSR. No significant correlations were obtained for the follow-up sessions (Fig. S8).

However, the effect of tACS on reduced neural oscillations in patients with psychiatric disorders was unknown. To address this question, we performed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial that compared 10Hz-tACS to tDCS and sham stimulation in patients with schizophrenia experiencing persistent auditory hallucinations. We applied 10Hz-tACS to target reduced alpha oscillations to determine target engagement in terms of modulation of cortical oscillations measured by high-density EEG. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that 10Hz-tACS enhanced alpha oscillations and modulated functional connectivity. In addition, 10Hz-tACS enhanced the 40Hz-ASSR, which is reduced in schizophrenia and associated with auditory processing deficits. The enhanced alpha oscillations and 40Hz-ASSR were correlated with reduction of auditory hallucinations for specific brain regions.

We chose to target alpha oscillations instead since (1) previous studies reported reduced alpha oscillations in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy participants and (2) we hypothesized that auditory hallucinations are the consequence of reduced functional connectivity in the fronto-parietal-temporal network. To our knowledge, the study presented here is the first study to examine a tACS paradigm for a psychiatric indication. Our stimulation protocol comprised 10 stimulation sessions with a total stimulation duration of 200 minutes. Previous investigations of target engagement of alpha oscillations by tACS have been limited to healthy control participants that received a single dose of tACS with typically lower stimulation amplitudes than what we used. Several but not all studies showed that such a stimulation session could enhance alpha oscillations during and immediately after stimulation. No previous study has investigated longer-lasting effects on the time-scale of weeks as in our study. Although grand-averaged outlasting effects after one week did not reach significance, some participants with more persistent clinical improvement yielded outlasting effects on neural oscillations up to the final 1-month follow-up after 10HztACS (Fig. S9). In addition, individual alpha frequency at baseline may be an indicator of inter-participant variability to outlasting effects but we could not find any relationship between individual alpha frequency and outcome measures (alpha power, ASSR, and AHRS).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32167, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Steady-state evoked potentials are a fundamental neural response to a temporally modulated stimulus in frequency and phase.

First, the number of participants per condition is rather small. For this reason, clinical improvement did not reach statistical significance. However, effect size for the AHRS is the greatest in the tACS condition. Furthermore, the focus of the study was to identify target engagement for auditory hallucinations. In other words, changes in brain network dynamics in response to tACS appear to be a helpful tool to track the therapeutic effect of stimulation. A follow-up study with larger sample size will provide the basis to address this question. Second, average participant age differed between the conditions (p=0.01, Table S2). In contrast, we assessed Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and found no significant differences (p=0.10) in BACS scores at baseline between the groups. Although this point there is no known mechanism of how age affects the response to brain stimulation in patients with schizophrenia, this will need to be further investigated in future studies. Third, we did not collect EEG data during stimulation due to the pronounced stimulation artefact. Although several previous studies investigated mathematical methods to remove these artifacts using principle component analysis or a beamformer algorithm, successful and complete removal of the artifacts without distortion of the signals of interest remains to be demonstrated. Lastly, we examined global functional connectivity on the scalp channel pairs. This choice was motivated by our hypothesis that 10Hz-tACS not only enhances reduced alpha oscillations but also modulates disrupted network connections between brain regions. For this reason, we calculated functional connectivity across frequency and found the strongest connections are shifted to 10Hz in the tACS condition. We adopted global functional connectivity by averaging all scalp channels to minimize spurious local functional connectivity since the activity of a single source in the brain is measureable in many EEG channels and one EEG channel is likely averaged activity from multiple brain sources. In addition, different EEG channel locations across participants could hinder to obtain consistent local connectivity. We are now conducting a follow-up study with an individual MRI and individually digitized EEG locations for each participant thus this may enable us to obtain precise functional connectivity by source reconstruction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35691, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we report successful target engagement of alpha oscillations by tACS in psychiatric patients.
