In particular, the onset of the illness is associated with aberrant functional integration between the medio-dorsal thalamic nucleus (MDN) and widespread prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortical regions. Because the thalamus is also implicated in other psychiatric illnesses including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the diagnostic specificity of these alterations is unclear. Here, we determined whether aberrant functional integration between the MDN and the cortex is a specific feature of schizophrenia or a trans-diagnostic feature of psychiatric illness. Effective connectivity (EC) between the MDN and rest of the cortex was measured by applying psychophysiological interaction analysis to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 50 patients with first episode schizophrenia (FES), 50 patients with MDD, 50 patients with PTSD and 122 healthy controls. All participants were medication-na\u00efve. The only significant schizophrenia-specific effect was increased EC between the right MDN and the right pallidum (p\u2009<\u20090.05 corrected). In contrast, there were a number of significant trans-diagnostic alterations, with both right and left MDN displaying trans-diagnostic increased EC with several prefrontal and parietal regions bilaterally (p\u2009<\u20090.05 corrected). EC alterations between the MDN and the cortex are not specific to schizophrenia but are a trans-diagnostic feature of psychiatric disorders, consistent with emerging conceptualizations of mental illness based on a single general psychopathology factor.

Over the past two decades, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) have allowed the investigation of the neurobiological alterations underlying this disease in vivo. These studies have revealed widespread alterations within cortical-subcortical-cerebellar networks, and in particular have identified the thalamus as a key structure implicated in the onset and progression of the illness. Within this region, the medio-dorsal thalamic nucleus (MDN) has received particular attention due to its prominent connections to the prefrontal cortex, a region known to be implicated in the illness.

Firstly, we cannot exclude the possibility that the increased EC between the right MDN and the right pallidum that we report as a distinctive feature of schizophrenia may be expressed in other psychiatric groups not included here. For example, a recent investigation reported divergent patterns of thalamocortical dysconnectivity in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, a direct comparison with our findings is difficult due to major methodological differences between the two studies. For example, we focussed on a specific nucleus of the thalamus (the MDN) whereas Sk\u00e5tun and colleagues examined ten sub-sections of the thalamus that were identified using independent component analysis rather than pre-existing neuroanatomical knowledge. Furthermore we examined drug-na\u00efve patients with a first episode of the illness, whereas Sk\u00e5tun and colleagues recruited medicated patients who had been ill for an average of 5.8 years (for schizophrenia) and 9.9 years (for bipolar disorder). Secondly, although we can exclude medication as a potential confound, there are other sources of neurofunctional variability such as IQ and socio-economic status that were not monitored and might have contributed to the differences between patients and controls. We also note that there were demographic differences amongst clinical groups\u2014for example the PTSD participants came from rural rather than urban areas and were older than the other groups. These differences however cannot account for our main finding, i.e., the presence of trans-diagnostic EC alterations between the MDN and the cortex in all clinical groups. Thirdly, because the data were acquired using a cross-sectional rather than a longitudinal design, it was not possible to distinguish between correlates of illness vulnerability and correlates of illness onset.
