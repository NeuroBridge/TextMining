The present study aims to disentangle the separate and interacting effects of stimulant drug use and pre-existing familial risk on abnormal reward processing associated with stimulant drug addiction. We used the Monetary Incentive Delay task, a well-validated measure of reward processing, during fMRI scanning in four distinct groups: individuals with familial risk who were either stimulant drug-dependent (N\u2009=\u200941) or had never used stimulant drugs (N\u2009=\u200946); and individuals without familial risk who were either using stimulant drugs (N\u2009=\u200925) or not (N\u2009=\u200948). We first examined task-related whole-brain activation followed by a psychophysiological interaction analysis to further explore brain functional connectivity. For analyses, we used a univariate model with two fixed factors (familial risk and stimulant drug use). Our results showed increased task-related activation in the putamen and motor cortex of stimulant-using participants. We also found altered task-related functional connectivity between the putamen and frontal regions in participants with a familial risk (irrespective of whether they were using stimulant drugs or not). Additionally, we identified an interaction between stimulant drug use and familial risk in task-related functional connectivity between the putamen and motor-related cortical regions in potentially at-risk individuals. Our findings suggest that abnormal task-related activation in motor brain systems is associated with regular stimulant drug use, whereas abnormal task-related functional connectivity in frontostriatal brain systems, in individuals with familial risk, may indicate pre-existing neural vulnerability for developing addiction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1958, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1971, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A change in our understanding of drug addiction as a brain disorder was influenced by the notion that drug addiction was not a deficit of character, but rather the result of aberrant brain function caused by excessive drug use.

The brain reward system assimilates both top-down and bottom-up inputs from cortical and subcortical brain circuitry, including prefrontal and motor cortical systems, to support the integrated evaluation of environmental stimuli.

Familial transmission of substance use disorders suggests pre-existing genetic, sociological, economic, and other environmental risk factors that are often shared between biological first-degree relatives (i.e., familial risk-factors). Accordingly, healthy first-degree relatives of individuals affected by addiction report a number of abnormalities in terms of personality traits and brain structure, aberrant striatal dopamine neurotransmission, and altered striatal function during reward processing. Thus, pre-existing familial vulnerability renders the individual vulnerable to developing addiction should they start taking drugs.

This endophenotype approach has been used previously in addicted populations, although not in relation to reward processing. To identify effects of stimulant drug use as well as the familial risk of addiction within the same model, we included non-dependent stimulant drug users and non-drug users, both without familial risk, in addition to the sibling pairs with familial risk.

Together, our findings indicate that the two risk factors associated with stimulant drug use, i.e., familial and stimulant-related risk, are reflected by distinct functional brain changes during reward anticipation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34225, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Effects of stimulant drug use on reward processing", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34276, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although stimulant drug use was associated with differences in brain activation, it had no behaviorally measurable effects on MID-task performance. There are several approaches to interpreting neuroimaging findings not reflected in behavioral task performance. Given that the MID-task was designed to preclude behavioral differences, our findings may suggest underlying cognitive abnormalities that cannot be attributed to non-specific performance measures. At a neural level, during an anticipatory period preceding a correct response, we identified in stimulant drug users compared with non-drug users, significantly increased task-related brain activation in the putamen and motor cortex (Fig. 3b)\u2014brain regions implicated in motor response. Such activations in motor pathways during MID-task performance and cue-reactivity have been frequently reported in published work, and are unsurprising given converging lines of evidence demonstrating the activation and alteration of motor-related brain regions by stimulant drugs. Given that increased activation in motor pathways has been linked to stimulant drug-induced sensitization and underlying progressive recruitment of sensorimotor and dorsal striatal regions in stimulant drug users (an effect shown to persist for several months following stimulant drug exposure), it is tempting to speculate that increased activation seen in stimulant-using individuals in the current study might reflect enhanced ventral-to-dorsal progression of striatal recruitment facilitated by stimulant drugs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35819, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In light of previous reports on striatal function during the MID-task, we predicted blunted ventral striatal activation in stimulant drug users.

It is noteworthy that task-related differences in ventral striatal activation following stimulant abuse have not been consistently reported, which may be due to variations in sample characteristics and experimental design such as the recency of drug use.

These observations strongly suggest that the putamen, in addition to being a motor structure, is involved in higher-level cognitive functions. In particular, the OFC, mPFC, and ACC have been implicated in an inhibition network consisting of cortical motor regions and basal ganglia structures, including the putamen.

Potential resilience, in the form of low sensation-seeking traits, has been previously reported in unaffected siblings, which may reflect lack of motivation to initiate drug use. In previous studies, individuals with familial risk demonstrated increased striatal functional connectivity strength to attention- and motor-related structures, including the precentral and postcentral gyri, during reward anticipation. However, such studies were unable to determine whether such changes represented addiction risk or resilience. Here we provide additional evidence that functional connectivity strength between striatal regions and motor-related structures when anticipating a reward may represent a mechanism for resilience in individuals with either familial risk or risks associated with the use of stimulants.

We also acknowledge that stimulant drug users were separated based on their familial risk, yet familial risk is only one, albeit important, risk factor for the development of addiction. Other possible risk factors may encompass neurobiological or socioeconomic differences that may exist between dependent and non-dependent stimulant drug users, rendering some individuals more vulnerable to developing addiction than others.

Embedding the emerging knowledge of neurobiological vulnerability factors that are shared between family members into family-based interventions may increase therapeutic efficacy, perhaps by facilitating the delivery of prevention and intervention programs during childhood and adolescence. Of particular relevance, we identified altered corticostriatal pathways as a candidate endophenotype for stimulant drug addiction.
