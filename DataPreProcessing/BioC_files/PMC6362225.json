The clinical-staging model is a refined form of diagnosis that places the patient along a continuum of illness conditions, which allows stage-specific interventions with the potential of improving patient care and outcome. This cross-sectional study investigates brain connectivity features that characterize the clinical stages following a first psychotic episode. Structural brain networks were derived from diffusion-weighted MRI for 71 early-psychosis patients and 76 healthy controls. Patients were classified into stage II (first-episode), IIIa (incomplete remission), IIIb (one relapse), and IIIc (two or more relapses), according to the course of the illness until the time of scanning. Brain connectivity measures and diffusion parameters (fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient) were investigated using general linear models and sparse linear discriminant analysis (sLDA), studying distinct subgroups of patients who were at specific stages of early psychosis. We found that brain connectivity impairments were more severe in clinical stages following the first-psychosis episode (stages IIIa, IIIb, IIIc) than in first-episode psychosis (stage II) patients. These alterations were spatially diffuse but converged on a set of vulnerable regions, whose inter-connectivity selectively correlated with processing speed in patients and controls. The sLDA suggested that relapsing-remitting (stages IIIb, IIIc) and non-remitting (stage IIIa) patients are characterized by distinct dysconnectivity profiles. Our results indicate that neuroimaging markers of brain dysconnectivity in early psychosis may reflect the heterogeneity of the illness and provide a connectomics signature of the clinical-staging model.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1991, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2004, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, are characterized by heterogeneity in terms of etiopathology, clinical presentation and outcome. Although the outcome after a first episode of psychosis is better than traditionally thought, relapses within 5 years from the initial episode are up to 80%. Current definitions of psychotic illnesses are mainly based on relatively short-term evaluations and only poorly consider the long-term, potentially progressive evolution of the illness. Clinical staging, which has proven useful in somatic medicine, is an alternative approach, which captures the degree of disease progression in a given patient and places the person along the continuum of the course of illness. Introduced to psychiatry by Fava and Kellner, clinical staging was developed and applied to psychotic disorders by McGorry and collegues. This approach allows to distinguish earlier and more benign states from more chronic states, with the aim of selecting the right treatment according to the clinical stage. As a framework, it has proven to be useful in the implementation of early intervention in psychosis by distinguishing an ultra-high risk phase from first-episode and chronic phases. Mapping neurobiological markers, such as brain imaging features, onto clinical stages could further allow us to refine the model and validate the boundaries of the clinical groups, thus broadening our understanding of psychotic disorder pathophysiology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3465, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Abnormalities in white matter (WM) and structural brain connectivity are well documented in schizophrenia and have been related to the expression of clinical symptoms, cognitive deficits and differential functional outcome.

From a whole-brain connectivity (or connectome) perspective, patients present a less efficient brain-network organization and a decentralization of core brain regions and hubs, which are important in maintaining proper information integration underlying cognitive functions in the brain. Individuals in the early stages of psychosis appear to have less consistent WM (as well as grey matter (GM)) changes than chronic patients. This observation has led to the hypothesis that there might be a progression or a differentiation of brain connectivity impairments across stages and over the course of the illness from prodromal symptoms to the first-episode of psychosis and, finally, to the relapsing and chronic phases. Not all patients necessarily progress from one stage to another, which adds complexity to the model. Only a few studies have looked at the early phases after a first episode of psychosis, or compared a first episode with multiple episodes or with non-remitting patients. Indeed, there is a 5-year period following the first psychotic episode, called the \u2018critical period' by Birchwood and colleagues, during which the most severe brain changes appear to occur.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5281, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The objective of the present work is to investigate brain connectomes of early psychosis patients classified in different stages (i.e., stage II, IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc) according to their clinical profiles.

Alterations in NOS, gFA and ADC are compatible with neurobiological processes that have been associated with schizophrenia, such as neuroinflammation, myelin impairment and loss of tissue volume. It has been suggested that oxidative stress is an important risk factor for developing schizophrenia. Redox dysregulation interacts with neuroinflammation and glutamatergic hypofunction to impair oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. In early psychosis, WM gFA values relate to brain concentrations of glutathione, a fundamental antioxidant that prevents oxidative stress and oligodendrocytes sufferance. Elevated ADC values have been directly associated with demyelination processes in animal models with myelin deficiency, and both gFA and ADC impairments in schizophrenia have been related to deficits in the density or myelination of axonal fibers. In schizophrenia, NOS-connectivity relates to cytoarchitectonic abnormalities of pyramidal neurons, which are centrally implicated in the disorder. In this study, we found that NOS-connectivity bears the largest effect for progressive connectivity changes across psychosis stages.

A second complementary explanation is that different clinical subtypes can experience different spatio-temporal patterns of WM alteration. For example, it is plausible that an early-psychosis patient with a non-remitting course of illness could present a different or more severe dysconnectivity pattern than a relapsing-remitting patient, with duration of illness being equal. A large longitudinal study on first-episode schizophrenia found that individuals with extended periods of relapse had more severe brain-tissue atrophy compared to brief- or no-relapse conditions, while GM-volume alterations measured at the time of the first psychotic episode partially predicted the course of psychosis into continuous or remitting illness. Moreover, WM-changes detected after a first psychotic episode can partially reverse with the remission of acute psychotic symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34285, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To investigate whether different early-psychosis clinical subtypes are associated with distinct WM-connectivity patterns, we performed an exploratory sparse linear discriminant analysis (sLDA) on nodal connectivity-strength values. Our analysis suggests that distinct brain connectivity features characterize the clinical stages and identifies axes of pathological evolution in terms of both (cross-sectional) temporal progression (qualitatively, 1st and 3rd LDDs (Fig. 4a), with patients\u2019 scores along these dimensions correlating with the duration of illness) and clinical differentiation in terms of relapsing-remitting or non-remitting pathology (2nd LDD, Fig. 4a).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34955, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It should be noted that additional factors that were not accounted for in our analyses, such as diagnostic heterogeneity, number of relapses and differential longitudinal follow-up, could blur the boundaries of the clinical groups (stages II, IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc) and the corresponding neuroimaging markers. Our data are cross-sectional and it is not possible to foresee the pathological evolution of single individuals. In addition, our sample-size is relatively small, which limits the statistical power and the generalizability of our exploratory sLDA analysis to a classification or predictive setting. Finally, although no relationship was found between brain-connectivity measures and antipsychotic dose, and no differences in CPZ equivalents were found between patient subgroups, possible iatrogenic or other secondary effects on the reported neuroimaging measures cannot be completely excluded. While some studies have shown that medication can negatively impact WM connectivity, others found no effect, and this aspect should be further assessed in future research.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36031, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, our work shows that neuroimaging markers of brain dysconnectivity and core-network decentralization are more severe in more advanced early-psychosis stages and typify relapsing-remitting and non-remitting clinical profiles, thus providing a connectomics perspective of the clinical-staging model. Based on these results, we expect that the investigation of large datasets (including stage-I and stage-IV individuals), the inclusion of additional clinical, neurobiological and multimodal brain-connectivity features, and longitudinal designs combined with machine learning approaches will significantly contribute to model and understand the unfolding of psychosis-spectrum disorders across clinical stages.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36753, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary information", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36779, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Publisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36916, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "These authors contributed equally: A.
