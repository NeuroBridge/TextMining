Here we assessed the effect of expectation on methylphenidate (MP)-induced striatal DA changes in 23 participants with an active cocaine use disorder (CUD) and 23 healthy controls (HC) using [11C]raclopride and PET both after placebo (PL) and after MP (0.5\u2009mg/kg, i.v.). Brain dopamine D2 and D3 receptor availability (D2R: non-displaceable binding potential (BPND)) was measured under four conditions in randomized order: (1) expecting PL/receiving PL, (2) expecting PL/receiving MP, (3) expecting MP/receiving PL, and (4) expecting MP/receiving MP. Expecting MP increased pulse rate compared to expecting PL. Receiving MP decreased D2R in striatum compared to PL, indicating MP-induced striatal DA release, and this effect was significantly blunted in CUD versus HC consistent with prior findings of decreased striatal dopamine responses both in active and detoxified CUD. There was a group\u2009\u00d7\u2009challenge\u2009\u00d7\u2009expectation effect in caudate and midbrain, with expectation of MP increasing MP-induced DA release in HC but not in CUD, and expectation of PL showing a trend to increase MP-induced DA release in CUD but not in HC. These results are consistent with the role of DA in reward prediction error in the human brain: decreasing DA signaling when rewards are less than expected (blunted DA increases to MP in CUD) and increasing them when greater than expected (for PL in CUD reflecting conditioned responses to injection). Our findings also document disruption of the expectation of drug effects in dopamine signaling in participants with CUD compared to non-addicted individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1823, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1836, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There is growing evidence that the context under which a drug is administered can affect the behavioral, physiological, and the neurochemical response to the drug. For example, the response to drugs of abuse is affected by expectation, which in turn is sensitive to prior drug experiences. This is modulated in part by dopamine (DA), which is a neurotransmitter involved with reward and expectation of reward. Animal studies have shown that expectation affects the responses to drugs of abuse. For example, cocaine-induced increases in DA and its behavioral effects are greater when animals receive the drug in an environment where they expect it than when they do not or when they self-administer it than when it is administered by the investigator. Similarly, in human cocaine abusers the behavioral and regional brain metabolic responses to stimulants have been shown to be stronger when stimulants are expected versus when placebo (PL) is expected. The dopaminergic system has also been shown to be involved in the PL-induced expectation of therapeutic benefit including analgesia. Similarly, the involvement of the dopaminergic response has been documented for PL responses in Parkinson\u2019s disease: both to medications and to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. That is, patients who responded to PL (reporting clinical improvement) had greater DA release in the striatum than those who did not.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3246, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We have studied the effects of expectation on the effects of the stimulant drug methylphenidate (MP) on regional brain glucose metabolism and on behavior. MP, like cocaine, increases DA by blocking DA transporters (DATs); hence, its effects are a function of the level of DAT blockade and the rate of DA release (reflects DA cell activity). In healthy volunteers, we showed that the expectation of receiving MP while receiving PL significantly activated brain glucose metabolism in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 25), and effects were strongest in subjects who, because of experimental randomization, had not experienced MP before. These results corroborated the involvement of the NAc and the ventral cingulate in processing expectation for \u201cuncertain drug effects.\u201d However, the extent to which these regional changes reflect the involvement of DA in processing expectation of drug effects rather than non dopaminergic signaling (i.e glutamatergic signaling) needs further investigation. Understanding the neuronal signals underlying expectation responses in addiction and specifically that of DA could help guide development of targeted pharmacotherapeutic interventions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4462, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Further, the characterization of how expectation influences drug responses in non-addicted and addicted individuals might also help guide prevention interventions. Indeed, while expectations might differently impact the effects of drugs of abuse in controls and in addicted individuals due to conditioning, there is also evidence that they might be influenced by genetics. For example, a recent study showed that individuals with family history of alcoholism showed stronger striatal DA release when expecting to receive alcohol, suggesting that genetics influence the sensitivity to expectation; although surprisingly these responses did not differ between controls and alcohol use disorder (AUD) participants. Inasmuch as drug-induced DA increases trigger conditioning to the drug and its cues, one would have predicted that in addicted individuals the expectation effects on DA signaling would be stronger than in controls. However, once conditioning occurs, DA neurons stop firing upon receipt of the reward and instead fire when exposed to the conditioned cues (that predict the reward) or to an unexpected larger reward, whereas they inhibit their firing when the experience of the reward does not materialize or is less than expected. Therefore, it is likely that the differences in DA responses between addicted and non-addicted individuals will depend on whether the expectation is for PL versus stimulant drugs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5884, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To test this possibility, we studied 23 subjects with active cocaine use disorder (CUD) and 23 healthy non-drug- dependent control subjects (HC) with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and [11C]raclopride, a DA D2/D3 receptor (D2R) ligand that is sensitive to competition with endogenous DA.

We hypothesized that expectation of receiving the drug would increase DA release in striatum (i.e., lower D2R availability) when compared with unexpected and that because of conditioning in CUD we hypothesized that the difference from expectation (expected MP versus unexpected MP) would be greater in CUD than in HC in line with our previous findings that expectation of MP increased brain glucose metabolism in CUD versus HC, even though the overall dopaminergic effects of MP would be greater in HC than in CUD regardless of condition. However, we also considered the possibility that, because participants with a CUD would have attenuated DA increases when given MP, they would show a lower than expected reward resulting in inhibition of DA neuronal firing, whereas the expectation of receiving PL and instead receiving MP in CUD would lead to a greater than expected reward signal and hence greater DA neuronal firing than in controls.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7338, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7346, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Subjects", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7355, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "Characteristics of the study participants", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7397, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table", "xml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th/><th>CUD (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u200923)</th><th>HC (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u200923)</th><th>\n<italic>p</italic> Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age (years)</td><td>44.1 (3.6)</td><td>42.1 (4.1)</td><td>ns</td></tr><tr><td>Years of education</td><td>13.2 (5.7)</td><td>14.7 (2.8)</td><td>ns</td></tr><tr><td>Verbal IQ Barona</td><td>97.0 (11.9)</td><td>97.8 (13.6)</td><td>ns</td></tr><tr><td>BMI</td><td>26.4 (5.0)</td><td>26.4 (2.3)</td><td>ns</td></tr><tr><td>Cigarette (pack years)</td><td>8.8 (5.6)</td><td>0.5 (1.9)</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>Cocaine age</td><td>21.9 (5.8)</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Cocaine use (g/day)</td><td>3.5 (2.8)</td><td>0</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>Cocaine use (years)</td><td>18.4 (7.2)</td><td>0</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>BDI</td><td>10.4 (11.3)</td><td>2.1 (2.6)<sup>a</sup></td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td>MPQ PEM</td><td>44.2 (9.3)</td><td>51.9 (9.9)</td><td>0.010</td></tr><tr><td>MPQ NEM</td><td>19.5 (11.5)</td><td>8.4 (7.0)</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>MPQ constraint</td><td>49.1 (7.9)</td><td>55.6 (8.4)</td><td>0.010</td></tr></tbody></table>\n"}, "text": "\tCUD (n\u2009=\u200923)\tHC (n\u2009=\u200923)\tp Value\t \tAge (years)\t44.1 (3.6)\t42.1 (4.1)\tns\t \tYears of education\t13.2 (5.7)\t14.7 (2.8)\tns\t \tVerbal IQ Barona\t97.0 (11.9)\t97.8 (13.6)\tns\t \tBMI\t26.4 (5.0)\t26.4 (2.3)\tns\t \tCigarette (pack years)\t8.8 (5.6)\t0.5 (1.9)\t<0.0001\t \tCocaine age\t21.9 (5.8)\tNA\tNA\t \tCocaine use (g/day)\t3.5 (2.8)\t0\t<0.0001\t \tCocaine use (years)\t18.4 (7.2)\t0\t<0.0001\t \tBDI\t10.4 (11.3)\t2.1 (2.6)a\t0.002\t \tMPQ PEM\t44.2 (9.3)\t51.9 (9.9)\t0.010\t \tMPQ NEM\t19.5 (11.5)\t8.4 (7.0)\t<0.0001\t \tMPQ constraint\t49.1 (7.9)\t55.6 (8.4)\t0.010\t \t", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7923, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_foot"}, "text": "BDI Beck\u2019s depression inventory, BMI body mass index, cigarette (pack years) (number of cigarettes per day\u2009\u00d7\u2009years of smoking)/20, with 20 being the size of a common pack of cigarettes, CUD cocaine use disorder, HC healthy controls, MPQ multidimensional personality questionnaire, PEM positive emotionality, NEM negative emotionality, NA not applicable, ns not significant", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8296, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_foot"}, "text": "an\u2009=\u200921", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8304, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The Institutional Review Boards at the Stony Brook University/Brookhaven National Laboratory approved the protocol.

This finding was contrary to our hypothesis that CUD would show conditioned responses to expectation of MP hence an amplified effect, similar to our previous study in which we showed overall elevated brain glucose metabolism responses to expectation of MP in CUD versus HC. This discrepancy is likely to reflect the fact that brain glucose metabolic responses reflect not just DA effects but also downstream DA responses as well as non-DA responses implicated in conditions (i.e., glutamatergic modulation).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27673, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The DA system is critical for signaling expectation of rewards and for motivating behaviors needed to achieve the reward. DA neurons in midbrain initially respond to unexpected primary rewards and with repeated exposure eventually to the stimuli that predict those rewards. The anticipation of a rewarding outcome is often inferred based on activation in striatal regions, including caudate, putamen, NAc, and in ventral cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Neurons in the midbrain code for a breach in expectation (i.e., prediction error). The activation is associated with a distributed network involved in detecting, signaling, and adjusting behavior and expectations toward violated prediction. Caudate neurons have been shown to participate in feature-based anticipation of visual information that predicts reward. Caudate neurons fire not only before the onset of an expected target but also in preparatory responding to signals that predict reward. When predictions are violated, caudate activity attenuates over the course of learning. Once the rules have been established, breaches of expectation diminish and so does the caudate activity. The caudate signals for the occurrence of events that violate the predictions. This signal is not due to the perception of salient events or the need to change one\u2019s behavior. Thus one interpretation of our findings is that in CUD the blunted DA and self-reported responses to MP was coded as an omission of reward that led to decrease DA cell firing and reduced DA release in caudate and midbrain consistent with the role of DA encoding for reward prediction error. That is, DA neurons are activated when the reward is larger than predicted, whereas they are inhibited when the reward is less than predicted. This could also explain why an unexpected signal with PL might have led to increased DA release in CUD who might have responded to conditioning to the act of injection, which would have not been the case for HC. Moreover, recent studies in healthy adults showed that MP decreased midbrain connectivity with the putamen.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29753, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous PET studies in healthy volunteers have shown that the expectation of stimulant drugs (e.g., MP, amphetamine, and caffeine), without active drug administration, is associated with dopaminergic PL effects, including D2R reductions in the striatum and thalamus. Moreover, PL analgesia has also shown increased striatal and extra-striatal dopaminergic responses under the expectation of analgesia in various studies with human pain models, and patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease who clinically responded to PL treatment showed greater striatal DA release compared to non-responders. A recent [11C]raclopride study compared dopaminergic responses to alcohol and PL beverages in AUD patients and in healthy participants with and without a family history of AUD. They found a drink order-by-group interaction such that the family history positive group who received PL first had lower PL BP and lower difference between PL and alcohol BP, which was in line with their subjective expectation of alcohol evoking DA release. Moreover, in tobacco smokers, the belief of \u201cabsence of nicotine in a cigarette\u201d compared to \u201cpresence of nicotine in a cigarette\u201d diminished neural blood oxygen-level-dependent responses in the ventral striatum to value and reward prediction errors and reduced its impact on smokers\u2019 choices. However, the evidence for the conditioned DA responses to the expectation of drugs of abuse in drug abusers is scarce, and we based our hypothesis mainly on a previous brain glucose metabolism study in CUD and to brain cue reactivity experiments in which CUD show conditioned limbic responses to cocaine cues. Potentially, our unexpected findings of blunted DA effects of MP expectation in CUD are due to the administration of MP. MP is a psychostimulant drug that, similarly to cocaine, increases DA by blocking DATs, and it is distinct from cocaine in its route of administration (iv injection (MP) versus smoking (cocaine)) and drug effects.

Large and fast increases of DA mimic natural phasic increases in DA release, which are related to reward and salience.

In our study, however, expected DA release did not correlate with self-report ratings.

Also, while in caudate and putamen D2R availability predominantly reflects D2 receptors, in NAc and midbrain they reflect both D2 and D3 receptors. In CUD, there is evidence that D2R are downregulated, whereas D3 receptors might be upregulated, and this therefore confounds the interpretation of our findings. Another limitation of the study is that CUD consisted of more smokers (n\u2009=\u200920 current smokers) than the HC group (n\u2009=\u20093 current smokers), and group findings may be in part due to group differences in smoking. However, an exploratory analysis of main effects of Challenge in striatal areas (NAc, caudate, putamen), for which we hypothesized blunted DA release in smokers, did not reveal a significant effect of smoking status (p\u2009>\u20090.05; corrected for CUD Group). Effects of tobacco smoking on stimulant-induced DA release may not be as strong compared to that of CUD. Since CUD is more prevalent in males than in females, recruitment for females was harder than for males, and we matched four women CUD with four HC in our dataset. Haltia et al. found that iv PL with the expectation of receiving glucose lead to decreased ventral striatal D2R (and increased D2R binding in the dorsal striatum) in men but not in women, suggesting gender differences in DA function after pharmacological challenge. An exploratory analysis revealed no gender effect on striatal DA release in NAc and caudate (p\u2009>\u20090.05; corrected for CUD Group). Additionally, although we used a full factorial design of Expectation (PL/MP)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Drug Challenge (PL/MP), which is the golden standard for a PL design, we have not systematically tested whether the deception was successful by asking participants after their scans how certain they were about their drug expectation. Therefore, group differences in sensitivity to deception may have played a role in the outcome. Nevertheless, if a Group effect in deception was indeed present this would be an effect consistent over all four conditions and corrected by the factorial model.
