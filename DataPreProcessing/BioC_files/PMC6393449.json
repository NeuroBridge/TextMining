However, the neural underpinnings of neuropsychological impairment remain to be fully elucidated. Data of 59 schizophrenia patients and 72 healthy controls from a public resting-state fMRI database was employed in our study. Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Battery was used to measure deficits of cognitive abilities in schizophrenia. Neural correlates of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia were examined by linear regression analysis of the thalamocortical network activity with scores of seven cognitive domains. We confirmed the combination of reduced prefrontal-thalamic connectivity and increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity in patients with schizophrenia. Correlation analysis with cognition revealed that in schizophrenia (1) the thalamic functional connectivity in the bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri was negatively correlated with attention/vigilance and speed of processing (Pearson\u2019s r\u2009\u2264\u2009\u22120.443, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.042, FWE corrected), and positively correlated with patients\u2019 negative symptoms (Pearson\u2019s r\u2009\u2265\u20090.375, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.003, FWE corrected); (2) the thalamic functional connectivity in the right cerebellum was positively correlated with speed of processing (Pearson\u2019s r\u2009=\u20090.388, p\u2009=\u20090.01, FWE corrected).

The cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia are robust and extensive, with a 1.5 to 2.5 standard deviation gap between patients and controls in all ability domains, as measured by standard neurocognitive tasks. These impairments are present at the first-psychotic episode and clinically remitted states, and schizophrenia patients who were never exposed to neuroleptics also show highly significant neuropsychological deficits. The cognitive deficits are regarded as an important predictor of functional outcome for schizophrenia patients, and are also found among other first-degree relatives of schizophrenia probands. Although these studies provide important information regarding cognitive deficits as a potential precursor and vulnerability factor of schizophrenia, little is known about the neuropathological mechanisms underlying this core symptom across psychoses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2776, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The thalamus, a subcortical structure that transmits information from the peripheral sensory nervous system to the cortex, has been recently targeted in schizophrenia research. By examining interregional correlations in spontaneous, low-frequency, blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations, previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showed the importance of the abnormal thalamocortical functional interactions in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In particular, these studies have consistently found the combination of decreased thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and an increased connectivity with motor and somatosensory cortical areas in schizophrenia. Recently, the reduced prefrontal-thalamic connectivity and sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity confirmed in a majority of chronic patients was also observed in the early stage of psychosis and clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals, suggesting that thalamic dysconnectivity presents very early or even prior to the onset of illness.

Indeed, imaging studies have shown that decreased activation of the thalamus in schizophrenia patients during working memory tasks, and that the reduced prefrontal-thalamic connectivity in patients correlated with impaired working memory. On the contrary, Seidman et al. found that relatives of schizophrenia patients showed significantly greater task-elicited activation in the right dorsomedial thalamus, when carrying out an auditory continuous performance test. Another study also proved significant hyperactivation in the thalamus/basal ganglia of patients for both verbal and spatial working memory tasks. Animal models have also proven that a subtle decrease in mediodorsal (MD) thalamus activity is enough to cause impairment, particularly in cognitive tasks such as reversal learning and working memory. Additionally, Schmitt et al. found that MD thalamus stimulation amplifies prefrontal functional connectivity and promotes performance in forced-choice tests of attentional control.
