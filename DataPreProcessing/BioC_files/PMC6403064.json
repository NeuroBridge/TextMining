However, little is known about how common genetic risk factors for SCZ influence the structure and function of the human brain, largely due to the constraints of imaging sample sizes. In the current study, we use a novel recall-by-genotype (RbG) methodological approach, where we sample young adults from a population cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children: N genotyped = 8365) based on their SCZ-RPS. We compared 197 healthy individuals at extremes of low (N = 99) or high (N = 98) SCZ-RPS with behavioral tests, and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We first provide methodological details that will inform the design of future RbG studies for common SCZ genetic risk. We further provide an between group analysis of the RbG individuals (low vs high SCZ-RPS) who underwent structural neuroimaging data (T1\u2014weighted scans) and fMRI data during a reversal learning task. While we found little evidence for morphometric differences between the low and high SCZ-RPS groups, we observed an impact of SCZ-RPS on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during reward processing in the ventral striatum (PFWE-VS-CORRECTED = .037), a previously investigated broader reward-related network (PFWE-ROIS-CORRECTED = .008), and across the whole brain (PFWE-WHOLE-BRAIN-CORRECTED = .013).

These loci demonstrate biological convergence on central nervous system pathways such as voltage-gated calcium channel signaling, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) gene targets, and excitatory/inhibitory synaptic neurotransmission. SCZ polygenicity also confers susceptibility to other psychiatric disorders, suggesting a shared, common etiology. While the cumulative (polygenic) effects of currently identified risk alleles explain approximately 7% of SCZ liability, these risk profile scores (RPS) do not yet offer predictive utility. However, SCZ-RPS are useful in identifying causal antecedents that predict disease risk such as reduced cognitive ability, increased substance use and higher incidence for specific SCZ symptom dimensions. SCZ loci also show genetic overlap with a number of polygenic, heritable traits, including personality, education and socioeconomic status. SCZ-RPS has also been combined with neuroimaging measures to identify disturbances in brain structure and function that reflect mechanisms of SCZ disease pathogenesis. These SCZ-RPS neuroimaging studies broadly suggest that the subcortical structural abnormalities observed in SCZ have little/no overlap with SCZ genetic etiology. However, behavioral and neural measures of cognition (eg, using functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) may reflect disease susceptibility. These imaging SCZ-RPS studies support theories that cognitive dysfunction is a risk factor for SCZ, while at least some of the alterations in subcortical brain volumes may be downstream effects of disease processes (reverse causation). Such genetic neuroimaging studies provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of SCZ, but are limited by sample size and heterogeneity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3803, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We first describe the recall-by-genotype (RbG) approach for neuroimaging SCZ-RPS.

However, it is largely unknown whether these alterations are linked to the common genetic risk for SCZ. Studies further suggest potential alterations in morphometric and VS-BOLD measures in relatives/offspring of patients with SCZ, suggesting putative familial effects. However, these studies cannot infer that common SCZ risk alleles explain these putative observations. Preliminary studies using SCZ-RPS suggest that the morphometric alterations observed in SCZ are largely not related to an individual\u2019s burden of common SCZ risk alleles. In contrast, our preliminary work suggests common SCZ-RPS may explain some of the variance in the VS-BOLD response (as indexed by VS-BOLD). Together, these observations suggest that the SCZ-RPS is related to VS-BOLD but not morphometric measures such as subcortical volume.

After 7\u201311 trials, reward/punishment contingencies were reversed so that the previously rewarded color was now punished and vice versa. Participants were instructed to maximize their earnings during the learning session, which consisted of 12 reversal episodes in total (108 choice trials). Within each reversal episode we included either 1 or 2 PE (probabilistic error) trials, in which \u201cwrong\u201d-feedback was given for correct choices, even though the reward contingencies had not changed. At the start of each choice trial, participants were presented with a response cue consisting of 2 white frames surrounding the colors and prompting the participants to press the left or right button on a response box to choose one color. Response feedback (choice outcome) was given subsequently using a centrally presented white \u201csmiley\u201d (correct choice) or red \u201cfrowny\u201d (incorrect choice) face and an earnings counter changing incrementally by \u00b11p. In trials following reversal or PE events, ie, in those trials used for fMRI analysis, response cues and feedback stimuli were presented with a jittered duration (cue: 4\u20138 s, mean 5.5 s; feedback: 0.75 s followed by 3\u20137 s [mean 4.5 s] inter-trial-interval [ITI]: paradigm schematic in supplementary figure S2). To reduce scanning time, in all other (standard) trials we used fixed and shorter stimulus durations (cue: 2 s, feedback: 0.75 s). ITIs showed the 2 colors without response cue or feedback and were 0.5 s long after standard trials and between 4 and 8 s (mean 5.5 s) after PEs and reversals. BOLD response analysis focused on brain activation differences as a function choice behavior (switch > stay response) or choice outcomes (reward > punishment) in post-PE and postreversal trials. We selected those trials for analysis as they yielded a comparatively balanced number of rewards/and punishments (correct/vs incorrect choices) compared to standard trials (which were disproportionally more rewarded than punished. These regressors were modeled BOLD during decisional processes under high levels of uncertainty, ie, after participants had to choose a stay or switch strategy in response to an unexpected punishment in the previous (PE or reversal) trial and during rewarding or punishment based feedback. BOLD signal changes were regressed by task predictor functions (switch > stay and reward > punishment) convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. For the switch-stay contrast, predictor functions were synchronized with the onset of the response cue in post-PE/-reversal trials; having a duration of 4000 ms and including both predecisional and response processing. For the reward-punishment contrast and predictor time courses were locked to the onset of feedback stimuli in post-PE and postreversal trials, with a fixed duration of 3750 ms, which corresponded to the earliest possible start of the next choice trial. For each subject, statistical contrast images reward > punishment and switch > stay were obtained, which have previously shown good test\u2013retest reliability.

For between SCZ-RPS group comparisons, the family-wise error rate was controlled with nonparametric permutation testing (5000 permutations) and threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) which effectively controls for multiple comparisons, compared to cluster extent thresholding.

Our finding of a nominal association between SCZ-RPS and psychotic experience are similar to a recent observation (supplementary eTable 3 in Jones et al). It is currently unknown whether SCZ-RPS reflects a specific risk to develop psychotic symptoms or relates to broader psychopathological constructs such as common mental distress.

While we observed no relationship between SCZ-RPS and brain morphometry (in concordance with other SCZ polygenic imaging studies), several studies suggest that associations between SCZ-RPS and brain structure may be region specific or interact with other risk factors, which remain relatively unexplored.

SCZ-RPS was related to increased BOLD in the (1) VS, (2) extended reward-related search space, and (3) across a broader cortical network\u2014extending into posterior regions of the brain. While there are similarities between these observations (eg, increased VS-BOLD and SCZ-RPS during reward receipt), we observed several differences between the current findings and our previous findings. Specifically, we observed altered BOLD signal during the processes of choice outcome (ie, during reward receipt), compared to our previous observation linking SCZ-RPS to BOLD during choice decision (ie, uncertainty of outcome). However, we suggest that these observations largely conform to our broader hypothesis that BOLD signal in the reward processing network is associated with SCZ-RPS. We expand upon our previous findings by demonstrating that the altered BOLD signal associated with increased SCZ-RPS extends across a wider network including the hippocampal, cingulate cortex, precuenus, and thalamus. Imaging studies of individuals with increased genetic risk for SCZ have also implicated these cortical/subcortical regions, which may reflect the recruitment of alternative/additional neural resources proposed for other SCZ-associated fMRI-based endophenotypes. In line with previous hypotheses, these observations suggest that the common genetic architecture of SCZ may manifest via alterations in the activity of cognitive-motivational brain networks (eg, supporting reversal learning), in the presence of a relatively intact cortical/subcortical morphometry. This hypothesis is also supported by studies showing common genetic overlap between SCZ and cognition, but not brain volumes. Although we find evidence supporting SCZ-RPS related alterations in VS-BOLD in healthy individuals, it remains unknown how these alterations predispose risk to SCZ. Studies suggest that SCZ-related alterations in VS-BOLD could relate several symptom dimensions including (1) myopic decision making (similar to the VS-BOLD alterations observed in ADHD); (2) positive symptoms (such as delusions/aberrant salience) or (3) negative/depressive symptoms (such as anhedonia/avolition).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29168, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our future objectives are to explore the SCZ-RPS group differences across a range of neurophysiological and connectivity measures.
