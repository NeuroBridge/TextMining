This study aimed to investigate the neural correlates of AVHs in schizophrenia patients and its response to a modified continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) by transcranial magnetic stimulation. In a cross-sectional experiment, resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were collected from 31 AVH schizophrenia patients, 26 non-AVH schizophrenia patients, and 33 sex-/age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Functional connectivity strength (FCS) maps were compared among groups by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In a longitudinal experiment, 16 and 11 AVH patients received real and sham cTBS treatment for 15 days, respectively. Notably, this was not a randomized control trail. Changes in AVH and FCS were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and 2-sample t-test, respectively. In the cross-sectional experiment, comparison of FCS maps identified 8 clusters among groups, but only one cluster (in left cerebellum) differed significantly in AVH patients compared to both HCs and non-AVH patients. In the longitudinal experiment, the real cTBS group showed a greater improvement in symptoms and a larger FCS decrease in left cerebellum than the sham group. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis indicated that baseline FCS of the overlapping cerebellum cluster (between the cross-sectional and longitudinal findings) was negatively correlated with symptom improvement in the real treatment group.

Despite numerous studies using a variety of approaches, the exact mechanisms by which AVHs arise spontaneously from intrinsic brain activity remains unclear. To address this issue, recent studies have examined the spontaneous functional connectivity in schizophrenia patients with AVH using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Such studies have given rise to the \u201cresting state hypothesis of AVH,\u201d which posits that anomalies in intrinsic brain connectivity and ensuing activity generate AVHs. Indeed, compared to schizophrenia patients without AVH (non-AVH), AVH patients exhibited distinct intrinsic cortico-subcortical connectivity patterns and interhemispheric circuits. Particular attention has been paid to functional connectivity with the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), because the TPJ may be an effective repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) target for AVH patients. Local activity and global network properties have also been investigated by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and graph theory. To exclude potential confounding variables (ie, variations in medication history and severity of symptoms), the neural correlates of AVH have also been examined by comparing nonpsychotic individuals with and without AVH. Such rs-fMRI studies yielded useful information to enhance an understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AVH.

Hoffman and colleagues reported the possible efficacy of inhibitory rTMS on AVH in schizophrenia patients, and its frequency protocol (1-Hz rTMS over the left TPJ) was adopted in most subsequent studies. However, the clinical efficacy of this protocol was not consistently supported. In most of these studies, the TPJ was defined according to the international 10/20 system of electroencephalography electrode placement. Given the anatomical variability of the human brain, this coarse localization method may prove less accurate and efficient than image-based navigation approaches. Several studies have also tested continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) for AVH treatment, since this paradigm exhibited more powerful inhibitory aftereffects than 1-Hz rTMS in the motor system. However, a randomized trial found that the efficacy of cTBS was not significantly higher than placebo treatment.

Its involvement in AVH has been demonstrated by meta-analyses of functional activation experiments, though inconsistencies were also found. Dynamic fMRI analysis further indicated the activation of the left cerebellum prior to the occurrence of AVHs, suggesting a \u201ctrigger\u201d role of the cerebellum. At a cellular level, the crucial role of the cerebellum in schizophrenia has been systemically reviewed. Cerebellar Purkinje cells discriminate specific input conditions, such as variation in patterns of auditory input, through synaptoplastic processes including long-term potentiation and depression. In schizophrenia patients, the cerebellum fails to perform these error detection functions. As a result, input information from the auditory cortex without an external stimulus may be misinterpreted as \u201cexternal\u201d rather than internal, leading to the experience of AVHs. Decreased FCS within the cerebellum following treatment may reflect an attempt to rebalance inhibitory and excitatory transmission, which may result in an appropriate perception of inner speech. Both AVH and non-AVH patients showed similar alterations in the right cerebellum, right MPFC, and left ITG compared to HCs, which may underlie common symptoms of schizophrenia. On the other hand, non-AVH patients showed abnormalities in the bilateral cuneus, bilateral thalamus, left central sulcus, and left SMG compared to both AVH patients and HCs, which may be related to the unique symptoms of non-AVH patients. However, none of these clusters survived the fourth validation analysis.

This improved outcome may be due to optimized stimulation parameters, such as ISI, longer treatment and more sessions/day. Psychological factor may also contribute to this difference, since patients in our real group knew they would received real treatment, while patients in Koops et al did not know their group allocation. Our findings suggest that the left cerebellum constitutes an important neural correlate for this clinical improvement. The left cerebellum has directly structural connectivity with the right rather than left cortices, such as the stimulation target. Thus, future rTMS studies stimulating the right TPJ may produce stronger aftereffect in both neuroimaging and clinical efficacy.

Importantly, no cognitive difference was found between non-AVH and AVH groups. This finding suggests that extraneous factors were well-balanced between groups.

First, the rTMS experiment was not a randomized control trial. The sham group was recruited after the real group, and their instructions were slightly different. The real rTMS group was told that they would receive a novel treatment through magnetic stimulation, but its clinical efficacy was still in controversial. The sham group was part of a real RCT experiment, and the patients were instructed that they would be assigned to the real or sham group randomly. Thus, both real and sham group in this study would not have extremely high or no expectation on the treatment. Additionally, the sham stimulation was performed by a placebo coil, which induced quite similar sensory on scalp as the real one, but actually no induced current within the brain. Thus, the patients hardly knew whether they were receiving real or sham stimulation. For both group, the clinical syndrome was estimated by an experimenter blinded to the group allocation of patients. In all, the real and sham group had similar expectation before treatment and experienced similar stimulation procedures. To further exclude the effect of the design flaws on our findings, we strongly suggest a real RCT investigation. Second, the real and sham groups were not acquired by the same scanner, which was not an ideal design. For cross-sectional comparison, the results may be affected by the systematic error between scanners. But for comparison of longitudinal alteration, as our complementary experiment indicated, no significant scanner effect was found in the left cerebellum area. Third, this study did not control for the possible confounding effects of AVHs during rs-fMRI data acquisition.
