This voxel-based functional connectivity measure involves correlating the time-course for any voxel with the time-course of every other voxel in the gray matter. Traditionally, these correlations are summarized using a network theory metric, such as degree or strength. Such metrics can be calculated from the distribution of correlations for any voxelx. First, f(x, r) is defined as the distribution of the correlations (r) for the time-course at voxel x to the time-course at every other voxel in the brain and can be estimated by computing the histogram of these correlations. Degree, based on a binary graph, can be estimated as the integral of this distribution from any threshold \u03c4 to 1, ie, . Strength can be estimated as the mean of this distribution or a distribution of transformed correlations, , where is the correlation coefficients or the Fisher transform of the correlation coefficients. In contrast, ICD models the entire corresponding survival function, , of, where . Each point on the survival function is simply degree, based on a binary graph, evaluated at that particular threshold, \u03c4. The ICD approach parameterizes the change in a voxel\u2019s degree as the threshold defining whether voxels are connected (ie, correlation threshold) is increased. Previously, we showed that it was sufficient to model this survival function as a stretched exponential decay with unknown variance parameter and shape parameter: , where xis the spatial location of a voxel, r is a correlation between 2 time-courses, \u03b1 is the variance parameter, and \u03b2 is the shape parameter. Modeling the survival function, , with a stretched exponential is equivalent to modeling the underlying distribution of correlation, , as a Weibull distribution. Thus, ICD models the distribution of correlations between a voxel and every other voxel in the brain, with \u03b1 as the parameter of interest.

Our results indicate an increase in connectivity between language processing regions, the putamen, and the DMN with an accompanying decrease in connectivity between DMN nodes. These results are broadly consistent with the majority of functional connectivity studies and a recent meta-analysis of AVH and suggest an AVH network. This network is similar to the \u201cresting-state hypothesis\u201d network, where increased DMN activity influences auditory and language connectivity and leads to AVHs. However, our results suggest an overall reduced integrity or connectivity between nodes in the DMN consistent with other work. Reduced connectivity within the DMN is not necessarily in conflict with previously reported increased activity in certain DMN nodes. Unconstrained increases in activity may be less synchronized across regions leading to a reduction of connectivity within the DMN. In addition, the complexity of the derived network (figure 4) may provide an explanation for the relative treatment-resistance of this symptom. The numerous cortical and subcortical components may prevent network-wide functional shifts when only a few components are perturbed by standard treatments.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26245, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "With the exception of the PCC, significant correlations between the AHRS and voxel-wise connectivity were observed in regions distinct from those detected in group comparisons. Nevertheless, these regions were located in the 2 main networks (language processing and DMN) consistent with the findings from group comparisons, underscoring the role of these nodes in forming a putative hallucination network. Decreased whole-brain connectivity in both the PCC and right TPJ was associated with increased AHRS (worse AVH symptoms), consistent with the weakening of the DMN presented here and elsewhere. Similarly, decreased lateralization in left BA47 was associated with increased AHRS, which could be associated with either a decrease in connectivity to left hemisphere regions or an increase in connectivity to right hemisphere regions. Finally, increased global connectivity in right auditory cortex was associated with increased AHRS, consistent with models of AVHs. Considering the observed distinction between regions associated with group differences and regions associated with symptoms reported here, the clinical relevance of these findings remains to be determined.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27419, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Methodological Considerations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27449, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We used 2, data-driven, voxel-wise methods to investigate AVHs in patients with schizophrenia.

However, we did not have a non-schizophrenia AVH group to determine if these connectivity differences are general to AVHs or specific to AVHs in schizophrenia. It is noteworthy that effects of antipsychotic medication were not found in our potential AVHs network using correlational methods (figure S2); however, medication effects may not scale linearly. Scan data for a portion of the subjects were not fully resting state, and, in some cases, included an occasional button press for the subject to indicate when they were experiencing a hallucination (for AVHs+) and random button presses (for AVHs\u2212 and HCs). The frequency of button presses across groups was not significantly different and further analyses suggested that this did not drive our results (figures S5 and S6). Data from this study were from a previously published study, which used a priori seeds in language regions (Brocca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas). This study reported a corticostriatal loop consisting of the left IFG, bilateral Wernicke\u2019s areas, and bilateral putamen circuit underlying AVHs, similar to the chICD differences between AVHs+ and AVHs\u2212. By using data-driven methods, we have extended this 5-node model to a 25-node model including several novel nodes in the DMN. While we performed several steps to minimize motion confounds, differences in motion between the patients and HCs approached significance. While resting-state fMRI is a powerful tool to map the functional organization of the brain, inherent limitations exist. If resting state is conceptualized as a task state, different groups may have differences in \u201cperforming\u201d rest. For example, experiencing AVHs during rest may create a state difference between AVHs+ and AVHs\u2212/HCs that is not accounted for in traditional resting-state analyses. As we did not sample participants\u2019 experience with post-scan interviews, we cannot control for such possible state differences. Lastly, it is unlikely that the identified regions represent the only nodes in an AVH network.
