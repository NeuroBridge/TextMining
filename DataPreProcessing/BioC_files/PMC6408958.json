To test the regulatory function of these conserved risk sequence-bound conformations, we performed single-guide RNA (sgRNA)\u2013based epigenomic editing experiments on isogenic antibiotic-selected NPCs that stably express nuclease-deficient dCas9-VP64 or dCas9-VPR transactivators (table S13). Previous studies in peripheral cell lines succeeded in inducing gene expression changes by placing dCas9-repressor fusion proteins at the site of chromosomal contacts separated by up to 2 Mb of linear genome from the promoter target.

Because portions of the MATR3-bound risk sequences are embedded in repressive chromatin, we directed five sgRNAs for Cas9 nuclease mutagenesis toward a 138\u2013base pair (bp) sequence within a MATR3 long-range contact that was enriched with trimethyl-histone H3K27me3, commonly associated with Polycomb repressive chromatin remodeling, in order to disrupt it (fig.

This strategy produced a significant increase in MATR3 expression upon ablation of the putative repressor sequence, whereas targeting MATR3 (linear genome) control sequence remained ineffective (fig.

These findings broadly resonate with a recent report linking neural differentiation to multiple scales of 3DG folding, governed by multiple mechanisms, including CTCF-dependent loop alterations, repressive chromatin remodeling, and cell- and lineage-specific transcription factor networks. Our results suggest that developmental 3DG remodeling affects a substantial portion of sequences that confer liability for schizophrenia; furthermore, these genes in 3D physical proximity with schizophrenia-risk variants show a surprisingly strong correlation at the level of the transcriptome and proteome. How might the disease-relevant reorganization of the spatial genome (the \u201cchromosomal connectome\u201d) provide a structural foundation for coordinated regulation of expression? Recent Hi-C studies in mouse brain showed that chromosomal contacts preferentially occurred between loci targeted by the same transcription factors, and likewise, multiple schizophrenia risk loci could converge on intra- and interchromosomal hubs sharing a similar regulatory architecture including specific enhancers as well as transcription and splicing factors. Intriguingly, the three major functional categories associated with the genetic risk architecture of schizophrenia\u2014neuronal connectivity, synaptic signaling, and chromatin remodeling \u2014were heavily represented within the cell type\u2013specific chromosomal connectomes of neurons and NPCs described here (Fig. 3, B and E) and in whole tissue in vivo. Cell type\u2013specific 3DG reorganization during the course of neural progenitor differentiation, as shown here, could therefore have profound implications for our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of psychiatric disease. For example, inclusion of the cell type\u2013specific risk (sequence)\u2013associated chromosomal connectome may lead to refinements of cumulative schizophrenia risk allele burden estimates, including \u201cpolygenic risk score\u201d (PRS) or \u201cbiologically informed multilocus profile scores\u201d (BIMPS), which currently only explain a small portion of disease risk. Cell type\u2013specific intersection of 3DG and genetic risk maps are of clinical interest beyond psychiatric disorders; for example, risk variants that confer susceptibility to auto-immune disease were embedded in physically interacting chromosomal loci in lymphoblastoid cells. Our 3DG maps from neural progenitors and their isogenic neurons and glia are accessible through the PsychENCODE Knowledge Portal (https://synapse.org) and more than double the number of currently available Hi-C datasets from human brain, providing investigators with a resource to chart the expanded genome space associated with cognitive and neuropsychiatric disease in context of cell type\u2013specific remodeling of chromosomal conformations during early development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37777, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Materials and methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37799, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "In situ Hi-C from hiPSC-derived cells", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37837, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In situ Hi-C libraries were generated from 2 million to 5 million cultured hiPSC-derived NPCs, glia, and neurons as described in without modifications in the protocol.
