Impairments of interhemispheric cooperation have been reported in schizophrenia patients, but whether such abnormalities should be attributed to effects of illness or familial risk remains inconclusive. Moreover, it is unclear how abnormalities in interhemispheric connectivity impact hemispheric specialization. To address these questions, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large cohort of 253 participants, including 84 schizophrenia patients, 106 of their unaffected siblings and 63 healthy controls. Interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization were calculated from resting-state functional connectivity, and compared across groups. Results showed that schizophrenia patients exhibit lower interhemispheric connectivity as compared to controls and siblings. In addition, patients showed higher levels of hemispheric specialization as compared to siblings. Level of interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization correlated with duration of illness in patients. No significant alterations were identified in siblings relative to controls on both measurements. Furthermore, alterations in interhemispheric connectivity correlated with changes in hemispheric specialization in patients relative to controls and siblings.

Unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients are a valuable population to study this question as they share the genetic predisposition and environmental factors for the illness, but are not clinically affected. Previous studies have reported abnormalities in unaffected relatives in large-scale brain regional interactions during tasks and rest, and a limited number of studies have shown subtle abnormalities in functional, and structural connectivity between homotopic brain regions in patients and relatives.

Traditionally, hemispheric specialization studies have focused on functional or anatomical asymmetry of homotopic brain regions. More recently, studies have extended the concept of hemispheric specialization to include connectivity asymmetry, by investigating functional interaction patterns of brain regions in the two hemispheres. One such measurement is the hemispheric autonomy index, which calculates the difference in connectivity strength of a brain region with ipsilateral areas versus contralateral areas during rest. Studies have shown that regions with high autonomy values (i.e. preferably connecting to ipsilateral areas) in the left hemisphere overlap with regions showing asymmetrical activation during language tasks, and that regional autonomy index values correlate with verbal and visuospatial behavioral scores in healthy subjects. We hypothesize that impaired interhemispheric connectivity may cause the two hemispheres to function more autonomously, favoring within over between-hemisphere interregional cooperation.

This connectivity profile may indicate a more important role of the left primary auditory cortex in integration and processing of auditory information. Connectivity of the caudate nucleus tends to be more ipsilateral in the right hemisphere as compared to the left hemisphere, which is different from the results of a previous study, but is consistent with a right-over-left dopamine receptor availability in this region in healthy subjects.
