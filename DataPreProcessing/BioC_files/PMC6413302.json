Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies typically reported disrupted striatal connectivity in patients with psychosis and in individuals at clinical and genetic high risk of the disorder relative to healthy controls. This has not been widely studied in healthy individuals with subclinical psychotic-like experiences (schizotypy). Here we applied the emerging technology of multi-echo rs-fMRI to examine corticostriatal connectivity in this group, which is thought to drastically maximize physiological noise removal and increase BOLD contrast-to-noise ratio. Multi-echo rs-fMRI data (echo times, 12, 28, 44, 60\u202fms) were acquired from healthy individuals with low (LS, n\u202f=\u202f20) and high (HS, n\u202f=\u202f19) positive schizotypy as determined with the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE). After preprocessing to ensure optimal contrast and removal of non-BOLD signal components, whole-brain functional connectivity from six striatal seeds was compared between the HS and LS groups. Effects were considered significant at cluster-level p\u202f<\u202f.05 family-wise error correction. Compared to LS, HS subjects showed lower rs-fMRI connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal regions and ventral striatal regions. Lower connectivity was also observed between the dorsal putamen and the hippocampus, occipital regions, as well as the cerebellum. These results demonstrate that subclinical positive psychotic-like experiences in healthy individuals are associated with striatal hypoconnectivity as detected using multi-echo rs-fMRI. Further application of this approach may aid in characterizing functional connectivity abnormalities across the extended psychosis phenotype.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1920, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Highlights", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1931, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Multi-echo fMRI was used to investigate resting-state connectivity in subjects with low and high psychometric schizotypy (HS).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2058, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "High schizotypy subjects showed hypoconnectivity between ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2168, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "These subjects also showed hypoconnectivity between dorsal striatum and temporooccipital regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2266, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2279, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Over the last two decades, the dysconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia has gained growing neurobiological support due to technical advances in structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging. The dysconnection hypothesis suggests that the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia arise from abnormal functional integration between distributed brain regions due to altered neuromodulation of synaptic plasticity, particularly in regions with dopaminergic afferents. A key area is the striatum, which receives prominent innervations from dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, and is central to the orchestration of activity of limbic, associative and motor brain regions through interconnected cortico-striatal loops, thereby supporting a range of neural computations necessary for normal cognitive function. Striatal dysregulation may therefore be involved in widespread disruption of these circuits and the emergence of positive symptoms. Indeed, a number of studies in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) of psychosis reported increased presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity and release in the striatum (see for a meta-analysis), and a direct correlation between the extent of striatal dysfunction and the severity of positive psychotic symptoms in patients. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that positive symptoms may be associated with disrupted task-related striatal activation and connectivity during the attribution of aberrant salience to otherwise irrelevant stimuli in healthy individuals, CHR subjects, and patients with a full-blown psychotic disorder. Such evidence aligns well with predictions based on animal models of psychosis which show that striatal dysfunction may result from increased hippocampal activity, which may in turn be related to prefrontal cortex (PFC) abnormalities, and propose that disrupted interactions within this corticostriatal circuit contribute to the development of aberrant salience processing and positive symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4284, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this context, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful tool to examine patterns of altered functional connectivity and their relationship to symptomatology in patients with established psychosis as well as in individuals at genetic or CHR of psychosis (e.g.). rs-fMRI studies focusing on striatal connectivity in patients with schizophrenia and in their relatives have reported altered functional integration of this region with a number of cortical areas, including mainly the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Dimensional views of psychosis postulate that there is continuity between subclinical psychotic-like experiences which can be detected in healthy people using validated self-report questionnaires (that is, schizotypy) and psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Consistent with this psychosis continuum view, a recent rs-fMRI study reported that scores on the positive dimension of schizotypy (relating to cognitive-perceptual experiences) were positively associated with ventral striatal\u2013PFC connectivity, and negatively associated with dorsal striatal\u2013posterior cingulate connectivity. Similarly, another recent study by R\u00f6ssler and colleagues reported ventral striatal dysconnectivity in a schizotypy sample and provided preliminary evidence that this might indeed result from dopaminergic alterations, supporting the dysconnection hypothesis. In particular, the authors found lower ventral striatal connectivity in participants who scored higher on a schizotypy scale regardless of whether they had received an L-Dopa or placebo challenge, whereas participants with lower schizotypy scores showed striatal dysconnectivity following L-Dopa administration. However, the samples used in both studies above were largely composed of individuals with scores in the low to moderate range. It thus remains unclear whether corticostriatal dysconnectivity extends to individuals with high positive schizotypy scores. This is an important question as previous studies in schizophrenia and CHR subjects indicate that the greater the rs-fMRI dysconnectivity, the higher the severity of positive symptoms, and that high scores in positive schizotypy scales are associated with higher severity of positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6587, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The high schizotypy paradigm is a widely used strategy to examine neurobiological factors related to the expression of psychotic symptoms in the absence of possibly confounding disease-related effects such as antipsychotic medication exposure and illness chronicity which can affect rs-fMRI data (, 2015). However, additional confounders in imaging studies may arise from technical limitations, as for example, rs-fMRI data tends to be noisy and may result in indeterminacy of the sources of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals, particularly within subcortical regions. Previous studies in psychosis and schizotypy used standard rs-fMRI, which is based on single-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences employing echo times (TEs) designed to roughly correspond to the average tissue T2*, in order to optimize contrast. However, because T2* varies regionally, so does the signal-to-contrast ratio, resulting in signal loss in parts of the brain where T2* is particularly short or long (e.g.). This compromises the quality of the data, especially in low T2* regions such as the inferior temporal cortices, or indeed the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Adding to this issue, rs-fMRI connectivity findings are highly vulnerable to spurious effects: because they are often based on correlational analyses, any factor that simultaneously influences signal in more than one region of the brain will increase observed connectivity, while factors that influence signal in a single region will decrease observed connectivity, such as head motion, cardiac and respiratory rates, arterial CO\u2082 concentration and blood pressure (see e.g. for a detailed discussion). Typically, this type of so called physiological noise is dealt with using band-pass-filtering for the BOLD signal frequency band (0.01\u202fHz\u20130.08\u202fHz) and removal of the variance explained by separately acquired physiological nuisance recordings using linear regression. However, significant noise remains even after data clean-up, and nuisance variation that has not been modelled will inevitably remain. These limitations can be addressed by using an fMRI sequence that collects multiple echoes after each pulse. Firstly, the collection of multiple echoes allows for the relaxometric estimation of region specific T2* values, and hence for the voxel-wise computation of a contrast optimized signal from appropriately weighted echoes, which drastically improves overall contrast-to-noise ratio. Secondly, the collection of multiple echoes allows for blind separation of BOLD-like from non-BOLD-like signal components: while the observed percent signal change \u0394S always depends on both changes in the initial signal intensity (S0) and changes in T2*, BOLD effects modulate T2* much more than S0, and non-BOLD effects (e.g. head motion, cerebrovascular pulsatility, hardware related fluctuation etc.) modulate S0 much more than T2*. Since T2* scales linearly with TE but S0 does not, regression of signal components identified using independent component analysis against TE and S0 can be used to differentiate between BOLD- and non-BOLD-like components. Thus, nuisance contributions can be reliably removed even if their source is unknown.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9800, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To date, these technical limitations have not been addressed in investigations of rs-fMRI connectivity in the psychosis spectrum.

Further, we found no evidence of an association between dorsal system alterations and symptom scores in our data.
