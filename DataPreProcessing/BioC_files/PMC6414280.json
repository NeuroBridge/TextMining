PSs are summary measures that weight single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from across the genome to provide a measured index of the genetic propensity for a given disorder. Salvatore and colleagues recently developed an externalizing polygenic score in adults with alcohol dependence and showed that it explained 6% of the variance in externalizing disorders (alcohol/substance use disorders, antisocial behavior) and 2\u20137% of the variance in other disinhibited phenotypes (e.g., impulsiveness). Building on these findings, we recently replicated the association between the polygenic score and externalizing symptoms in trauma-exposed veterans and found that the polygenic score predicted impaired performance on inhibitory control tasks. Thus, initial validation studies find reliable polygenic associations with externalizing phenotypes and illustrate the promise of this approach for identifying heritable neural mechanisms associated with genetic predispositions for externalizing. An important next step in this line of research is to examine the neurobiological correlates of the externalizing PS. Research that aims to characterize the influences of genetic variations on brain structures and function has grown exponentially over the past several years, and yielded greater insight into the heritability of neurobiological risk factors for psychopathology, including emerging neurogenetics research on externalizing disorders (e.g.,).

Indeed, there is growing data to support the heritability of resting-state neural activity, including aberrant connectivity in these networks in psychiatric populations. Recently developed graph theory tools can be applied to resting-state connectivity data to investigate brain organization and function in psychiatric populations, potentially identifying brain networks that exhibit differential features across psychiatric disorders. Graph theory is an analytic tool involving the calculation of network properties that can be used to examine the organization of network connections and, thus, the functional capabilities of a network and the role that nodes (brain regions) play in global and local circuitry. For example, the graph theory property Participation Coefficient measures the extent to which a brain region serves as a \u201chub\u201d that connects different modules (sub-networks). By assessing distributed functional networks, these methods capture greater complexity in the neural bases of psychiatric disorders than is possible when limiting analysis to single regions or even coupling between pairs of regions, approaches that have traditionally dominated research on the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders.

This finding suggests that rostral cingulate may help regulate emotional reactivity in part by decreasing engagement of the amygdala in response to emotional distractors in healthy individuals. Our findings suggest that this pattern may be reversed in individuals with higher polygenic associations with externalizing disorders, such that amygdala has greater influence on prefrontal cognitive control structures, at least during resting state.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27109, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Polygenic burden was also associated with greater bilateral amygdala and left rostral ACC Participation Coefficient, suggesting that these regions are more likely to serve as \u2018connector hubs\u2019 as genetic risk increases. Connector hubs provide \u2018shortcuts\u2019 to communicate between segregated modules, and such module segregation is necessary for a network to perform multiple types of specialized processes. Thus, our findings suggest that amygdala and rACC influence a wider range of specialized processes as externalizing polygenic scores increase. This may lead to greater influence of amygdala on, not only bilateral IFG as the resting-state connectivity analyses suggested, but on a diverse range of processes. These findings extend previous work on externalizing by suggesting that abnormalities in neural network organization may be a heritable mechanism by which genetic risk for externalizing is conferred.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28021, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study identified genetically-associated circuitry via resting-state coupling in order to examine genomic relations with stable functional networks. Thus, an important next step in this line of research will be to investigate the functional and structural features of externalizing PS-related brain networks. First, examining how connectivity in this network shifts in response to cognitive/emotional challenges, like inhibitory control tasks, will be important to address in future research. Connectivity between PFC executive-control regions (rACC, IFG) and subcortical regions crucial for emotion/salience (amygdala) increases with the demand for inhibitory control. Based on limited research on functional connectivity and impulsivity we would not expect high externalizing individuals to show this increase in PFC-subcortical connectivity with increasing inhibitory control demands in functional tasks. An alternative hypothesis, based on the present findings, is that bottom-up (e.g., affective) processes would influence inhibitory control to a greater extent in high externalizing individuals, rather than top-down control simply being deficient. Second, it will be important to isolate the anatomical pathways that enable the identified functional network, given that resting-state fMRI coupling does not imply direct anatomic connection and these analyses are not bounded by such connections.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29428, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given that brain circuits, behavioral phenotypes, and environmental mechanisms are likely reciprocally influential, studying how these dynamic relationships evolve across development will be important for establishing developmental pathways to behavioral manifestations of externalizing. The cross-sectional nature of our data prohibits strong conclusions regarding the direction of the proposed effects, and prospective research is needed to ascertain the mechanism(s) by which neural and behavioral phenotypes interact overtime. The observed associations across genetic, neural, and behavioral levels of analysis provides compelling evidence that resting-state connectivity in the identified network is a heritable mechanism that confers risk for externalizing. At the same time, more research is needed to validate this network as an endophenotype, including examining the generalizability of the polygenic associations with network connectivity. Additionally, although this study focused on identifying neurobiological mechanisms related to genetic risk for externalizing, understanding the role environmental factors play in the etiology of externalizing disorders is equally important. There is extensive evidence to suggest that environmental influences exert both direct and interactive effects on externalizing outcomes. For example, a large literature points to exposure to risky contexts (e.g., deviant peers) and stressful events (e.g., trauma) as powerful environments that interact with genes to confer risk for externalizing outcomes (e.g.,), including in studies of polygenic risk for externalizing. Based on these findings, incorporating the environment as a level of analysis in future polygenic-neuroimaging studies will be important for developing comprehensive etiological models of externalizing disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31257, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study has several strengths including analysis of multiple levels of analysis (genes, brain circuits, and behavior), a relatively large neuroimaging-genetics sample, and use of thousands of loci to identify genetically-associated brain circuits. Several limitations should also be considered. First, we were unable to model the latent externalizing spectrum because a measure of antisocial behavior and/or trait constraint was not available, a limitation that may have impacted associations between the externalizing PS and externalizing psychopathology (i.e., alcohol and substance use disorders) in this sample. Given that the externalizing PS was developed to capture genetic risk for comorbidity among externalizing disorders, assessing the covariance among alcohol/substance use disorders and antisocial behavior may be necessary to detect a robust polygenic association with these phenotypes. Second, although our ability to detect small effects was limited by the modest sample size, the sample was comparable to other recent neuroimaging-genetic studies (Little et al., 2015; Pagliaccio et al., 2015). Further, we cannot say definitively that the current results will generalize to the latent externalizing spectrum. Third, we did not have an independent sample to examine the replicability of our findings. Investigating the replicability of our findings in a larger independent sample with more diverse sample characteristics (e.g., greater representation of women, ethnic minorities, and civilians) is needed before strong conclusions can be drawn. Fourth, the cross-sectional nature of our data prohibits conclusions regarding the direction of the proposed effects, and prospective research is needed to ascertain the mechanism(s) by which neural and behavioral phenotypes interact overtime. For example, it is possible that the externalizing PS causes an externalizing phenotype (clinical symptoms) that then leads to variability in the neural phenotypes rather than the genes relating directly to neural network functioning. Only longitudinal studies that assess the interactive effects of multiple levels of analysis over time are well positioned to clarify the direction of these effects. Finally, although use of an independently-derived PS represents a less biased approach to genetic analysis than selecting candidate genes, there are limitations to the polygenic approach. For example, the predictive power of the PS is limited by the robustness of the original GWAS, and the PS assumes an additive genetic model without interactions, which might not optimally reflect the underlying genetic architecture of externalizing. Additionally, the PS does not take into account environmental effects. Given the high level of stress exposure in the current sample and externalizing prone samples in general (e.g.,), examining the influence of potential epigenetic effects in relation to externalizing disorders will be important to explore in future research, such as whether differentially methylated loci associated with externalizing overlap with the externalizing PS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34346, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, findings suggest that disturbed resting-state connectivity in a circuit implicated in emotion regulation, impulse control, and reinforcement learning is a putative biological pathway linking polygenic risk for externalizing with psychiatric outcomes.
