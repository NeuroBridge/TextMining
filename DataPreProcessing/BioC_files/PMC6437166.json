Here, NIRS was used at rest to measure spontaneous activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a main locus of default mode network. Consistent with previous fMRI studies, magnitude of the spontaneous activity in this region declined with increasing age in healthy subjects. The magnitude reduced in the mPFC of patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, in the mPFC of patients with schizophrenia, the spontaneous activity did not show any age-related decline; the activity was already low in younger patients. Further analysis using fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations confirmed the reduction of spontaneous activity in the mPFC of patients with schizophrenia, consistent with the findings of fMRI studies. Our findings demonstrate the ability of NIRS to evaluate the spontaneous activity in the mPFC of patients with schizophrenia, particularly younger patients.

This methodology characterises specific functional networks of the brain by capturing simultaneous low-frequency (<0.1\u2009Hz) fluctuations of cerebral blood flow. The network, originally identified as a cluster of brain regions with specifically activated cerebral blood flow when at rest, is called the default mode network (DMN). This network chiefly comprises the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, inferior parietal lobule and lateral temporal cortex.

Several studies have used this analysis method to demonstrate that the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is reduced in midline structures of the DMN, such as the mPFC and PCC/precuneus, in patients with schizophrenia.

To further develop DMN research for its practical application to psychiatric disorders, a more convenient modality to evaluate DMN activity is warranted. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is easy to use and a relatively low-cost imaging modality that is considered safer than PET. NIRS is also suitable for resting-state measurements because it is less physically burdensome (relatively insensitive to movement artifacts) and allows for measuring blood flow changes without the inevitable noise produced during fMRI measurements. Previous studies on the simultaneous recordings of NIRS and fMRI have reported that NIRS has a high concurrent validity with fMRI in resting and cognitive paradigms. Instead, the detectable blood flow in NIRS is restricted to the cortical surface area because this device can measure up to the points located at a depth of approximately 2\u2009cm below the scalp. Nonetheless, a study previously reported that a NIRS channel superficially covering the mPFC could successfully capture low-frequency fluctuations synchronised with those in the DMN delineated by fMRI. Combined with the evidence that the mPFC is the major region of the brain having reduced DMN activity in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, it is crucial to determine if the activity changes associated with the DMN are captured in the mPFC of schizophrenia using NIRS.

Our results showed that the magnitude of spontaneous activity reduced in the mPFC of patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the spontaneous activity in this region of the patients did not show any age-related decline; their spontaneous activity was low since a young age. Taken together, our results suggest that the reduction of spontaneous activity in the mPFC is more clearly observed in younger patients with schizophrenia, because younger healthy subjects have a larger spontaneous activity.

This inconsistency can be attributed to two factors. One is a technical difference in analysing \u0394oxy-Hbpeak and fALFF. Some consistently activated signals during the resting-state, which was counted in \u0394oxy-Hbpeak analysis, may be removed by excluding very low-frequency fluctuations (<0.01\u2009Hz) in the fALFF analysis. The other reason is a high variability of spontaneous activity in younger healthy subjects as seen in Fig.\u00a01a. The time course of oxy- and deoxy-Hb signals in Fig.\u00a03b demonstrates a potent activation during the resting state, a phenomenon frequently observed in the younger healthy subjects (Fig.\u00a01a). This activation seems to resemble a hemodynamic response, and not just only fluctuations, during the resting state. These observations implied that these activated signals are due to spontaneous thoughts, known as mind wandering, which is likely to occur during the resting state more often in younger individuals.

The resting-state paradigm has the advantage of assessing patients having some difficulties in adhering to attention-demanding tasks, which is often the case in schizophrenia. Given the safe and convenient clinical applications of NIRS and its suitability for resting-state measurements owing to its comfortability, our results indicate that NIRS measurements at rest may be applied to psychiatry practice concerning schizophrenia.

First, NIRS does not technically quantify precise cortical activity. While NIRS channels lack precise annotation to detect a segmentalised cortical area, NIRS signals include contamination of peripheral hemodynamic factors, such as skin perfusion, a major problem in NIRS acquisition. Therefore, we cannot completely specify the cortical signals in the NIRS system. However, a previous study that analysed the resting state showed that the radial areas within 3\u2009cm of the NIRS channel on mPFC showed high (>90%) association with cortical signals in fMRI. Second, we cannot exclude the possible influence of antipsychotic medication on spontaneous activity, because all the patients examined in this study were administered antipsychotics. Although no association was observed between the antipsychotic dose and spontaneous activity in the mPFC, the sample size of our cohort is too small to manage the possibility of a statistical type 2 error and to determine the variation caused by antipsychotics. Supplementarily, to examine the influence of antipsychotics on the spontaneous activity of mPFC, we recruited patients with mood or personality disorders who were medicated with antipsychotics (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). The activity of these patients was not lower than that of healthy subjects, which implies that the reduced spontaneous activity in the patients with schizophrenia was not due to antipsychotic medication. Third, the lack of sufficient sample size may also explain the failure to detect a significant association of the spontaneous activity with the clinical symptoms of the patients with schizophrenia.
