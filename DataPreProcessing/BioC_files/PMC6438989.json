Part of the struggle to reduce alcohol misuse and its negative impacts is a lack of understanding of AUD across the spectrum of severity, which may require different approaches to treatment. Most studies examine the neurobiology of AUD through dichotomous analysis of patients versus controls. It is especially necessary to understand AUD as a dimensional condition given its complex underpinnings. A prominent theory of AUD includes three interconnected neurocircuits that underlie the cycle of addiction: binge/intoxication (reward and reinforcement processes in the basal ganglia networks); withdrawal/negative affect (engaging salience network regions in the extended amygdala and portions of the nucleus accumbens); and preoccupation/ anticipation \u201ccraving\u201d (salience network with connections to default mode and executive control networks in conditioned incentive salience processes). One explanation of the mechanism underlying this cycle is that chronic alcohol use is associated with a reduction in mesolimbic dopaminergic neurocircuitry followed by compensatory recruitment of systems associated with stress response. However, these reviews and others (e.g.,) suggest that alcohol use impacts a wide variety of brain networks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3926, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There is substantial research on neural differences during task-based fMRI associated with AUD.

Individuals with AUD may also have differential neural activity associated with impulse control, response to emotional cues, response inhibition, and risk-taking. More severe AUD is related to engagement of SN/basal ganglia network structures during alcohol taste cued craving, impulsive choice (E. D.), and selection of alcoholic versus non-alcoholic beverages.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4784, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The effects of short- and long-term alcohol use on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) dynamics have been previously examined. AUD individuals have increased between network but weaker within network connectivity than controls, particularly within ECN, DMN, basal ganglia, SN, and visual networks. An study of dynamic network connectivity during rest suggests reduced occupancy of states characterized by salience-motor-sensory network connectivity. As individuals with AUD are abstinent, rs-fMRI synchrony progressively decreases within reward networks but increases in executive control networks. Acute alcohol intoxication moderates functional connectivity during rs-fMRI, and is associated with increased visual network and frontal theta engagement. Atypical neural dynamics during rs-fMRI may be a pre-existing risk factor for AUD. Importantly for treatment, some findings suggest that rs-fMRI antisynchrony can also be used as a success marker for treatment and synchrony as a risk factor for relapse.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5818, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are also demonstrated associations between AUD and gray matter volume (GMV).

Multimodal imaging may also be useful in predicting outcomes like substance use treatment completion and rearrest. Overall, these approaches may contribute distinct utility for use in patient groups. However, in the AUD field, few studies quantitatively compare or combine rs-fMRI, task-fMRI, and structural MRI (sMRI), particularly in terms of clinical utility. Vergara and colleagues demonstrate some shared variation and unique contributions between genetic, sMRI, and rs-fMRI data in binge-drinking individuals; however, this study does not investigate the relationship between this correspondence and AUD severity.

Then, 3dDespike was applied to smooth spikes in signal over the time course. Next, time courses were shifted for each voxel to be aligned to the same temporal origin by detrending then interpolating the time series.

Finally, each volume was blurred with a 4-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian smoothing kernel. For the task-fMRI data, TRs where the motion derivative value was 0.3\u202fmm/TR or higher were censored from future analysis and stimuli onset times were regressed to identify signal associated with each condition, with demeaned motion parameters and their derivatives regressed to remove variance associated with movement.

For example, DMN engagement during rest differentiates Alzheimer's disease from normal aging. Resting state neural dynamic differences have also been associated with depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Some work challenges the role of rs-fMRI as useful above and beyond specific task-fMRI; our finding that rs-fMRI features perform better than task-fMRI, sMRI or even basic demographic information in predicting AUD severity runs counter to that. Given this, standard clinical MRI scan protocols may be improved by the addition of a rs-fMRI scan, which takes 5\u201310\u202fmin to collect and doesn't require complex tasks, training, or stimulus presentation software.

All participants in our sample are moderate to heavy alcohol users while most studies in this field examine AUD dichotomously. Moreover, the mechanisms associated with chronic versus acute alcohol administrations differ; a biomarker important for diagnosis may not also vary with severity. The effects of severity within an AUD sample may also be smaller than group differences. In emotional face processing and sMRI studies here, replication was only seen at lower thresholds, possibly indicating that our sample was underpowered to detect effects of severity on these neural measures. Further, previous studies did not consistently control for demographic variables like age, IQ, and gender, which are related to brain structure. These variables may also interact with AUD; older individuals have increased neural vulnerability to alcohol misuse, IQ is impacted by and predicts chronic alcohol use, and educated individuals are less likely to drink heavily.

First, this study has a small sample for training and further testing a prediction model. This is likely reflected in the large variability in the R2 values across training folds. Random forest models are able to handle a low ratio of observations to parameters as is present in this data set, although such a sample size here may still leave the model vulnerable to overfitting, given the large number of features included. In order to address this, we ran a supplementary model in which we changed model selection criteria during training to follow Breiman's 1SE rule, favoring shallower trees and thus, less likely to overfit. This did not reduce indicators of potential overfitting (i.e., R2 values for the primary sample increased or did not substantively change; R2 values in the validation sample dropped or did not substantively change). Moreover, the risk of overfitting a model is that the model fits random noise and variation specific to the training sample rather than to the population the model is designed to estimate. However, by using cross-validation within development of the model in the primary sample, and further testing the model with a separate validation sample, we address this concern by reporting the models' abilities to generalize to another subsample of the population. We do emphasize the need to focus on the results from the validation sample and interpret cautiously findings from the primary sample (i.e., the feature importance rankings), as the latter are not tested for generalizability.

Although demographic/behavioral variables (i.e., age, IQ, gender, years of education, smoking) were not significantly related to AUDIT in our sample, AUD individuals tend to differ from non-substance using individuals on many of these traits. It is also possible that some of the variance the model does account for is related to traits such as smoking or comorbid substance use, particularly considering previous work demonstrates shared and independent connectivity correlates in smokers who do or do not also use alcohol. However, we do not believe this is what is driving our results since these factors were not significantly related to AUDIT total score. Moreover, comorbid tobacco and illicit drug use is characteristic of the population we hope to generalize to; >50% of heavy drinkers also use tobacco products, and about 11% of drinkers also use illicit drugs.
