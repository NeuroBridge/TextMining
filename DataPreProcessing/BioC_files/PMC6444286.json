In the first LME, we first tested for the interaction of clinical status (abstinent vs relapsed) and modulation of P(Stop) under each Go vs Stop trials (i.e, GoxP(stop) vs StopxPk(stop), SS and SE were averaged), with subject treated as random intercept effect. Whole brain statistical maps were obtained for the group main effect (reflecting areas tracking a clinical status group difference in prior P(stop) value irrespective of trial type) and the clinical status X P(stop) modulated trial type interaction. In order to assess for potential group difference in the modulation of trial accuracy (i.e., successful vs failed inhibition) by P(stop), a similar LME approach was used. Specifically, we obtained statistical maps for the main effect of clinical status (reflecting potential group difference in P(stop) activation on Stop trials irrespective of accuracy) and for the clinical status X P(stop) modulated trial type (SE vs SS) interaction. To correct for multiple comparisons, we used a cluster threshold adjustment based on Monte Carlo simulations (generated with AFNI's 3dClustSim program). We first calculated spatial autocorrelation function (acf) parameters from the 1st glm model residuals, using the 3dFHWMx function (which does not assume a purely Gaussian acf function, but rather a mixture of Gaussian and mono-exponential). The obtained parameters, averaged across participants, were fed to the 3dClustSim function to determine FWER corrected cluster size. Based on the simulations, a minimum cluster volume of 896\u202f\u03bcL was found to be sufficient to correct for multiple comparisons at FWER\u202f=\u202fp\u202f<\u202f.05 with a minimum voxelwise significant threshold of p\u202f<\u202f.005. While less conservative than using a p\u202f<\u202f.001 or p\u202f<\u202f.002 voxelwise threshold, this setting provides a balance of adequate correction for multiple comparisons while ensuring a substantial minimum cluster size. We also note that this threshold is still relatively conservative in light of previous work having applied this Bayesian computational model in similar populations and experimental settings, which would provide grounds for a more focused search within the brain based on regions of interest. Finally, within the regions identified with those LMEs, we identified those that were consistent with a potential group difference in either type of Bayesian prediction errors (UPE or SPE), using our second GLM for regions of interest (ROI) analyses. Moreover, for regions consistent with a group main effect or group X trial type interaction, we specifically checked for convergence between results from the second GLM and the pattern of activation to P(Stop) as function of trial type (first GLM). Specifically, regions with non-zero P(stop) activations of opposite signs or with the same signs across Go and Stop trials, should be consistent with a significant group difference in UPE and SPE activations, respectively. This is because an SPE is equal to 0 - P(stop)\u202f=\u202f\u2212 P(stop) on Go trials, and SPE\u202f=\u202f1 \u2013 P(stop) on Stop trials, and thus negatively correlated with P(stop) on both type of trials.

In addition, while abstinent individuals exhibited significant neural responses to P(stop) and an unsigned prediction error (UPE) on successfully inhibited trials in the left IFG and left anterior insula, relapsed individuals showed abnormalities in the tracking of UPE in those regions, with stronger UPE activation on failed but not successful trials.

With extensive connections to prefrontal and temporal lobes, the left angular gyrus has been implicated in encoding prediction errors and event frequencies within a Bayesian learning context, highlighting the role of this region in computationally-based learning. The observed negative as opposed to positive correlation between SPE and neural activity in this region highlights the relevance for relapse prediction of tracking this signed discrepancy specifically when observed stop frequency is lower than expectations (negative SPE). That is, because of its specific relevance to inhibitory/stop action tendency following belief adjustment, negative SPE activation may point to a specific vulnerability in flexibly implementing such action in relapsers. Interestingly, there is evidence pointing to structural abnormalities in the superior temporal region (i.e., lower grey matter volumes) as potential biological vulnerability to stimulant addiction.

Larger UPE deactivations, as observed in the left IFG and anterior insula, may thus reflect a stronger tracking of expectancy violation as unexpected changes in the environment statistics are being monitored. In both left IFG and left anterior insula, while abstinent individuals exhibited significant deactivations UPE, relapsed participants failed to show neural tracking of UPE when successfully inhibiting a motor response, but they instead exhibited such neural responses when failing to inhibit. This could suggest two things. First, relative to individuals who remained abstinent, relapsed individuals may be less efficient at maintaining internal monitoring of unexpected uncertainty in the environment while preforming well on the task. Second, failure to successfully inhibit motor response may more specifically prompt neural tracking of uncertainty in those regions among relapsed individuals, which could point to a more selective tracking of uncertainty and higher attentional threshold to trigger strategic shifts and adapt behavior in this subset of individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37609, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Indeed, several studies suggest that, while the right IFG is more robustly recruited during inhibitory control, the left IFG is also critical to response inhibition in SST and Go-NoGo tasks.

Similarly, prediction error and expectancy violation signals in reinforcement learning paradigms have been robustly observed in the insular cortex, and this region has been implicated in interoception and error-based learning within complex, uncertain environment. Again, the observed deactivation vs positive activation pattern, consistent with previous evidence of negative relationships between unsigned prediction errors and activity in cingulate cortex and IFG, is congruent with a downstream inhibitory role of UPE activation in this region, which may be relevant to prompt de-engagement from the current behavioral strategy. That is, those individuals prone to relapse show increased tracking of expectancy violation (i.e., appropriateness of the internal belief model guiding behavior), which is critical to guide shifts in attention away from an ineffective prediction strategy, in the face of failure, i.e., in a more reactive manner. In contrast, those more likely to remain abstinent appear to more consistently track this discrepancy between model-based beliefs and actual outcome when they are successfully performing, i.e., in a more pro-active manner.

This highlights the importance of distinguishing belief updating processes from expectancy violation and uncertainty monitoring, with growing computational evidence of distinct neural substrates. Interestingly, this pattern echoes a recent meta-analysis of reward prediction in substance abusers, pointing to weaker anticipation of reward and higher prediction error signals when receiving unexpected rewards. The similarity between this meta-analysis and our results further supports a learning impairment hypothesis, i.e. a problem of adapting behavior to a changing environment, generally consistent with a shift from model-based, goal-directed behavior to habitual decision-making associated with inflexible learning. We note, however, that this study has several limitations, including a small sample size, the fact that relapse/abstinence status was based on self-report, and that alcohol, prescription drugs, and other secondary drugs of abuse were not monitored after treatment. In addition, medical status, hospitalizations, and psychiatric comorbidities were not assessed during the follow-up interval. The latter limits our ability to evaluate the specificity of the neurocognitive markers identified to methamphetamine dependence and the role of psychiatric comorbidities in this predictive model. Future research should include a more in-depth clinical assessment to tease apart those factors. In addition, we acknowledge the group differences in Bayesian model-based neural responses were observed in the absence of statistically significant group difference in behavioral performance. However, the group by SSD interaction contrast predicting accuracy was marginally significant and pointing to more marked decline in performance as SSD shortens (i.e., more challenging) among relapsed individuals. Moreover, this lack of strong behavioral findings does not preclude the relevance of such subtle neural differences to inhibitory learning and/or the worsening of behavioral inhibitory performance as individuals progress towards relapse. It would thus be critical to assess behavioral performance at follow-up in future studies to assess the evolution of neural changes in anticipatory processes as it impacts performance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42016, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, the combination of functional neuroimaging and Bayesian cognitive modeling may be helpful in identifying finer neural markers for methamphetamine use disorder relapse, which can provide a mechanistic explanation of more subtle processing deficits. We note, however, that a group model fitting approach was adopted in this study to identify potential neurocognitive predictors of relapse at the individual level, and thus a more in-depth study of clinical prediction utility is warranted. Nonetheless, such generative embedding approach is a first step to help bridge the clinical predictive utility and the scientific requirement of mechanistic insight into cognition, which for instance is not realistically attainable with standard multivariate classification algorithms. Specifically, if robust to replication, and with the hope to refine such neurocomputational test to be more subpopulation- and individual-specific, this cognitive modeling approach may be useful to predict long-term relapse status at the individual level. Such approach may further be able to pinpoint specific predisposing deficits in a) the adequacy of individuals' internal predictive model, and/or b) the efficiency of experience-based learning. Given their relevance to addictive behavior and recent developments in computational psychiatry, such Bayesian computational framework could be further strengthened by considering: the degree of precision/confidence about goal attainment, which may further modulate the influence of expectancies on choice, and the balance between model-free vs model-based/goal-directed control in relation to Pavlovian-instrumental transfer effects. The observed computational markers may provide new avenues in the prevention of stimulant addiction and the development of personalized treatments. For instance, cognitive training and biofeedback may be used to specifically target the computational learning processes showing evidence of neural inefficiencies in combination with standard addiction rehabilitation programs for those individuals identified at risk of relapse.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44117, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44128, "infons": {"fpage": "e55", "lpage": "e68", "name_0": "surname:Aron;given-names:A.R.", "pub-id_pmid": "20932513", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Biol.
