The latter is functionally distinguished into higher-order networks, notably the CEN (concerned with maintenance and manipulation of goal-directed mental operations) and the SAL (involved in switching activity between the DMN to CEN) and in lower-order sensory and motor networks. Transition from childhood to adulthood typically is associated with changes in the intrinsic functional connectivity of these networks. For the DMN this entails greater intra-network cohesiveness and greater inter-network integration with the higher-order networks. Gu et al. proposed that this pattern of connectivity allows the DMN to function as cohesive driver of intrinsic brain function that supports a range of mental operations relating mostly to self-referential processes and spontaneous thought. The development of critical DMN connectivity may be disrupted in schizophrenia based on previous reports of reduced functional cohesiveness between DMN nodes and particularly the hippocampus, coupled with hyperconnectivty of the posterior DMN with brain regions outside the network.
