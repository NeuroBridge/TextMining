We obtained individual functional connectivity maps between a seed region of the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and all other brain regions and compared the functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) among the HC and 3 schizophrenia outcome groups, with a voxel-wise threshold of P\u202f<\u202f.001 within a cluster-extent threshold of 114 voxels. Additionally, we assessed correlations between functional connectivity and BPRS-18 scores. The SZ-MO and SZ-PO groups showed decreased functional connectivity between PCC and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), left middle cingulate cortex, and left frontopolar cortex (FPC) compared to the SZ-GO and HC groups. DMN connectivity in the right vmPFC and left FPC negatively correlated with subscale scores of the BPRS-18, except the negative symptoms subscale.

In this study, the DMN maps of patients with poorer outcome differed significantly from those of not only patients with better outcome but also healthy people. The differences in connectivity patterns of the DMN were observed in the right vmPFC, left MCC, and left FPC, which have been associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

Altered resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN in schizophrenia has been reported, but the results have been mixed. examined functional connectivity of the DMN using a seed-based approach and reported reduced PCC connectivity with the lateral parietal region, mPFC, precuneus, and cerebellum in schizophrenia. Some studies using independent component analysis have revealed reduced DMN connectivity in medial frontal areas. Our findings are partly consistent with these studies that reported hypo-connectivity of the DMN in schizophrenia. However, in contrast to these studies, several studies have observed hyper-connectivity of the DMN in schizophrenia. found increased DMN connectivity between the PCC and mPFC during resting blocks of a working memory task. reported increased PCC connectivity with the left inferior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus.

We also observed that the groups with worse clinical outcome showed more functional disability, implying that our classification of long-term outcome based on psychopathologic severity was appropriate. In the current study, patients with poorer clinical outcome demonstrated reduced DMN connectivity in the medial frontal areas compared to those with better outcome. Although there is no comparative study of long-term clinical outcome in schizophrenia, associations between DMN connectivity and social functioning have been reported by, who observed that stronger connectivity between PCC and mPFC was associated with better social attainment and social competence in patients with chronic schizophrenia; these results are consistent with our findings. Thus, our results suggest that alterations of DMN connectivity in the medial frontal areas might reflect outcome status in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the groups with poorer outcome might have included many patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, who had experienced a considerable level of psychotic symptoms despite longstanding antipsychotic treatment.

In this regard, effective connectivity analysis may be helpful in understanding the cortical hierarchies and distributed processes. used stochastic dynamic causal modelling (sDCM) of fMRI data to show that the excitatory influence of the posterior cingulate node on the anterior frontal node and the intrinsic inhibitory self-connection of the anterior cingulate node in the DMN were reduced in patients with schizophrenia. The reduced extrinsic connectivity in the sDCM study is consistent with hypo-connectivity of the DMN in this study.

Although we statistically controlled for these covariates, we could not exclude the possibility that these differences influenced the results.
