Different from previous studies, the longitudinal design enabled us to stratify the drinkers according to their onset of binge drinking. By identifying groups of extreme drinkers with the longest and the shortest histories of binge drinking in our sample, we were able to select the features that were associated with binge drinking and that also satisfied the hypothesis of trend. With such a hypothesis-guided feature selection, we imposed more constraints on the developmental course of any selected feature. Other substance use (e.g., cannabis) may have a different onset age compared with binge drinking, and thereby require its associated feature to have a different trend. In other words, our procedure could increase the specificity of the feature selection associated with binge drinking. As the selected features satisfy the hypothesis of trend, we expected to see an intermediate disruptive effect of these features in a medium-term history of binge drinking group; therefore, we confirmed our findings using an independent sample (i.e. the medium-term drinkers).
