In healthy adults, under highly automatic experimental conditions, the indirect semantic priming effect is minimal or absent altogether. This is for two reasons. First, the lexical nodes that describe the mappings between word-form and word meaning are finely tuned such that a particular word-form (e.g. the orthography, p-r-i-e-s-t) maps precisely on to its semantic features and those of its direct associates via a specific lexical representation.

Second, in healthy adults, the spread of automatic activity within semantic memory is thought to be constrained and self-limited (perhaps because of inhibitory mechanisms), and so the automatic pre-activation of a prime\u2019s directly related semantic features does not, in turn, spread activity to that prime\u2019s indirectly related semantic features.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4721, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In contrast to healthy adults, people with schizophrenia can show a significant automatic indirect semantic priming effect (e.g.).

Thus, when a prime word pre-activates semantic features of its direct semantic associates, this activity spreads further to pre-activate semantic features of its indirect semantic associates.

This account is depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 1B. It holds that these form-meaning (lexical) mappings are weaker and less finely-tuned in people with schizophrenia than in healthy adults (; ). For example, in healthy controls, the lexical representation, BELL, encodes tight mappings between the semantic features, <bell>, and the specific word-form, b-e-l-l. In schizophrenia, however, the lexical representation, BELL, might encode looser mappings between <bell> and both b-e-l-l and p-r-i-e-s-t.

Therefore, this account does not predict that an enhanced automatic indirect priming effect in schizophrenia should necessarily be accompanied by an enhanced direct priming effect. Second, it allows for bottom-up activity to flow from a particular word-form (e.g. p-r-i-e-s-t) to pre-activate the lexical representation of its indirect semantic associate (BELL) without necessarily pre-activating its semantic features.

However, as discussed above (in relation to why we saw no direct automatic priming effect in the control group), in these older adult participants, under these highly automatic experimental conditions, there may not have been enough time for activity from the masked prime to reach all the way up to pre\u00adactivate features at the semantic level. The \u2018noisy lexical representation\u2019 account, however, predicts that the indirect semantic priming effect in schizophrenia can occur at the lexical level of representation. This is because, according to this theory, the lexical representation, BELL, encodes not only mappings between the word-form, b-e-l-l, and the semantic features, <bell>, but also between the word-form, p-r-i-e-s-t, and the semantic features, <bell>. It is therefore possible for automatic bottom-up activity to flow from the prime, p-r-i-e-s-t, to pre-activate the lexical representation, BELL, even if this flow of activity doesn\u2019t reach the level of semantic features. Consistent with this idea, our fMRI findings show that the automatic indirect semantic effect in schizophrenia localized to the left fusiform cortex - a region that has been implicated in lexical processing at the interface between orthographic form and semantic features, and that is distinct from the anterior lateral temporal cortex that is associated with processing at the semantic level. Note that, as outlined in the Introduction and in Fig. 1, the \u2018noisy lexical representations\u2019 account predicts that the automatic indirect semantic priming effect in schizophrenia can also occur at the level of semantic features.

One theory is that they arise as a long-term consequence of an abnormally large semantic prediction error in response to incoming stimuli in schizophrenia (for general discussion, see; for discussion in relation to language processing, see). During normal language comprehension, healthy adults are thought to generate precise top-down predictions both at the level of semantic features and word-form, particularly in semantically constraining contexts. This means that incoming words that fulfill such predictions (e.g. the word, \u201cpriest\u201d, following the context, \u201cThe man went to confession and confessed his sins to the\u2026 \u201c) will not produce a prediction error, either the level of word-form or semantic features (see). In schizophrenia, however, top-down predictions during language comprehension tend to be less precise and more dependent on general semantic relationships between individual words, rather than precise discourse representations of context (e.g.; ). Thus, following the context above, people with schizophrenia may be more likely to weakly pre-activate general schema-related semantic features (e.g. <church>, <priest>, <bell>), without pre-activating upcoming word-forms. Thus, in people with schizophrenia, new bottom-up predictable input (\u201cpriest\u201d) would evoke a relatively large prediction error at the level of the word-form, p-r-i-e-s-t (because this word-form prediction was not generated at all), a small prediction error over the semantic features corresponding to <priest> and <church> (because these features were partially predicted), and the largest prediction error over the semantic features corresponding to <bell> (because these predicted semantic features mismatch those associated with the bottom-up input). There is evidence that prediction error triggers learning/adaptation, both in the language domain (e.g.) and in non-linguistic domains (e.g.). Thus, over the longer term, an abnormally large prediction error to p-r-i-e-s-t and <bell> in schizophrenia might lead to adaptation such that the word-form, p-r-i-e-s-t, develops new connections to the semantic features of its indirect associates (<bell>), leading to noisier lexical representations, just as depicted in Figs. 1B and 7. In other words, abnormally increased prediction error in schizophrenia might interfere with the maintenance of stable, precise lexical connections between the meanings and forms of words, leading to broader connections. Indeed, we have argued that sustained, abnormally increased prediction error may lead to weaker, less precise mappings across at multiple levels of the linguistic hierarchy in schizophrenia (see  for a review, and for evidence of abnormal top-down predictive effects at other levels of linguistic representation in schizophrenia, see Rabagliati et al.

While our fMRI results are likely to have captured the indirect priming effect on target words (because the prime was fully counterbalanced across conditions and participants), fMRI does not have the necessary temporal resolution to tell us when exactly this modulation occurred in relation to the target\u2019s onset; in theory, it could have reflected activity within or after the N400 time window.

Word knowledge is depicted at three levels of representation: word-form (here, illustrated as\northographic form), semantic features (here, we use < > around a word to indicate a set of\nconceptual features associated with that word), and lexical representations, which describe the\nmappings/connections that link semantic features and word-form. Solid lines are used to indicate these mappings/connections, with\nthe thickness of the lines depicting the strength of these connections. Red arrows are used to indicate the flow of information\nafter encountering a prime word, \u201cpriest\u201d. A illustrates an unconstrained spread of activity across semantic memory\nin schizophrenia. Just as in healthy adults, the lexical representations are precise \u2013 that is, the mappings between the\nmeaning of a particular word and its word-form are strong (depicted as thick lines) and finely-tuned (1:1 mappings). However,\nactivity spreads further across semantic memory than in healthy controls. Thus, in healthy controls, after encountering a\nparticular prime word (e.g. \u201cpriest\u201d), activity flows from the prime\u2019s form (here depicted as p-r-i-e-s-t) to\nits specific lexical representation (PRIEST), and to its semantic features (<priest>) as well as directly associated\nsemantic features (< church >). In schizophrenia, the pre-activation of the directly associated semantic features\n(<church>), in turn, spreads activity to the semantic features of its own associates (e.g. <bell>).\nThis flow of activity is depicted with red arrows. This means that if the indirectly related target word, \u201cbell\u201d,\nappears very quickly after the prime, its processing will be facilitated at the level of semantic features, leading to an enhanced\nautomatic indirect semantic priming effect. B illustrates noisier lexical representations in schizophrenia. The mappings between\nsemantic features and word-form are weaker (depicted as thinner/fainter lines) and less finely-tuned (no 1:1 mappings) than in\nhealthy adults, perhaps as a long-term consequence of adapting to sustained abnormal prediction error at the level of word-form\nand semantic features (see Discussion). Here, the lexical representation, BELL, encodes\nmappings between <bell> and both b-e-l-l and p-r-i-e-s-t. Thus, after encountering the prime word,\n\u201cpriest\u201d, there is a direct route through which bottom-up activity can flow from its orthographic form (p-r-i-e-s-t)\nto pre-activate its indirectly related lexical representation (BELL) and its indirectly related semantic features\n(<bell>). This flow of activity is depicted with red arrows. This means that if the indirectly related target word,\n\u201cbell\u201d, appears very quickly after the prime, its processing can be facilitated at both the lexical\nlevel and the semantic level.
