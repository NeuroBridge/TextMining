While networks were relatively robust and not significantly changed in follow-up analyses controlling for other factors, we cannot entirely exclude the effects of other clinical variables, such as concurrent use of other substances or even acute intoxication, on connectivity strength. Given the relatively limited temporal specificity of urine toxicology analyses, future studies should consider incorporation of salivary testing for acute drug effects. In addition, further work will be needed to determine generalizability of these findings to fMRI data acquired during performance of different tasks and/or while the brain is \u2018at-rest\u2019. To avoid circularity, we did not test the ability of pre-treatment data to predict abstinence during follow-up; however, this will be an important next step for future studies. To facilitate replication, we have made the positive and negative abstinence network masks publicly available at our website (to be posted upon manuscript publication).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28100, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Identified networks accounted for just under 20% of the variance in within treatment abstinence for novel subjects.
