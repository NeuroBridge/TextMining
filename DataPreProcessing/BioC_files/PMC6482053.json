The precise mechanisms of WM and their relationship between WM deficits with other clinical symptoms of schizophrenia remain unclear. Contemporary models propose that WM requires synchronous activity across brain regions within a distributed network, including lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and task-relevant posterior sensory cortical regions. This suggests that WM deficits in patients may be due to PFC functional connectivity (FC) impairments rather than activation impairments per se. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the magnitude of FC between lateral PFC and visual cortex and univariate activations within these regions during visual WM. We found decreased FC in patients compared to healthy subjects in the context of similar levels of univariate activity. Furthermore, this decreased FC was associated with task performance and clinical symptomatology in patients. The magnitude of FC, particularly during the delay period, was positively correlated with WM task accuracy, while FC during cue was inversely correlated with severity of disorganization. Taken together, these results suggest that impairment in lateral PFC FC is a key aspect of information processing impairment in patients with schizophrenia, and may be a sensitive index of altered neurophysiology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1564, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1577, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Schizophrenia is a chronic illness that usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood. It is associated with significant cognitive impairment, which often manifests before the onset of psychotic symptoms. Impairments in working memory (WM), which can be defined as the \u201cability to hold an item of information transiently in mind in the service of comprehension, thinking, and planning\u201d, are considered particularly important indications of cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. Consequently, WM is amongst the most commonly studied cognitive processes in patients with schizophrenia. While a variety of brain abnormalities and neural correlates associated with WM deficits in patients with schizophrenia have been documented, dysfunction of the lateral PFC is often viewed as one of the most critical. However, the mechanisms of how lateral PFC dysfunction translates into WM deficits remains unclear. Furthermore, whether WM related neural deficits could give rise to some of the clinical symptomatology of schizophrenia also remains unclear. A demonstration of an association between WM related neural deficits and clinical symptoms would advance the broader effort to discover the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia in a number of ways. On a conceptual level, it would offer empirical evidence of a link between deficits in the realm of cognition with other domains of clinical symptomatology, potentially offering a common framework with which to conceptualize and study the diverse set of symptoms constituting schizophrenia.

However, cognitive processes such as WM are not the result of activity in a singular brain region, but rather are the products of synchronous activity occurring between two or more brain regions. This synchronous activity is referred to as functional connectivity (FC) and can be quantified as the magnitude of correlation between fMRI signal time series from two brain regions. Numerous basic WM studies with healthy individuals have documented the enhancement of FC of the PFC with task-relevant cortical regions during WM.These models propose that WM is supported by enhanced FC between the lateral PFC and task-relevant sensory cortical areas, wherein representations of the memoranda are maintained and enhanced under lateral PFC guidance. This framework offers a number of advantages for clinical translational efforts. It is well-suited to be paired with ROI- to- ROI based FC analytic methods. These methods can be advantageous since they offer enhanced sensitivity due to the reduced need for multiple comparisons correction and better control for Type II errors compared to seed-based, whole brain FC methods.

The design of our visual object WM task temporally segregates the phases of cue, delay, and probe. In this manner, this task can be considered a variant of the Sternberg Task. This design was chosen over a traditional N-back task in which the three phases cannot be temporally separated. There were two tasks in this paradigm, which were identical in terms of trial structure, stimulus presentations, order and timing, but differed in WM requirements. The first stimulus presented in both tasks is referred to as the \u201ccue\u201d face. It was displayed for one second and then it was replaced by a crosshair. The color of the crosshair was initially black, but changed color after two seconds. This new color indicated the task of the trial: blue indicated the WM task, which required subjects to maintain the cue face in WM across a 15 s delay period and to make a match discrimination with the face appearing at the end of the delay; red indicated the Gender ID (GID) task, which did not require WM for task completion but rather for the subjects to make a gender discrimination of the face appearing at the end of the delay period. The faces shown were chosen to be gender ambiguous, so the results from the GID task are not expected to be meaningful. A critical aspect of the design was that the task for a particular trial was revealed only after cue face offset. This design forced subjects to encode into WM a cue face whenever it appeared, even during GID trials. Furthermore, the trial task was revealed two seconds, and not immediately, after cue offset in order to enhance the temporal separation between the engagement of encoding and maintenance related neural processes by the subject. This temporal separation is necessary to disambiguate the BOLD signal reflecting encoding and maintenance related events. Subjects completed 40 trials of each task.

This approached required specifying a priori the ROIs to be analyzed (lateral PFC and ventral visual cortex). We utilized functional ROIs, rather than anatomic ROIs, for hypothesis testing to enhance sensitivity to detect true effects. The lateral PFC is a relatively broad region that encompasses functionally heterogeneous sub-regions. Thus, the use of anatomically defined ROIs of the lateral PFC would likely significantly diminish our ability to detect WM-specific fMRI signal. One of the major challenges in functional localization is the \u201ccurse of circularity\u201d. This problem arises when fMRI data that is not independent from the fMRI data to be analyzed is used to identify or define ROIs used in the analysis. We avoided this problem by using scans independent of WM scans, e.g. GID scans, to localize ROIs and used these ROIs to interrogate WM scans. We first generated within-group activation maps (one map for HC and one map for SZ) (Figure 2) which were defined by the contrast of GID cue vs. implicit baseline.
