To date, the vast majority of research on the biological origins of psychopathology has focused on discrete illness categories, studied in isolation. Although modern psychiatric diagnoses provide advantages to the field in terms of diagnostic reliability, their construct validity and utility for understanding brain circuit dysfunction has been challenged. Converging epidemiologic, genetic, and neuroscientific research suggests that populations of psychiatric patients are not separated by clear neurobiological borders between diagnostic categories or across health and disease. There is evidence, for example, of substantial overlap in the genetic factors that increase risk for both affective and psychotic illness. Consistent with shared heritability, partially overlapping patterns of brain network dysfunction mark a broad range of mental diseases, indicating that their breakdown can lead to diverse forms of psychopathology.

Complex clinical phenotypes arise from coordinated interactions throughout the functional connectome. High comorbidity across illnesses suggests the presence of dimensional network-level abnormalities that bridge across traditional diagnostic constructs.

In depression, for example, deficits on neuropsychological measures of executive functioning track both the severity of current symptoms in patients, as well as the use of psychotropic medications. Suggesting the likely presence of preillness shifts in network connectivity, prefrontal dysfunctions related to context processing have been identified in never-medicated patients with schizophrenia early in the course of the illness. Highlighting a degree of symptom specificity, in a study of psychotic patients with and without cognitive dysfunction, we recently reported that distinct frontoparietal subnetworks may link to cognitive capacity (i.e., control A subnetwork) and psychiatric symptoms (i.e., control B subnetwork), respectively. Across development the human brain experiences distinct functional changes as network modules become more segregated with age. Impairments in this process of network differentiation, for example between default and executive (frontoparietal) networks, are linked to dimensions of psychopathology that cross traditional diagnostic boundries.

Rather, our data support the view that default network functions may underlie a set of cognitive processes impaired in multiple disorders, with variability in network-level functioning linking with corresponding network-associated symptom expression. Patients with unipolar depression, for example, have been found to display aberrant intrinsic connectivity as well as heightened stimulus-induced activity in aspects of the default network while viewing and reappraising negative images. These data are consistent with our observation of increased default D subnetwork connectivity in nontreatment-seeking individuals with depression, a functional profile that was absent in treatment-seeking patients recruited from clinical units.

Rather, our results likely reflect a general role for aspects of frontoparietal and default networks in the regulation of cognitive processes that broadly underlie affective and psychotic illness. While it may not be feasible to identify isolated features of brain biology that cleanly distinguish populations of patients with psychiatric illness, multivariate fingerprints of pathology may eventually emerge. To establish such points of separation, our data collection and analytic efforts need to incorporate dimensional measures of clinical severity across a broad range of patient populations, recruited from diverse clinical settings at varying phases of illness. To generate such high-dimensional datasets, we will need to reassess our current scientific approach, extending beyond conventional clinic- or research laboratory-specific collection efforts.

To make progress in this domain, our clinical recruitment strategies and analytic efforts will need to coordinate across research laboratories to standardize imaging acquisition protocols, as well as dense demographic, symptom, and behavioral batteries. Additionally, while we can compare and contrast treatment-seeking and nontreatment-seeking individuals with unipolar depression, we are unable to account for other factors that may contribute to access to care and utilization. For example, the nontreatment-seeking individuals with depression were not currently taking psychiatric medications. This is in contrast to individuals already in treatment who were prescribed varying forms of psychiatric medication. Moreover, lack of insight, as well as internalized and treatment stigma, can associate with reduced help seeking in some patient populations. Consequently, despite evaluating over 1,000 individuals, we are limited in the conclusions we can draw when comparing and contrasting the connectomic profiles observed in nontreatment-seeking individuals recruited from the community versus populations of patients recruited from partial and inpatient hospitalization programs. Smaller-scale longitudinal studies suggest the presence of abnormal functional connectivity in individuals presenting to the emergency room seeking care for schizophrenia or related diagnoses, even before starting psychiatric medication. Moreover, connectomic changes are apparent in early phases of antipsychotic treatment.
