Previous findings in fact suggest greater disturbances in fronto-striatal control processes in chronic cannabis-using adults who became frequent users at early relative to later ages. We detected an uncorrected association between age of first regular use and fronto-striatal connectivity. Although in need of replication, these findings suggest that disruption in fronto-striatal functioning may be greater and more persistent if chronic cannabis use is initiated during adolescence, when these circuits are still undergoing maturation. Alternatively, pre-existing fronto-striatal abnormalities may also contribute to the early initiation and maintenance of cannabis use, consistent with findings that reduced OFC volumes at age 12 predict initiation of cannabis use by age 16.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25874, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present study is limited by its modest sample size, reducing our power to detect effects and precluding thorough examination of potential confounding effects (e.g., age, gender, IQ, SES) and their interactions with cannabis use on our behavioral and brain outcome measures. For example, including age and gender as covariates in our behavioral analyses revealed a main effect of age but no effect of conflict, suggesting that age rather than stimulus type accounted for most of the variance in reaction times across groups. Studies of larger samples are required to properly assess the effects of age and conflict-related processes in healthy and cannabis-using youth. Further, given the low power due to our modest sample size, some of the findings reported herein were not corrected for multiple tests and should thus be interpreted with much caution until replicated in a larger sample. In addition, aspects of cannabis use (i.e., frequency of use, abstinence, age of first regular use and duration of use) were based on self-reports. While informative, such measures may be subject to errors or biases in recall due to current neural functioning, psychopathology, current mood, personality, or other factors Future studies could incorporate ecological momentary assessment measures (e.g., using smart phones) of daily cannabis use and other relevant variables over an extended period of time. The cross-sectional study design also precluded examining longitudinal trajectories of fronto-striatal functioning associated with development, long-term chronic use and recovery. In addition, the correlational study design further limits our conclusions pertaining to the specific nature of the relationships observed between cannabis use and fronto-striatal function (e.g., causal or transactional relationships). Thus, future longitudinal studies in larger and more diverse samples should replicate and extend the findings presented herein.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27819, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite these potential caveats, our findings of altered conflict-related fronto-striatal function in relation to cannabis use in adolescents have important implications for our understanding of adolescent development and the risks/consequences associated with cannabis use. Indeed, due to the various neurobiological changes associated with this sensitive developmental period, an earlier onset of regular use may linearly predict (or result from) alterations in fronto-striatal circuits. The present findings set the stage for future longitudinal studies aimed at understanding the developmental trajectory of fronto-striatal circuits in relation to CUD, as well as to SUD in general, and are a first step towards identifying circuit-based targets for early interventions that reduce addiction behaviors by enhancing self-regulatory capacity. Given that substance use and relapse rates are associated with control processes,interventions based on neural stimulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and behavioral interventions, such as cognitive training, that specifically target fronto-striatal circuits may be helpful as adjunct intervention strategies to complement standard treatment programs for CUD as well as SUDs in general.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29073, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29096, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
