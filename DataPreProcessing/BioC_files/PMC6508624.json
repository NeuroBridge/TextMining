This finding supports a role of the anterior insular cortex in pre-attentive processing of emotional salience. Using an MMN/field paradigm, Ford et al. reported significantly reduced right hemisphere fronto-temporal and insular cortex activation in a \u201chigh social disorganization\u201d group sharing autistic and schizotypal phenotypes, and indicated that right fronto-temporal and insular cortex-related auditory change processing may be associated with psychosocial functioning. The insular cortex not only relays information to and from somatosensory, auditory, and visual areas and the amygdala, which has been suggested to be involved in emotion and fear processing, but is among the secondary auditory cortices, with connections to the STG and dorsal superior temporal sulcus. The posterior insular cortex is part of the extended auditory cortex and preferentially responds to vocal commutation. The detection of auditory changes in the primary auditory cortex triggers a pre-attentive reorienting response in the right frontal lobe, with feedback to the auditory sensory regions through connections between the IFG and STG. Changes in the structure of the insular cortex have been identified in patients with schizophrenia and autism. Connections between these regions may be disrupted in schizophrenia, disrupting feedback pathways from the IFG to the STG, suggesting a deficit in the connection between the auditory processing regions and the IFG.

These results are in line with previous studies that suggested the ACC is a source of MMN. Takahashi et al. examined the neural sources of MMN and P3a components in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia using exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (eLORETA) and comparing them to non-psychiatric control subjects. Reduced activation of discrete medial frontal brain regions, including the anterior\u2013posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyri, were associated with MMN deficits, whereas deficits in P3a were associated with reduced activation of attentional networks (i.e., frontal, temporal, and parietal regions). Their results support the hypothesis that a distributed neural architecture supporting initial auditory sensory discrimination, such as MMN processing, is similar in patients with schizophrenia, but impairments in the medial frontal region devolve into generalized neurocognitive deficits. Among the core neurophysiological features of schizophrenia is abnormal activation of medial frontal areas, including the cingulate cortex and medial frontal gyrus, accounting for several distinct cognitive deficits. The associations between ACC structure and the mismatched BOLD response in the right STG or total PANSS scores observed in this study are consistent with hierarchical information processing models of cognitive deficits that have been proposed for patients with schizophrenia. In schizophrenia, impaired automatic stimulus discrimination may contribute to the higher-order cognitive and psychosocial deficits, and changes in ACC structure may be part of the neural basis of MMN changes and disruption of the limbic-cortical structural networks.

There is also a need for stricter noise reduction of raw EEG data by reprocessing the data, as insufficient artifact correction may have contributed to the negative findings related to MMN amplitude or latency.

A broader range of ROIs including the limbic system, STG, and IFG should help elucidate the impaired connection between the STG, ACC, and insula in schizophrenia.
