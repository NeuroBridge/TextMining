A recently emerging, more powerful technique, dynamic functional connectivity (DFC), studies how the FC dynamics change during the course of the fMRI experiments. The aim in this paper was to develop a computational approach, using a machine learning framework, to determine if DFC features were more successful than FC features in the classification of cocaine-dependent patients and healthy controls. fMRI data were obtained from of 25 healthy and 58 cocaine-dependent participants while performing a motor response inhibition task, stop signal task. Group independent component analysis was carried out on all participant data to compute spatially independent components (ICs). Eight ICs were selected manually as relevant brain networks, which were used to classify healthy versus cocaine-dependent participants. FC and DFC measures of the chosen IC pairs were used as features for the classification algorithm. Support Vector Machines were used for both feature selection/reduction and participant classification. Based on DFC with only seven IC pairs, participants were successfully classified with 95% accuracy (and with 90% accuracy with three IC pairs), whereas static FC yielded only 81% accuracy. Visual, sensorimotor, default mode, and executive control networks, amygdala, and insula played the most significant role in the DFC-based classification.

For example, the methodology of functional connectivity (FC) was first applied in the addiction field only about a decade ago, relatively recently, given its first use in 1995.

Motor response inhibition is a function that has been closely associated with impulsiveness and has been consistently found to be impaired in patients with addiction, including cocaine addiction. SST assesses the countermanding of a prepotent motor response to go signals, when the go signals are unexpectedly followed by stop signals. The task response is a modified version of the classic go/no-go task. SST has a higher load on inhibitory control than the go/no-go task, which requires selective attention and selective response inhibition to some trials and not others. As a result, the SST, which measures \u201ccontrolled inhibition,\u201d is a more difficult motor inhibition task than go/no-go task, which measures \u201cautomatic inhibition\u201d. Furthermore, the tracking SST is particularly challenging since it is titrated to the inhibitory performance of the participant. Nonetheless, since response inhibition is highly relevant in substance abuse and addiction, both tasks are widely used in neuroimaging of substance abuse and addiction since they assess how well a participant can inhibit his/her response and functional neuroimaging methods such as fMRI during the performance of these tasks can capture brain regions\u2019 responses that mediate inhibitory control, such as inferior frontal cortex, sensorimotor area, subthalamic nucleus, more consistently than the go/no-go task. Combining dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) with a task that is more closely aligned with the phenotypic cognitive deficit of impulse control is also more meaningful than using resting-state data. The goal of this study was hence to examine differentiations of brain functional connectivity (FC) in cocaine-dependent participants relative to healthy controls using DFC applied to fMRI data during a task which is highly relevant to addiction, i.e., during inhibition performance (that is indicative of impulse control) in an SST.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4790, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, fMRI data collected from cocaine-dependent individuals and healthy controls during the SST experiments were utilized to develop a statistical model to separate healthy controls from cocaine-dependent participants based on only the fMRI data. A data-driven entropy-based algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA), was used to extract spatially independent brain regions (independent components, ICs) in cocaine-dependent and control participants. Since these regions play significant roles in recognition of being addicted or healthy, a machine learning/pattern classification method was trained and applied to separate control participants from the cocaine-dependent participants. ICA is one of the most widely used methods to analyze the functional organization of the brain in terms of two complementary principles, localization (segregation) and connectionism (integration). ICA decomposes data into statistically independent components by assuming that observations are linear mixtures of independent sources. ICA then utilizes higher order statistics to decompose data iteratively, and the output of ICA are components with maximal mutual independence. In fMRI applications of ICA, data are viewed as a two-dimensional (2D) spatio-temporal matrix obtained by flattening the four-dimensional (4D) fMRI data. A 2D spatio-temporal matrix can be separated into either spatially or temporally independent components.

DFC among insula, visual, sensorimotor, executive control, and ventral default-mode networks resulted in high (95%) classification accuracy and appear to be the most informative features to classify cocaine-dependent patients from healthy controls. This result points to consistent differences between the two groups in the temporal dynamics of the functional connectivity among these networks, which may further suggest that these interactions may be altered or impaired. Involvement, alteration and possible impairment, in cocaine dependence, of temporal and visual regions as well as regions involved in executive control networks such as the prefrontal cortex, is in line with existing literature. ECN and DMN, and their functional coupling in particular, were also shown to be involved and possibly impaired in cocaine addiction and also in other types of addiction, such as nicotine addiction. More recent functional connectivity studies found disruptions or differences in the brain networks which include default mode network, salience network, prefrontal cortex, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex in cocaine-dependent participants. The top discriminating network pairs we found in this study, which included brain regions of insula, default mode network, sensorimotor, and executive control networks, are in line with the networks which have been reported to be disrupted in cocaine dependence.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34603, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The choice of window size and window step size are important in DFC analyses; however, there is not an established or optimal choice, and they are still subject to exploration and experimentation. In general, it is advised that the window size be long enough to have enough number of samples such that the computed correlation values carry a significance and not too short to have any spurious fluctuations. Statistically speaking, one needs at least n > 30 samples (time points) in the window in order to have the correlation coefficients to have a statistically significant meaning (stems from the fact that the t-distribution and the Normal distribution values are almost the same for n > 30). On the other hand, the window should not be too long, i.e., it should be short enough to capture any real, genuine dynamics of FC, otherwise the dynamics would be averaged out. In our study, we set the window size to 32 (54.4 s), which is within the generally suggested range of window length. A recent study indicated that artifacts might occur if the time courses are not filtered to remove frequencies lower than 1/window length. According to these findings, since our window length is 54.4 s, time course frequencies below 1/54.4 = 0.018 Hz might generate spurious fluctuations. However, our fMRI data is not at resting state, but we have an SST task, the frequencies related to the task signals (with ISI 1.6 s, 1.8 s, 2.0 s) which correspond to a frequency range of 0.5\u20130.625 Hz are much stronger than those of any artifacts or noise (low frequency artifactual signals are also mostly filtered out during the preprocessing stage). A spectral density analysis showed that, for the eight ICs that we used in our DFC analyses, the frequencies between 0 and 0.018 Hz have only 4.7% of the total spectral power on the average, and this percentage did not differ significantly between the groups. Choice of eight steps (13.6 s) for the window step size was somewhat arbitrary; too short of a step size (e.g., 1 or 2) would mean too much overlap (>90%) of the windows and also too many dynamic (DFC) data points. Our choice of step size results in 75% overlapping windows, which allows capturing the dynamics of transitions in DFC between the windows. In summary, we also wanted to keep a balance between having too short or too long windows size and step size. The choice of a fixed window size limits the analysis to the fluctuations in the frequency range below the window size, independently of the true frequency content of dynamics of FC. The \u201coptimal\u201d choice of window length and step size in sliding window DFC analysis of fMRI is still under debate and subject to ongoing research.

The brain is a highly interconnected organ, many different brain regions constantly communicate and interact, and the dynamics of the interactions as captured with fMRI and DFC in some or all of these brain regions can be systematically different for different brain conditions versus the \u201cnormal healthy\u201d brain. Isolating these changes in DFC to a few interactions between a few brain regions is of particular interest for focusing diagnosis and treatment strategies to a small number of regions, and isolating the few brain regions which still provide the maximum classification of brain condition can provide clues about what the extent of these brain networks can be. Therefore, in this work, we wanted to find the smallest number of brain networks and IC pairs which provide the maximum classification accuracy via DFC. The classification accuracy decreased to 83% for six pairs and decreased to 90%\u221293% for five, four, and three pairs, which shows that the seven found IC pairs, and the networks which constitute these pairs (as listed above), are all important for classification of cocaine dependence.

certain brain networks in discriminating cocaine-dependent patients from controls, using independent component analysis, dynamic functional connectivity, and multivariate pattern classification of fMRI data. The networks include visual, sensorimotor, executive control networks and the default mode network (DMN). These findings support the use of fMRI dynamic connectivity analyses as a tool for searching potential neuroimaging biomarkers of cocaine addiction. It also reinforces that visual, sensorimotor, executive control networks, and the DMN are among the networks which are potentially most involved, possibly altered or impaired, in cocaine addiction. Our results can help addiction researchers focus more attention on these networks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
