Seventy-five adults with longitudinal assessments of cannabis use (60 with reported use, 15 with no reported use) and prenatal drug exposure assessment completed a spatial WM task during fMRI at age 28. All subjects passed a multi-drug urine screen on the day of testing and denied recreational drug use in the past week. A fast event-related design with partial trials was used to separate the BOLD response associated with encoding, maintenance, and retrieval periods of the WM task. Behavioral results showed that subjects who began using cannabis earlier in adolescence had longer reaction times (RT) than those with later initiation. Cannabis age of onset was further associated with reduced posterior parietal cortex (PPC) encoding BOLD activation, which significantly mediated age of onset WM RT associations. However, cannabis age of onset brain-behavior associations did not differ between groups with a single reported use and those with repeated use, suggesting age of onset effects may reflect substance use risk characteristics rather than a developmentally-timed cannabis exposure effect. Within repeated cannabis users, greater levels of total cannabis use were associated with performance-related increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation during maintenance. This pattern of significant results remained unchanged with inclusion of demographic and prenatal measures as covariates. Surprisingly, however, at the group level, cannabis users generally performed better than participants who reported never using cannabis (faster RT, higher accuracy). We extend previous investigations by identifying that WM associations with cannabis age of onset may be primary to PPC stimulus encoding activity, while the amount of cannabis use is associated with DLPFC maintenance processes.

We also utilized an approach to characterize specific epochs of the WM task to better identify which cognitive processes may be associated with age of onset and total cannabis use. However, several limitations should also be noted. First, this study utilized a high-risk prospective cohort sample with varying degrees of cannabis use throughout adolescence and adulthood. Accordingly, participants were not excluded from the study based on previous cannabis use, unless they had a positive urine screen on the day of testing or reported recreational drug use in the past week. In our analyses examining the REP group, in which fifteen subjects reported cannabis use in the last year, we covaried cannabis use within the last year. However, future investigations with larger samples should further investigate associations between cannabis use history, recent cannabis use, and neurocognitive function. An additional limitation of the study was the binary threshold (positive/negative) for the urine screen. Future work may utilize drug screening procedures that provide a more dimensional biological measure of recent cannabis use and examine whether this moderates cannabis age of onset and cumulative cannabis use WM associations. Finally, although cannabis use was prospectively assessed (cohort years 14-, 16-, 22-, 28-years-old), the interview only asked about the previous year. Usage in the intervening years was not measured. Accordingly, two participants who reported the same use at an assessment year (e.g., age 28) could have varied in their usage in the years between other assessment phases. Future work with prospective longitudinal assessment should incorporate more frequent assessments of cannabis use in order to better estimate total cannabis use trajectories. Despite these limitations, the current project highlights the value in examining associations between cannabis use and cognitive function in adults with longitudinal cannabis use history and prenatal substance exposure assessments.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50740, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50751, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results support evidence suggesting that reported early cannabis use in the adolescent period is associated with individual differences in the parietal cortex in adulthood. We extend this line of inquiry by providing evidence that cannabis age of onset may be specifically associated with information processing speed and stimulus encoding. However, this pattern of results was evident in both those who reported a onetime use and those with repeated use, suggesting these effects may represent pre-onset substance use risk characteristics rather than cannabis exposure effects. In contrast, our results suggested total cannabis use may be specifically associated with processes underlying the ability to maintain information in WM through the DLPFC, independent of cannabis age of onset.
