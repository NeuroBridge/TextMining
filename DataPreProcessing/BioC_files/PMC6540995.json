Not all adolescents engage in risky behavior, however, and here we found that differences during childhood in NAcc activation to the anticipation of winning money predicted who would go on to use drugs and/or alcohol at an early age. This finding is consistent with prior work by Galvan and colleagues that found the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior was significantly positively correlated with NAcc activity to large vs. small monetary gain. Associations between VS activity and risky decisions have also been found in adults. The present findings are consistent with these adult and adolescent studies and extend the potential association between VS activity and risk-taking behavior, such as early substance use, to children.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24908, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As described previously, the MID task is characterized by an incentive cue followed by an anticipatory phase, a response target, and then feedback. The present study focused on the anticipation of large gains and large losses compared to neutral anticipation (i.e., no money at stake). Some reports indicate that activation of the VS to the anticipation of both monetary gains and losses supports the role of motivational salience in addiction risk. Other research suggests that two different systems underlie brain activation to the anticipation of gains and losses. According to this latter view, the anticipation of gain elicits a dopaminergic response from the mesolimbic reward pathway, whereas loss anticipation is thought to be associated to a greater extent with serotonergic responding as a function of behavioral inhibition and risk aversion. Although it was not possible in the present study to test the biochemical processes associated with brain activation, our findings demonstrating a significant positive effect of NAcc activation to monetary gain and a negative effect trending towards significance for NAcc activation to monetary loss point to the possibility of different neural mechanisms involved in gain versus loss in terms of substance use outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26182, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A number of strengths of this study are worth noting. First, we scanned subjects at a very early age (i.e., 8.2\u201312.9 years), ensuring that we would be able to characterize the neural correlates of reward anticipation before any experimentation with drugs or alcohol took place. This is particularly important given evidence that substance use may have diffuse effects on reward processing and extend to other types of rewards (e.g.,). Second, because the initiation of alcohol, marijuana, or substance use in general before the age of 16 conveys greater risk for later social, emotional, and physical problems, we only included subjects for whom we had substance use data after the age of 16 in order to ensure that they had aged out of the window of highest risk for these problems. Finally, we controlled for other common predictors of substance use initiation, namely FH and externalizing behaviors. These constructs have been shown to convey a significant risk for later SUDs and problems. For instance, one study found that family history conferred an 8-fold risk for SUD. Another study found significantly increased odds of regular alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis use at age 14 among those with high externalizing at age 11. Based on these previous observations, it was important to account for the influence of both FH and externalizing when determining the extent to which brain activity predicts substance use.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27602, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interestingly, in this sample, neither FH nor externalizing behaviors were significantly different between the initiation and comparison groups when tested is isolation with independent samples t-tests. In addition, neither variable was a significant predictor of substance use initiation. With regard to FH, one explanation for the nonsignificant finding could be due to the manner in which it was measured (i.e., number of parents with a SUD). Future work should consider including second-degree relatives and/or family density scores in the measurement of FH in order to provide a more fine-grained measure of the predictive power of this variable. It is possible that externalizing behaviors did not emerge as significantly different between groups because of reduced variance as a product of participants\u2019 relatively young age as well as the fact that none of them had started using alcohol or drugs at the time of the scan. Finally, as this was a high-risk sample with only 6 FH-participants, externalizing and FH may not have been predictive due to reduced variance in these variables. FH and externalizing behaviors may be predictive of substance use initiation in a healthy, community sample.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28804, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several points are important to keep in mind when interpreting these results in the context of the broader literature on reward anticipation and substance use. Those who initiated substance use in the present study did not reach the threshold for a SUD, indicating that the contrast is between adolescents who try drugs and alcohol at a relatively early age and those who do not. Thus, the differences in brain function are related to substance use initiation rather than something more serious such as dependence. At the same time, adolescents who initiate alcohol use at age 15 have nearly four times the risk for later alcohol dependence compared to those who start at 21 or older. Similarly, the risk for later drug dependence is almost twice as high in those who start using at age 15 relative to those who start at 21 or older. Additionally, over 94% of the initiation group from the present sample reported using more than one substance, indicating a substantially increased risk for problem use later in life. It will be important to continue following these youth into late adolescence and young adulthood in order to track their substance use trajectories as a function of the neurobiological differences observed here. In addition, some limitations should be noted. First, we were not able to investigate sex differences in reward responsivity, owing to the sample being primarily male and to the modest sample size due to the practical constraints of scanning a high-risk sample of substance-na\u00efve youth and following them annually. Second, this sample included children with conduct disorder, ADHD, and anxiety and depressive disorder diagnoses within their lifetime. That is, they display the variations in level of psychopathology that would be anticipated from a community sample whose families are elevated on substance use and related comorbidities (e.g., antisocial behavior, depression). Thus, these results may not generalize to children at different levels of risk, such as samples with higher rates of disruptive behavior disorders (who would be expected to have an even greater risk) and those without any lifetime DSM diagnoses (who would be expected to have a lower risk). Finally, we did not have data on pubertal status, which may be important when the participant age range covers late childhood and early adolescence, as it did here. These issues should be considered in future studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31221, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31233, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate reward anticipation processing in substance-na\u00efve children as a predictor of adolescent substance use initiation. This work is important in order to differentiate the risk factors from the consequences of substance use. Given how malleable the brain is at this age, these results highlight the feasibility and importance of assessing youth quite early and focusing treatment efforts on neurobiological deficits that are directly related to risk before they transition to more problematic use in adulthood. Heightened responsivity to gain anticipation in the NAcc may predispose individuals to early substance use, beyond the risk conveyed by other factors. Despite the difficulty in scanning subjects at a young age and following them over a period of several years in order to characterize their substance use patterns, it will be critical to conduct further studies of this sort.
