Here, we introduce an approach to calculate a spatially fluid chronnectome (called the spatial chronnectome for clarity), which focuses on the variations of networks coupling at the voxel level, and identify a novel set of spatially dynamic features. Results reveal transient spatially fluid interactions between intra-and inter-network relationships in which brain networks transiently merge and separate, emphasizing dynamic segregation and integration. Brain networks also exhibit distinct spatial patterns with unique temporal characteristics, potentially explaining a broad spectrum of inconsistencies in previous studies that assumed static networks. Moreover, we show anticorrelative connections to brain networks are transient as opposed to constant across the entire scan. Preliminary assessments using a multi-site dataset reveal the ability of the approach to obtain new information and nuanced alterations that remain undetected during static analysis. Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) display transient decreases in voxel-wise network coupling within visual and auditory networks, and higher intra-domain coupling variability.

One key finding is a set of replicable large-scale functional brain networks. Brain networks and groups of temporally coherent activity within networks, called functional domains, have been studied and validated using various analytical approaches. Of these approaches, independent component analysis (ICA) enables simultaneous extraction of both the spatial patterns of functional domains and their temporal activity. Studies of brain networks and functional domains demonstrate alterations in their spatial/temporal patterns under different physiological and psychological conditions. However, these studies hold a common assumption that each brain network is comprised of a fixed set of brain regions with a static pattern of activity over time. This is an oversimplification, as the brain is highly dynamic, with variations in associated regions and spatial patterns of brain functional organizations including brain networks. As such, many recent studies have demonstrated the ability of fMRI to capture time-varying brain connectivity. For instance, studying whole-brain dynamic connectivity demonstrates variations in temporal coupling, both within and between functional domains. Examining temporal coupling between brain regions reveals strong correlations between regions known to be part of one network with regions of other networks at particular moments in time. This suggests \u201cisolated\u201d brain networks are only transiently isolated. Additionally, despite recent developments in detecting the dynamic behavior of brain activity using fMRI, spatiotemporal variations of brain networks have been underappreciated. Previous time-varying studies have focused on either 1) dynamic temporal coupling among fixed spatial nodes/networks, which ignore the importance of spatial variations or 2) the dominant spatial pattern at any given timepoint. While these approaches highlight snapshots of spatial patterns at the voxel level, they do not capture the dynamics of spatial variation within and between co-evolving functional networks. Kiviniemi and his colleagues presented work highlighting spatial variation in the default mode network using sliding-window ICA. Other work investigated fluctuation in spatial couplings between spatial components derived from independent vector analysis. While these present intriguing early evidence, to date with the exception of our recent work, there has not been an approach that evaluating the spatial fluidity within and/or between functional brain networks.

Encapsulating transient voxel-wise network coupling allows researchers to capture the spatially fluid behaviors of brain networks. To investigate the spatiotemporal variations of brain networks, we calculate the relationship (via temporal correlation) of each individual brain network with every voxel of the brain. Because the time course of each brain network obtained from ICA represents the network\u2019s temporal activity, its temporal correlation with each brain voxel provides information about the involvement of the voxel with the brain network. Using correlation (rather than multiple regression) allows us to capture the association of each voxel to a given network to a full extent regardless of its contribution to other networks. The spatiotemporal variations of a brain network were encapsulated through measuring the coupling (temporal correlation) between every brain voxel and the given brain network at different moments using a sliding-window approach. Preliminary assessments demonstrate that spatial patterns of brain networks evolve continuously over time and also highlight the ability of the approach to obtain new information of brain function.

The spatial states of large-scale networks can also be related to interdigitated networks previously only observed in single subject analysis. The goal of this study is to introduce the spatial chronnectome and propose several novel spatial dynamic features. We also demonstrate the utility of the spatial chronnectome by evaluating the sensitivity of spatial chronnectome properties to differences between schizophrenia (SZ) patients versus healthy controls.

Furthermore, our approach detected alterations in brain networks that are not identified when a spatially static analysis was performed. Using a variation-based analysis, we demonstrate, for the first time, high coupling variability and different spatiotemporal transition patterns across various brain networks.

K-means clustering was repeated 100 times with different initializations using the k-means++ technique to increase chances of escaping local minima. The correlation distance metric was used to measure the similarity between data points (i.e., the dCMs), as it is more effective in the detection of spatial patterns irrespective of voxel intensities. However, an exploratory analysis using Euclidean distance demonstrated almost identical results. K-means clustering was performed for 3 to 10 clusters, and the spatial maps of the cluster centroids were compared (Supporting Information File S1). For each brain network, the maximum number of clusters that provides distinct spatial maps for centroids were selected by visual inspection for further analysis. Thus, each network includes multiple spatial states as defined by the cluster centroids, and the number of spatial states (centroids) can vary between networks. We also compared our numbers of clusters with the estimated number of clusters using the elbow criterion.

The spatiotemporal transition matrix is constructed by counting the number of voxels transitioning from one bin to another between time windows at a given interval. We calculate this spatiotemporal transition matrix for an interval of one TR, (i.e., by counting the number of transitions between every two consecutive spatial maps), and for larger intervals.

These findings reflect an extension of the classical views of information processing in the brain based on static functional connectivity analyses by providing novel metrics of transient coupling. This approach may have the potential to detect new information about the functional activity of brain regions. For example, the primary visual area, in addition to its role in the visual network, is transiently associated (coupled) with multiple networks which do not typically include visual areas. In our analysis, the primary visual area demonstrates significant positive or negative associations to at least one state of all identified brain networks, suggesting it has a major role in network cross talk. These significant associations may suggest that the primary visual area has significant contribution to brain activities in addition to its role of receiving and delivering visual information from retinal input. There is significant evidence to support the potential role of the primary visual area in other brain functions. While the primary visual area receives most of the retinal input (90%), neuronal tracing and neuronal recording investigations demonstrated feedback connections between the primary visual area and many cortical areas. For instance, the primary visual area receives information from a wide range of sensory and non-sensory cortices such as the primary auditory, parietal, and frontal cortices. Moreover, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interference on the primary visual area introduced impairments to working memory processing. However, the classic view of the primary visual cortex can be well studied by fMRI because fMRI can detect changes associated with higher cognitive function and indirect functional connectivity. fMRI research provides the striking evidence that the primary visual cortex is involved in higher cognitive functions. While our findings are intriguing, it is worth highlighting that they only suggest significant dynamic interplay in temporal coupling measured by the BOLD signal.

Further investigation should evaluate the ability and validity of using the spatial chronnectome to study spatiotemporal variations of brain functional organizations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 62918, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 62941, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 62952, "infons": {"fpage": "663", "lpage": "676", "name_0": "surname:Allen;given-names:EA", "name_1": "surname:Damaraju;given-names:E", "name_2": "surname:Plis;given-names:SM", "name_3": "surname:Erhardt;given-names:EB", "name_4": "surname:Eichele;given-names:T", "name_5": "surname:Calhoun;given-names:VD", "pub-id_pmid": "23146964", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Cereb Cortex", "type": "ref", "volume": "24", "year": "2014"}, "text": "Tracking whole-brain connectivity dynamics in the resting state", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 63016, "infons": {"fpage": "2", "name_0": "surname:Allen;given-names:EA", "name_1": "surname:Erhardt;given-names:EB", "name_10": "surname:Michael;given-names:AM", "name_11": "surname:Caprihan;given-names:A", "name_12": "surname:Turner;given-names:JA", "name_13": "surname:Eichele;given-names:T", "name_14": "surname:Adelsheim;given-names:S", "name_15": "surname:Bryan;given-names:AD", "name_16": "surname:Bustillo;given-names:J", "name_17": "surname:Clark;given-names:VP", "name_18": "surname:Feldstein Ewing;given-names:SW", "name_19": "surname:Filbey;given-names:F", "name_2": "surname:Damaraju;given-names:E", "name_20": "surname:Ford;given-names:CC", "name_21": "surname:Hutchison;given-names:K", "name_22": "surname:Jung;given-names:RE", "name_23": "surname:Kiehl;given-names:KA", "name_24": "surname:Kodituwakku;given-names:P", "name_25": "surname:Komesu;given-names:YM", "name_26": "surname:Mayer;given-names:AR", "name_27": "surname:Pearlson;given-names:GD", "name_28": "surname:Phillips;given-names:JP", "name_29": "surname:Sadek;given-names:JR", "name_3": "surname:Gruner;given-names:W", "name_30": "surname:Stevens;given-names:M", "name_31": "surname:Teuscher;given-names:U", "name_32": "surname:Thoma;given-names:RJ", "name_33": "surname:Calhoun;given-names:VD", "name_4": "surname:Segall;given-names:JM", "name_5": "surname:Silva;given-names:RF", "name_6": "surname:Havlicek;given-names:M", "name_7": "surname:Rachakonda;given-names:S", "name_8": "surname:Fries;given-names:J", "name_9": "surname:Kalyanam;given-names:R", "pub-id_pmid": "21442040", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Front Syst Neurosci", "type": "ref", "volume": "5", "year": "2011"}, "text": "A baseline for the multivariate comparison of resting-state networks", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 63085, "infons": {"fpage": "251", "lpage": "270", "name_0": "surname:Andrews-Hanna;given-names:JR", "pub-id_pmid": "21677128", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Neuroscientist", "type": "ref", "volume": "18", "year": "2012"}, "text": "The brain\u2019s default network and its adaptive role in internal mentation", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 63157, "infons": {"fpage": "550", "lpage": "562", "name_0": "surname:Andrews-Hanna;given-names:JR", "name_1": "surname:Reidler;given-names:JS", "name_2": "surname:Sepulcre;given-names:J", "name_3": "surname:Poulin;given-names:R", "name_4": "surname:Buckner;given-names:RL", "pub-id_pmid": "20188659", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Neuron", "type": "ref", "volume": "65", "year": "2010"}, "text": "Functional-anatomic fractionation of the brain\u2019s default network", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 63222, "infons": {"fpage": "137", "lpage": "165", "name_0": "surname:Arbabshirani;given-names:MR", "name_1": "surname:Plis;given-names:S", "name_2": "surname:Sui;given-names:J", "name_3": "surname:Calhoun;given-names:VD", "pub-id_pmid": "27012503", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Neuroimage", "type": "ref", "volume": "145", "year": "2017"}, "text": "Single subject prediction of brain disorders in neuroimaging: Promises and pitfalls", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 63306, "infons": {"fpage": "1027", "lpage": "1035", "name_0": "surname:Arthur;given-names:D", "name_1": "surname:Vassilvitskii;given-names:S", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "type": "ref", "year": "2007"}, "text": "k-means++: The advantages of careful seeding.

(A) Cartoon of the analysis pipeline. First, spatial independent component analysis (sICA) is applied to obtain brain networks and their associated times courses. ICA consists of several steps including data reduction (principal component analysis), group-level sICA, and subject-level sICA. Following ICA, whole brain dynamic coupling maps (dCMs) of each network for every subject are obtained by calculating windowed-correlation values between the time course of the network and every brain voxel. Finally, time-varying properties of each network are investigated by evaluating spatial variation of dCMs over time and estimating spatial states. Details of the spatiotemporal variation analysis can be found in Sections 2.6 and 2.7. (B) A toy model of calculating the spatiotemporal transition matrix. First, we discretize the correlation value. For visualization purpose, we present three bins here. However, 10 bins were used in the analysis of the real data in which each bin represents a range of correlation value (e.g., 0.2 ~ 0.3). Next, we count the number of transitions from one bin to another between time windows at a given interval. An interval of one refers to evaluating changes between consecutive spatiotemporal transition matrices. An interval of 2 evaluated changes between every two spatiotemporal transition matrices with distance equal to two TRs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 74005, "infons": {"file": "nihms-1017496-f0002.jpg", "id": "F2", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Static group spatial functional connectivity maps of the twelve brain networks obtained from spatial independent components analysis.
