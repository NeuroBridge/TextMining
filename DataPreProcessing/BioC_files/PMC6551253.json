Despite decades of research, a complete understanding of the disease processes remains incomplete, which hinders the development of successful treatments for AUD. One strategy to aid in our knowledge is to study younger individuals with AUD in order to better characterize the brain during the earliest stages of the disorder. Additionally, AUD is a significant health problem in young adults. According to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 12% of individuals aged 21\u2013 25 years old report heavy alcohol use (binge drinking on five or more days in the past month), yet only 5.6% of those 35 and older report heavy alcohol use (NSDUH, 2016). Furthermore, among college aged students (age 18\u201325), studies show that between 10 \u2013 20% meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder; however, in the general population, only around 5% meet the criteria for AUD (, NSDUH, 2016). These epidemiological reports demonstrate that AUD in young adults is already a significant problem. Although a growing body of literature exists on the effects of drinking (and risk for AUD) on adolescent (age 13\u201317) brains (also, see below), little is known about brain structure in young adults (~18\u201325 years old) with AUD. Late adolescence/emerging adulthood is a critical neurodevelopmental window that involves maturation of reward-related regions and cortical areas involved with executive function (for review see). As this age group enters a collegiate environment, the potential for greater exposure to alcohol increases. In turn, this increases the vulnerability for development of AUD and potential concomitant adverse consequences on brain development during this time period. Thus, there is a critical need to better understand the effects of AUD on the brain in younger individuals, as this may ultimately facilitate the ability to identify those at risk for sustained AUD.

The presence of these differences indicates that alterations in WM may not only appear after years of chronic alcohol abuse, but may in fact emerge during the early stages of AUD. The connectomics approach also detected structural connectivity differences in regional and global network connectivity measures in these emerging adulthood AUD subjects, and suggests that DWI studies investigating WM microstructure in AUD populations may benefit from utilizing this complementary, network science-based approaches. The present findings demonstrate WM microstructural structural connectome patterns that may be important for further understanding the early stages of AUD. This is clinically relevant, as young adult AUD represents a crucial time period for intervention to prevent maintenance of AUD throughout adulthood and subsequent potentially damaging changes to brain tissue.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27093, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [],
