The decreased GM volumes of temporal gyrus are implicated for the impairment in sensory integration, storage of language and voice information, and higher-order cognitive functions. Amygdala and hippocampus are critical for memory functions and affect perception. The parahippocampal gyrus is part of the medial temporal lobe, which receives input from heteromodal association areas of the cortex and projects into the limbic circuit for information transmission.

Unlike GM, FC presented significant group difference between FESZ and HC, and a larger impairment in CSZ. We have noticed that there were some literatures in schizophrenia stating that notable GM and FC deficits were revealed in the early stage of the disease. However, in current work, we only observed moderately decreased GM in FESZ, due to the following potential reasons.1) The first-episode patients collected in current study have a relatively short duration of illness (\u2264 2\u202fyears), less than those FESZ reported with DOI\u22645\u202fyears, and previous studies also reported un-significant GMV reduction in the high-risking patients and progressive GMV reductions in schizophrenia patients, supporting our findings. 2) Earlier age of onset of schizophrenia has been reported to be associated with larger regional GM deficits and worse outcome. In this study, the FESZ patients are primarily middle-aged adults (33.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.80\u202fyears old) rather than adolescents, which may infer less GM impairments in the patients compared to other studies. 3) We only focused on the subgroups of the GM and FC data which were simultaneously related with the SNP cluster. For example, lower gray matter volumes in FESZ reported in previous studies were mostly found in the anterior cingulate, insula, caudate and putamen.

Another limitation is that we preselected the risk SNPs based on the PGC's GWAS results rather than Chinese Han GWAS study.
