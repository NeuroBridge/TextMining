Recent evidence suggests that these constructs may be related at the neural level, and together, increase risk for engaging in maladaptive behaviors. The current study examined the degree to which brain function during inhibition relates to brain function during receipt of reward in healthy young adults who have not yet developed problem behaviors. Participants completed the stop signal task to assess inhibitory control and the doors task to assess reactivity to monetary reward (win vs loss) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activation during response inhibition was negatively correlated with brain activation during reward. Specifically, less brain activation in right prefrontal regions during inhibition, including the right inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area, was associated with greater brain activation in left ventral striatum during receipt of monetary reward. Moreover, these associations were stronger in binge drinkers compared to non-binge drinkers.

Problem gamblers and individuals with internet gaming disorder also show heightened activation of reward circuitry when viewing images related to gambling or gaming, respectively, and obese individuals show greater reward response to food cues. Interestingly, there is also evidence that individuals with addictive disorders display a blunted response to non-disorder-related reward, including monetary and sexual reward, and pleasant emotional stimuli.

Although speculative, one potential explanation is that prefrontal functioning could serve a regulatory role in reward processing, similar to its regulatory role in motor inhibition. In the context of motor inhibition, frontal regions are thought to exert \u2018top-down\u2019 executive control over lower level, sub-cortical regions, including the striatum. This frontal-striatal circuitry primarily encompasses dorsal striatal regions involved in motor control, and deficits in prefrontal engagement and weakened frontal-dorsal striatal connectivity are associated with impaired response inhibition. It is possible that such downstream inhibitory projections could extend to ventral striatal regions implicated in reward as well. This idea is consistent with the current findings, as well as reports in both healthy and addicted populations showing that weakened frontal-ventral striatal connectivity during reward processing is associated with greater striatal activation during reward. In order to test whether prefrontal inhibitory functioning does indeed exert top-down regulation over striatal reward regions, future studies should assess reward reactivity following direct manipulations of prefrontal functioning. For example, engagement of inhibitory brain regions can be acutely enhanced using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or pharmacotherapy.

First, this sample was comprised of healthy adults without addictive or impulse control disorders. Without longitudinal follow-up data, we can only speculate about the associations between inhibition and reward as a predictor of addictive behaviors. Second, while our finding that the association is stronger in binge drinkers supports the idea that associations between inhibition and reward may be a prospective marker of risk, this finding also raises the possibility that the association in binge drinkers is a result of heavy alcohol consumption. Again, longitudinal studies are needed to assess associations between inhibition and reward before the onset of any substance use to directly address this question. Third, we probed activation of neural reward circuitry using monetary reward, yet hyperactivation of reward circuitry in addiction is often specific to drug- or disorder-related cues. As such, it is not clear if our findings of responses to monetary reward generalize to responses to drug reward in addiction. Fourth, we did not include a behavioral measure of appetitive motivation, and the behavioral measure of response inhibition (SSRT) did not correlate with brain activity during response inhibition or reward. However, previous studies have also failed to observe robust correlations between SSRT and brain activation, likely due to the need for very large samples and sufficient power for voxelwise analyses. Finally, this study did not include a resting state scan. Future studies are needed that examine associations between inhibitory and reward circuitry when subjects are at rest, to determine whether these networks are coupled in the absence of any task manipulation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28090, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In sum, this is the first study to show that individual differences in prefrontal engagement during response inhibition are related to individual differences in engagement of reward circuitry during receipt of monetary reward. These findings have important implications for understanding risk for impulsive and addictive behaviors, particularly in individuals with compromised inhibitory functioning. It will be important for future longitudinal studies to examine interactions between inhibitory and reward functioning as prospective predictors of the onset and escalation of these disorders later in life.
