Identification of alcoholism-related neurofunctional power dynamics using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that relate to cognition and behavior may serve as biomarkers of alcoholism. Previously, resting-state fMRI studies examined BOLD signals at a single low-frequency (LF) bandwidth. BOLD signals, however, oscillate systematically at different frequencies and are organized in a resting brain where LF oscillation facilitates long-distance communication between regions across cortical regions, whereas high-frequency (HF) oscillation occurs in closely localized, subcortical areas. Using a frequency power quantification approach, we investigated whether the organization of BOLD signal oscillations across all measured frequency bandwidths is altered in alcoholism and relates to cognitive performance. Frequency-dependent oscillation power differences between 56 sober alcoholics and 56 healthy controls occurred for all frequency bands. Alcoholics exhibited greater frequency oscillation power in the orbitofrontal cortex and less power in the posterior insula within the HF bandwidth than controls. Aberrant orbitofrontal HF power was associated with poorer memory performance and slower psychomotor speed in alcoholics. Middle-frequency and LF power proved sensitive in detecting altered frequency oscillation dynamics in parietal and postcentral cortical regions of alcoholics. This study is novel in identifying alcohol-related differences in BOLD oscillation power of the full fMRI frequency bandwidth. Specifically, HF power aberrations were associated with poorer cognitive functioning in alcoholism and may serve as a biomarker for identifying neural targets for repair.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1998, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "INTRODUCTION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2011, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Chronic excessive alcohol consumption is known to affect neurophysiological and cognitive functions that contribute to self-awareness, attention, memory, reward and control over addictive behavior.

Some fMRI studies have shown aberrations of orbitofrontal BOLD signals in alcoholics, who exhibited greater orbitofrontal cortex activation than controls in response to alcohol-related stimuli, a pattern that correlated with higher subjective alcohol craving, suggesting that hyperactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex can contribute to increased reward expectancy and addictive behaviors. Aberration in orbitofrontal neurofunctional dynamics in the HF band could affect inter-regional communication. For example, we recently showed that alcoholics had greater functional connectivity than controls between inferior prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex (BA11/47) and anterior cingulate cortex, a hub in the salience network, shaping the interaction of rewardassociated behaviors with incentive salience in alcoholics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26030, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Notably, greater orbitofrontal HF power in alcoholics was associated with poorer verbal memory, logical memory and graphomotor abilities. Although the role of the orbitofrontal cortex is not directly associated with these abilities, HF power predominant regions such as hippocampus and striatum, which are functionally connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, do play important roles in memory, learning and motor function. Overall, the increased orbitofrontal oscillation power in the alcoholic brain might index a shift in its frequency power distribution and serve as a neural marker for a greater engagement of reward system nodes at the expense of perceptual-motor and memory processing efficiency.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26732, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another brain region that plays an integrator role between subcortical limbic-striatal and cortical regions is the insular cortex. We observed aberrant frequency power of the posterior insula in the alcoholic brain in the HF band, which is sensitive in detecting subcortical regional oscillation power. The link between insula and alcoholism has been widely demonstrated: the insula has various roles in alcohol-related cue processing, reward-related decision making, craving, conscious awareness and interoception. Further, the posterior insula, functionally connected to sensorimotor cortex, is responsible for relaying primary motor and sensory information to the sensorimotor cortex and the anterior insula. Recently, demonstrated that people with substance use disorders including alcoholics had attenuated posterior insula activation in response to sensory stimulation. This finding is consistent with attenuated perfusion of the insula detected with arterial spin labeling in alcoholics. The observed diagnosis-specific difference in HF oscillation power of the posterior insula adds to previous results and emphasizes the functional role of this region in alcoholism. Altered frequency oscillation power in brain regions that link subcortico-cortical circuits may reflect aberrations in intrinsic neuronal rhythmicity and affect how information is converged from cortical and subcortical areas.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28135, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Group differences for MF and LF oscillation power were observed in posterior brain regions where alcoholics exhibited greater left postcentral and occipito-temporal ALFF power and less right parietal ALFF power than controls. Studying resting-state default mode network relative to active task-engaged networking in alcoholism, previously observed stronger connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the postcentral cortex during a spatial working memory task in alcoholics relative to controls. Similarly, found greater posterior cingulate cortex connectivity to postcentral and temporal regions in sober alcoholics than controls while viewing alcohol-related video sequences stimulating cue-induced cravings. Even during simple motor tasks, alcoholics were found to recruit additional postcentral and temporal regions in contrast to controls. Thus, alcoholics in these studies exhibited similar task-activated posterior regional activation patterns not seen in controls. In our study, however, spontaneous fluctuations of the BOLD response were observed during rest and not in response to a task. Accordingly, the identified group differences may essentially describe a shift in the regional BOLD frequency power spectrum in chronic alcoholics with potential consequences for abnormal inter-regional synchronization when tasks engage posterior brain networks, e.g., when comparing incoming visual stimuli with experiences. Finally, we observed less LF oscillation power in the parietal cortex including the supramarginal gyrus in alcoholics than in controls. Compromise of parietal regions in alcoholism has been previously associated with impairments of working memory, visuospatial and attentional abilities. These findings lead to the speculation that BOLD frequency power dynamics depend on the relative role a region plays within cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical networks and that the pattern of intrinsic regional frequency power aberration may be indicative of altered neurobiological mechanisms in alcoholism.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30176, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Gray matter volume deficits occur in chronic alcoholism and can be a confounding factor for rs-fMRI functional connectivity and taskevoked BOLD signal analysis.
