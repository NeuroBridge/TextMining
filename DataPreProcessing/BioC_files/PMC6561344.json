Supporting the relative independence of the reported cannabis clusters from covariates, when we reran our voxelwise analysis using SES, EXT, and alcohol usage group as the primary variables, minimal overlap (23 total voxels) was observed between clusters defined by cannabis use and those defined by SES, EXT, and alcohol usage group (Supplement).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21229, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Brain-Behavior Analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21254, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "At baseline, greater activation in the lateral occipital cortex was associated with higher WM accuracy (\u03b2 = .340, tr = 3.39, p = .012 corrected) (Table 4).

Accordingly, our data suggest a possible specific association between cannabis use risk and limitations in visuospatial cognition.

To this end, our results showing increased activation in frontoparietal regions before cannabis use in adolescence are inconsistent with our previous research showing that early cannabis onset is associated with decreased frontoparietal activation in adulthood. In light of normative neurodevelopmental decreases in frontoparietal engagement [; see for review], differences in frontoparietal regions associated with substance use risk may involve an interaction between stable trait-level differences and developmental processes. Given that the groups were significantly different on many neurocognitive measures while covarying SES and externalizing symptoms, this neurodevelopmental risk may be relatively distinct from demographic factors.
