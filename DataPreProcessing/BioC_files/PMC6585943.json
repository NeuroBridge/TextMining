For example, the rates of smoking are almost two-fold greater in those with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) relative to psychiatrically healthy individuals. In fact, the risk for smoking and earlier initiation of nicotine use is associated with ADHD symptoms, even when these symptoms are below the threshold for clinical diagnosis. Links between ADHD symptoms and nicotine dependence raise the possibility of shared neurobiological underpinnings between the disorders. One potential area of linkage may be disruptions of the salience network (SN), which is anchored by the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral anterior insula (AI). Generally, the SN is thought to integrate internal and extrapersonal information to guide behavior, which is relevant in nicotine dependence, given the influence of salient internal (subjective feelings of craving, withdrawal) and external stimuli (smoking-related cues) on the motivation to smoke. The SN\u2019s role in focusing attention and guiding behavior also fits with the hallmark symptoms of ADHD including inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (NIMH, 2017).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3205, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Salience network involvement in both disorders is supported by a wealth of information linking the primary nodes of this network with both ADHD and nicotine dependence. Specifically, the dACC strongly contributes to the pathophysiology of ADHD (for review see:). Those with ADHD also have greater insula reactivity during affective processing and show insula and dACC hypo-activity during inhibitory tasks. Insula function also plays a key role in nicotine use in human (Dias et al., 2006), and rodent models (; Pushparaj et al., 2013), while dACC function and neurochemistry has been linked to difficulty ignoring smoking cues. In terms of functional connectivity, ADHD and smoking withdrawal impacts the resource allocation index (RAI), which is a measure of SN-centered interactions with the executive control and default mode networks (ECN, DMN). Specifically, relative to healthy adolescents, those with ADHD show reduced RAI scores and decreased SN-ECN connectivity, suggesting that reduced communication between the SN and networks such as the ECN may contribute to ADHD. Evaluating SN relationships with both the ECN and DMN by evaluating RAI is critical given evidence that the SN facilitates switching between ECN and DMN dominated states allowing for effective cognition. Connectivity within the SN, between the dACC and dorsal anterior insula, also plays a role in nicotine dependence, as connectivity strength between these regions is associated with reactivity to smoking cues and severity of nicotine dependence.

Somewhat surprisingly, there were no group differences in RAI score, which is a measure of SN interactions with the DMN and ECN, indicating that inter-network interactions did not differ based on smoking status. This lack of difference may be due to nicotine dependent individuals being allowed to smoke prior to scanning (~1\u20131.5 prior), as others reported that RAI is higher in sated vs. overnight abstinent smokers, suggesting that nicotine abstinence may reveal additional group differences. In relation to dACC-AI coupling, our prior work showed that coupling strength in smokers was not influenced by exposure to smoking cues or following an hour delay since smoking, suggesting that dACC-AI strength is stable during early abstinence. The idea that acute changes in nicotine do not influence intra-SN connectivity is supported by who showed no change in intra-SN coupling strength following nicotine administration. Whether dACC-AI connectivity changes over longer-term abstinence is still unclear.

It is likely that the low level of ADHD symptoms in the non-smokers diminished the ability to see an association in this group alone, and assessing non-smokers with more pronounced ADHD symptoms may reveal a significant correlation in nonsmokers as well. Thus, it is plausible that dACC-AI coupling may be associated with ADHD symptoms more broadly and not only in those who smoke. However, this hypothesis is speculative and requires further testing.

This hypothesis fits with claim that the ACC plays a specific role in \u201cattention for action\u201d as well as the idea that the dACC and AI are involved in attentional direction and salience processing. These processes are disrupted by damage to either SN node as stroke damaging the insula reduces motivation and drive, including the motivation to smoke and cingulotomy patients note impairments in the initiation of behavior and formation of intentions (Cohen et al., 1999).

Relative to healthy adolescents, those with ADHD show reduced RAI scores and decreased SN-ECN connectivity. One hypotheses suggests that individuals with ADHD have an immature SN which may contribute to both a lack of proper task preparation and over-activation of the SN resulting in impulsivity, which is a common trait noted in those with a substance abuse disorder. Further, adults with ADHD have been found to have enhanced SN connectivity with other brain regions such as the putamen, which the author interprets as contributing to enhanced sensitivity to external stimuli. This theory fits with the idea that individuals with ADHD are more susceptible to interfering irrelevant stimuli. In relation to nicotine dependence, interference from external, irrelevant smoking stimuli predicts relapse vulnerability. Such behavioral interference is associated with the function and neurochemistry of the SN nodes and individuals with stronger dACC-AI connectivity at rest show greater brain reactivity to smoking cues. Collectively this suggests that greater dACC-AI connectivity may influence neurocognitive properties leading to enhanced interference and behavioral reactivity to external stimuli contributing to both ADHD and nicotine dependence. This conjecture is supported by recent work showing that moment-to-moment changes in arousal is associated with changes in SN connectivity. Specifically, inter-SN connectivity linearly increases with arousal, while SN-ECN connectivity shows an inverted-U shape pattern of connectivity, peaking at moderate arousal levels before dropping off at higher levels of arousal. While arousal was not measured directly in this study, it is plausible that the group differences and association with ADHD scores may map to differences in response to arousing stimuli.

Prior reports have shown a weak negative association between dACC-AI coupling and number of cigarettes smoked over the past 60 days. However, the association we report in the current work (r = \u22120.28) was not statistically different (z = 0.32, p = 0.75) from the value reported by (r = \u2212 0.21, p < 0.05) who reported a significant association due to their larger sample size (N =144). Nevertheless, the similar correlation values between studies suggests dACC-AI coupling may contribute in a small way to the variance in cigarettes smoked per day. It is possible that more posterior regions of the ACC and insula play a stronger role in this aspect of smoking behavior, as weaker connectivity between more caudal regions of the ACC and posterior insula is associated with nicotine addiction severity. In line with this, poorer cessation outcome has been associated with weaker posterior insula connectivity to primary somatosensory regions. Nicotine dependence severity also has been associated with weaker coupling between the dACC-dorsal striatum. The dorsal striatal activation reported by Hong did show slight overlap with the ventral posterior region of the insula, mirroring findings reported by Moran above. Collectively, these studies suggest that weaker dACC communication with regions beyond the dorsal anterior sub region of the insula studied here may be associated with dependence severity. The strong involvement of the currently studied dACC and insula regions is supported by the vast findings that these regions co-activate during smoking cue-exposure across studies and during cue-exposure the insula shows enhanced connectivity with brain circuits involved in motivated behavior.
