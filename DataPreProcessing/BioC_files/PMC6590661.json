However the effects of multiple GHB\u2010induced comas and regular GHB\u2010use on intrinsic brain connectivity during rest remain unknown.

Its capacity to induce euphoria, sociability, sexual arousal (in low doses), but also relaxation and altered states of consciousness (in higher doses), are accountable for its use as a recreational drug (Bosch et al., 2018; European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), 2016; Korf et al., 2014; Liechti et al., 2016). Despite the modest prevalence of GHB\u2010use in the population, GHB overdose with GHB\u2010induced coma is still the fourth most common drug\u2010related cause for emergency attendances in Europe (EMCDDA, 2016; Liakoni, Walther, Nickel, & Liechti, 2016; Mir\u00f3 et al., 2017; United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2017). The high risk of intoxication appears largely related to the narrow dose\u2013response window between the desired effect and overdose with severe side effects, such as seizures, amnesia, or transient GHB\u2010induced coma (Korf et al., 2014; Mir\u00f3 et al., 2017; Van Amsterdam, Brunt, McMaster, & Niesink, 2012). GHB\u2010induced coma is, in fact, a hallmark of regular exposure to high doses of GHB, lasting between 1 to 4 hr and often reaching the highest classification on the Glasgow coma scale (Korf et al., 2014; Mir\u00f3 et al., 2017). Remarkably, no immediate side effects are experienced after regaining full consciousness from these comas, which leads regular GHB\u2010users to have on average a staggering number of \u226550 GHB\u2010induced comas (Korf et al., 2014; Raposo Pereira et al., 2018a).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3156, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently we showed that GHB\u2010exposure, or more specifically the effect of multiple GHB\u2010induced comas, were associated with alterations in different neurocognitive domains related to memory processing and prefrontal cortex function (Raposo Pereira et al., 2018a, 2018b). These studies show that multiple GHB\u2010induced comas are associated with differences in neural activity of the hippocampus, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the temporal visual association areas (Raposo Pereira et al., 2018a, 2018b). In addition, these studies showed an association between multiple GHB\u2010induced comas and altered functional connectivity (FC) between the DLPFC and regions of the salience network (SN), as well as differences in FC between the hippocampus and temporoparietal regions of the default mode network (DMN) and the central executive network (CEN; Raposo Pereira et al., 2018a, 2018b). These studies assessing long\u2010term memory and working memory function have provided valuable information on regular GHB\u2010use related differences in human brain function under cognitive demanding conditions.

The anti\u2010correlation between CEN and DMN connectivity is considered a key mechanism for the optimal balance between internal thought and goal\u2010directed cognitive performance (Andrews\u2010Hanna, Smallwood, & Spreng, 2014; Christoff et al., 2009; Laureys, Perrin, & Br\u00e9dart, 2007).

Other GABAergic sedative compounds like propofol, sevoflurane, and midazolam have been shown to influence resting\u2010state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the CEN, the DMN, and the SN. This is however not exclusively related to these compounds since sleep induction without pharmacological agents is known to produce similar effects (De Havas, Parimal, Soon, & Chee, 2012; Hudetz & Mashour, 2016; Liang et al., 2015; S\u00e4mann et al., 2011; Stamatakis, Adapa, Absalom, & Menon, 2010a; Uhrig, Dehaene, & Jarraya, 2014). Contrary to normal rest, there is decreased intrinsic connectivity of the DMN and decreased anti\u2010correlation between the CEN and the DMN during sedation and hypnotic states, and this is associated with a diminished capacity to integrate sensory stimuli (De Havas et al., 2012; Hudetz & Mashour, 2016; Liang et al., 2015; Stamatakis, Adapa, Absalom, & Menon, 2010b; Uhrig et al., 2014).

To test our hypotheses, we performed the following planned comparisons: GHB\u2010Coma versus GHB\u2010NoComa/No\u2010GHB (effect of multiple GHB\u2010induced comas) and GHB\u2010NoComa versus No\u2010GHB (effect of GHB\u2010use per se). The randomize tool from FSL with 10,000 permutations and family\u2010wise\u2010error (FWE; p\u2009<\u20090.05) correction using the threshold\u2010free cluster enhancement followed by Bonferroni correction across networks were used (Smith & Nichols, 2009). Covariates of no\u2010interest were introduced to control for premorbid\u2010verbal IQ, exposure to recreational drugs other than GHB (cocaine, stimulants other than cocaine, ecstasy, and sedatives), and GM volume (IQ and GM introduced as linear variables; exposure to the referenced drugs as five dummy variables) (Oakes et al., 2007).

Rest is usually associated with a state of mind\u2010wandering, described as a state of ongoing self\u2010related thought of which individuals are unaware, during which attention is directed away from external stimuli (Christoff et al., 2009; Hasenkamp et al., 2012; Mooneyham et al., 2017). During this process rsFC of the DMN tends to increase while rsFC of the CEN decreases (Christoff et al., 2009; Fox et al., 2015). This anti\u2010correlation is regarded as beneficial for cognition by allowing attention to be either directed toward self\u2010related thought or goal\u2010directed behavior (Christoff et al., 2009; Jilka et al., 2014; Laureys et al., 2007; Raichle, 2015). In our study, the GHB\u2010NoComa group showed even lower negative connectivity between the DMN and the R\u2010CEN when compared with the No\u2010GHB group. This suggests that the GHB\u2010NoComa group may require a stronger anti\u2010correlation between these networks in order to reach the same state of rest and mind\u2010wandering as the No\u2010GHB group. The participants in our study were not under the influence of GHB during the investigation. Interestingly, in studies assessing the acute effects of GHB, no alterations are observed in rsFC between the DMN and the CEN (Bosch et al., 2017, 2018). This difference is most likely related to whether or not participants were intoxicated, but may also be partly explained by differences in the subjects that were investigated.

The ACC is particularly involved in conflict detection and is highly connected with frontal regions of the CEN, which together form an important executive control pathway (Bosch et al., 2018; Cocchi, Zalesky, Fornito, & Mattingley, 2013; McVay & Kane, 2010). At rest, the ACC is involved in conflict monitoring between awareness of external stimuli or self\u2010related thought, and increases its connectivity with the CEN in order to control these ongoing shifts in the focus of attention (Christoff et al., 2009; Cocchi et al., 2013; Hasenkamp et al., 2012; McVay & Kane, 2010; Mooneyham et al., 2017). Our results of lower rsFC within the R\u2010CEN with a region in the dorsal ACC may reflect reduced capacity to monitor information conveyed by the CEN, thereby reducing the capacity of the CEN to initiate the resolution of conflict between external stimuli and the desired state of mind\u2010wandering during rest (Christoff et al., 2009; Cocchi et al., 2013).

These results suggest that multiple GHB\u2010induced comas have no additional effect on GHB\u2010use related alterations in intrinsic connectivity. A possible explanation may be the different experimental conditions under which the data were obtained: during task performance versus in rest (Raposo Pereira et al., 2018a, 2018b). In our previous experiments, participants were performing highly demanding cognitive and emotional tasks that recruited frontal, limbic and parietal regions (Raposo Pereira et al., 2018a, 2018b).

However, the study also has some limitations. Only male participants were included, which means that we cannot generalize our findings to female GHB\u2010users. However, the vast majority of GHB\u2010users are males (Mir\u00f3 et al., 2017). Likewise, regular GHB\u2010users are generally polydrug users. For that reason, we decided that inclusion of polydrug users as a control group would more realistically represent this population.

We therefore controlled the analyses for exposure to recreational drugs other than GHB that differed significantly between the groups.
