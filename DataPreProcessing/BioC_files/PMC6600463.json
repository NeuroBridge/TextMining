First, [11C]NNC112 has a significantly higher affinity for the D1R. Second, for both radioligands 5-HT2A receptor binding contributes to a nonnegligible fraction of cortical binding, and differences in this fraction might cause systematic differences.

We conclude that this effect may be regional since it was not observed for the STR, where the data were most consistent with the null hypothesis. The difference between patients and controls in the DLPFC was 12.5%, which can be viewed in relation to the recently demonstrated test-retest repeatability of about 9.5% for this tracer in the DLPFC measured using the same PET system and methodology.

In the only previous study finding lower levels in drug-naive patients, binding potential was obtained using microparameters from 2TCM with plasma as input function. However, this method has shown low reliability for quantification of [11C]SCH23390 binding due at least in part to the rapid metabolism of this tracer. In the present largest sample of drug-naive patients hitherto reported in PET studies of D1R in psychosis, our analysis showed that the data were over 50 times more likely to have occurred under the decrease hypothesis model than they were under the increase hypothesis model (Table 2). It should be noted, however, that a meta-analysis of the results of the studies would likely result in no overall significant difference in frontal D1R due to the heterogeneity of the results, as well as the limited number of patients. In total there have only been 67 patients (42 drug naive) examined with [11C]SCH23390 and 47 patients (19 drug naive) examined with [11C]NNC112.

For D1R, ex vivo studies in rodents have shown no effect on [11C]SCH23390 binding by amphetamine-induced dopamine release or dopamine depletion, whereas other studies found a paradoxical decrease of [11C]SCH23390 binding in response to dopamine depletion. Moreover, PET studies employing amphetamine-induced release and reserpine-induced depletion of dopamine in NHPs have not shown any effect on the D1R Bmax or KD. Similarly, the D1 radiotracers [11C]NNC756 and [11C]SKF82957 have been reported to be insensitive to amphetamine challenge in NHP and a study in humans did not show any effect on [11C]SCH23390 binding after DA depletion after a-methylparatyrosine.

Studies in NHPs have demonstrated a 5HT2A contribution to both [11C]SCH23390 and [11C]NNC112 binding in cortex of approximately one-quarter of the binding, the latter of which has been replicated in human studies. In addition, some studies suggest that 5-HT2A receptor availability may be lower in schizophrenia patients compared with controls (, 2016) although other centers have reported no significant differences. However, the magnitude of the current difference (12.5%) suggests that, if the present findings were to be entirely accounted for by differences in the availability of 5-HT2A receptors, they would correspond to a 50% reduction, which is clearly larger than the reported values. Hence, the presently observed decrease in DLPFC D1R can likely not be fully explained by a decrease in 5HT2A receptors. Similarly, SCH23390, like all currently available pharmacological agents, does not distinguish between D1R and D5R. However, the distribution of the D5 mRNA is rare and discrete with little overlap with the distribution pattern of the D1 mRNA. Hence, the signal attributable to the D5R in the DLPFC is unlikely to account for the present results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37436, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "If a reduction in frontal D1R density in psychosis can be confirmed, this could have implications for interpreting other clinical findings in studies of schizophrenia. Reduced frontal blood flow has been linked to negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Subsequent functional MRI studies have demonstrated reduced frontal activity and executive performance. Brozoski et al. showed in NHPs that dopamine in the PFC is essential for working memory functions and that depletion of dopamine from the DLPFC was as detrimental to cognition as removing the cortex itself. Similarly, Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic reported working memory deficits by specifically blocking D1R in the PFC. Interestingly, recent findings of blunted frontal dopamine release by amphetamine and by cognitive tasks in patients suggest that lower frontal dopamine transmission could be an underlying neurochemical mechanism for the observed hypofrontality. It can thus be speculated that reduced D1R density is either a contributing factor or a consequence of such a pathophysiological process.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38500, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "All antipsychotic drugs are antagonists at the D2R subtype. However, occupancy at the D1R has also been reported in patients treated with some antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine. The selective D1R antagonist SCH39166 has been tested as monotherapy in 3 open clinical trials in acutely ill psychotic patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis; however, there was no improvement in positive symptoms in any of the 3 studies and only a few patients improved negative symptoms. Neither was a placebo effect observed as is commonly seen in open trials and with acutely hospitalized patients. On the contrary, several patients deteriorated and were withdrawn prematurely. Assuming that patients do indeed have low frontal D1R density as we found in the present study, it is tempting to suggest that the lack of placebo effects and worsening of the symptoms after D1 antagonism may have been caused by lowering the dopamine D1 transmission even further with a D1R antagonist, and that instead, a D1R agonist may have beneficial effects. Preclinical studies show an inverted-U dose response to D1R agonists such that there is an optimal level of D1R mediated dopamine activity on cognitive behavior. Hence, the present finding of 12.5% reduced frontal D1R may be sufficient to induce cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. Thus, in patients with reduced D1R a D1R stimulation could improve cognitive function whereas D1R antagonism may worsen symptoms. Indeed, reversal of antipsychotic induced working memory deficits has been demonstrated in NHPs by the D1 agonist ABT 431. However, an initial clinical trial failed to demonstrate improved cognition in patients with schizophrenia by the full selective D1R agonist DAR-0100A, which may have been due to low dosing and consequently also low D1R occupancy. Recently, a combined haloperidol and levodopa administration, to achieve high selective D1R agonist effect, improved working memory-related brain activation in humans. Improved D1R agonists that achieve higher levels of D1R occupancy are needed to test the efficacy of this putative mechanism for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40657, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, 17 healthy controls and 18 neuroleptic na\u00efve patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis each underwent one PET measurement with the D1R radioligand [11C]CH23390.
