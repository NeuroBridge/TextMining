To understand how opioid use modulates the neural response to reward/value in chronic pain, we compared brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to a monetary incentive delay (MID) task in patients with fibromyalgia taking opioids (N\u2009=\u200917), patients with fibromyalgia not taking opioids (N\u2009=\u200917), and healthy controls (N\u2009=\u200915). Both groups of patients with fibromyalgia taking and not taking opioids had similar levels of pain, psychological measures, and clinical symptoms. Neural responses in the nucleus accumbens to anticipated reward and non-loss outcomes did not differ from healthy controls in either fibromyalgia group. However, neural responses in the medial prefrontal cortex differed, such that patients with fibromyalgia not taking opioids demonstrated significantly altered responses to anticipated rewards and non-loss outcomes compared to healthy controls, but patients with fibromyalgia taking opioids did not. Despite limitations including the use of additional non-opioid medications by fibromyalgia patients taking opioids, these preliminary findings suggest relatively \u201cnormalized\u201d neural responses to monetary incentives in chronic pain patients who take opioids versus those who do not.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1384, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1397, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Exogenous opioids are potent analgesics that exert their effects at the level of the spinal cord and by involving supraspinal sites via descending circuits (for review). However, evidence suggests that long-term opioid use may not clinically improve the condition of individuals with chronic pain. Current guidelines do not recommend opioids for the treatment of fibromyalgia, a condition of widespread chronic pain, due to the overlap between side effects of opioids (e.g., negative impacts on mood, sleep, cognition) and many co-occurring symptoms of fibromyalgia (e.g., impaired cognition, anxiety, depression, fatigue, poor sleep quality) as well as the potential for addictive behaviors when taking opioids. Other than a small number of studies investigating efficacy of tramadol, there are no randomized controlled trials of pure mu-opioid agonists on fibromyalgia. However, despite opioid treatment not proving superior to non-opioid treatment for chronic pain, some individuals with chronic pain report benefitting over 12 months when taking opioids, similar to their non-opioid taking counterparts. Further, recent data from opioid taper clinical trials indicate that approximately 25% of patients with chronic pain taking opioids choose not to participate in opioid tapering (and almost another 25% withdraw), suggesting that these individuals may believe they are benefiting from opioids despite myriad known side-effects. This discrepancy between clinical observations and patients\u2019 beliefs is not trivial given significant and increasing concerns regarding the risks of opioid use, including overdose and addiction. Prescription of opioids for the treatment of fibromyalgia, in particular, remains controversial and poorly informed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3143, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While the use of long-term opioid medications might not be beneficial for chronic pain per se (i.e., in terms of not improving physical function and not reducing pain interference for example), it is possible that opioid medications could be benefiting brain reward processing and associated reward behavior in patients with chronic pain. Endogenous opioids are heavily involved in neural circuits implicated in reward processing. Neural circuits implicated in reward processing include a network of cortical and subcortical regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) within the ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ventral tegmental area (VTA), amygdala, insular cortex, thalamus, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Exogenous opioids can modulate reward-related behavior in animals (i.e., enhance drug reinforcement/place preference), and endogenous opioids partially mediate stress-induced analgesia in humans. To date, a fair amount of published data exists on reward processing and effects of opioids on brain reward circuits in animal models of chronic pain. In sharp contrast, limited data currently exist on how use of exogenous opioids influence reward processing in humans with chronic pain. It has been shown that individuals taking opioids (without chronic pain) have reduced functional connectivity (correlated activity) between the NAcc and other reward-related regions including the medial inferior orbitofrontal cortex. Additionally, in individuals with chronic low back pain, rapid structural changes occur in brain regions involved in pain and reward processing (including the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) after only one month of opioid therapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4832, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The study of reward and punishment is highly relevant for chronic pain. One of the most common features of someone in chronic pain, including fibromyalgia, is the development of fear-avoidance to movement, or kinesophobia. This phenomenon is a great barrier to treating patients and helping improve their physical function and quality of life. Physical activity leads to pain (a punishment), which in turn progressively diminishes physical activity frequency, while avoidance of movement (and pain) is rewarding in the short-term which reinforces this maladaptive cycle. Thus, it is important to understand the mediators, moderators, and mechanisms of reward and punishment to develop and optimize safe and effective treatments to reduce or break this cycle. Chronic pain can alter neural function implicated in incentive processing, for example via reduced neurotransmission in motivational circuits in rodent models of chronic pain and as evidenced by reduced NAcc response to painful stimulus offset in chronic pain patients. Further, individuals with chronic pain may have reduced brain opioid and dopamine function. Moreover, we have shown in a previous publication that individuals with fibromyalgia have reduced arousal to monetary incentive cues, reduced responses in the MPFC during reward anticipation, and increased MPFC response to non-loss outcomes (or avoidance of punishment).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6224, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Neural responses to rewards can be influenced by the experience of chronic pain, use of exogenous opioids, and potential for addictive behavior associated with opioid use - and all of these factors likely interact in complex ways.

The MID task manipulates potential monetary incentives involving gains (e.g., +$5 versus $0) and losses (e.g., \u2212$5 versus $0) and yields measures of brain activity in response to both anticipation and outcome phases of these experiences across repeated trials. In healthy individuals participating in the MID task, reward anticipation typically elicits robust increases in bilateral NAcc activity, which correlates with ratings of positive aroused affect. This response is often accompanied by increased activity in the insular cortex (associated with risk), as well as other regions including the caudate and thalamus. Conversely, reward outcomes typically elicit increased activity within regions of the MPFC, along with the caudate, amygdala and putamen, indicating that anticipation and outcome represent distinct components of reward processing. In our previous publication, fibromyalgia patients not taking opioids show normal NAcc reward anticipatory activity, but reduced MPFC reward anticipatory activity, and increased MPFC response to non-loss outcomes (non-punishment), as compared with healthy controls. In the present study, we compared a new cohort of fibromyalgia patients taking opioids to the previously published data set. While the effects of long-term opioid use on reward processing in chronic pain patients are generally unknown, we developed our current predictions based on these prior results. We specifically predicted that NAcc and MPFC responses to anticipated rewards and non-loss outcomes might be similarly altered in individuals with fibromyalgia taking opioids, as compared with healthy controls, and that this pattern would occur to a greater extent than in patients with fibromyalgia not taking opioids.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8584, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Results", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8592, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Participants", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8605, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "Participant Demographics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8631, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table", "xml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th/><th>Controls</th><th>Non-Opioid</th><th>Opioid</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total Participants (all female)</td><td>15</td><td>17</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Righthanded</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">\n<bold>Self-Identified Race</bold>\n</td></tr><tr><td>Asian</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>African American</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Caucasian</td><td>8</td><td>13</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Hispanic or Latina Ethnicity</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">\n<bold>Employment Status</bold>\n</td></tr><tr><td>Part-time employed</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Full-time employed</td><td>10</td><td>6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Unemployed</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">\n<bold>Income Level</bold>\n</td></tr><tr><td>$0-$29,999</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>$30,000-$59,999</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>$60,000 or more</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\">\n<bold>Education Level</bold>\n</td></tr><tr><td>High School</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>College/University</td><td>7</td><td>11</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Advanced Degree</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table>\n"}, "text": "\tControls\tNon-Opioid\tOpioid\t \tTotal Participants (all female)\t15\t17\t17\t \tRighthanded\t14\t16\t17\t \tSelf-Identified Race\t \tAsian\t6\t2\t0\t \tAfrican American\t0\t0\t1\t \tCaucasian\t8\t13\t14\t \tOther\t1\t2\t2\t \tHispanic or Latina Ethnicity\t1\t3\t2\t \tEmployment Status\t \tPart-time employed\t2\t3\t2\t \tFull-time employed\t10\t6\t2\t \tUnemployed\t3\t8\t13\t \tIncome Level\t \t$0-$29,999\t0\t5\t7\t \t$30,000-$59,999\t2\t3\t5\t \t$60,000 or more\t11\t8\t4\t \tEducation Level\t \tHigh School\t0\t3\t0\t \tCollege/University\t7\t11\t11\t \tAdvanced Degree\t8\t3\t6\t \t", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9130, "infons": {"file": "Tab1.xml", "id": "Tab1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_foot"}, "text": "\u201cNon-opioid\u201d and \u201cOpioid\u201d refer to the non-opioid fibromyalgia group and opioid fibromyalgia group respectively.
