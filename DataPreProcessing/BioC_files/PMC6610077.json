We examined how demands associated with changes in attentional requirements in a Sustained Attention Task (SAT) may contribute to differences in functional involvement of the PFC and relation to clinical status. A group of 24 individuals with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls (N\u2009=\u200940) performed the SAT and a visuospatial condition (vSAT) while activity in the bilateral anterior PFC was monitored using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results confirm that the right frontopolar region plays a role in control of attention for both patients and healthy controls. However, patients with schizophrenia exhibited a general attentional deficit and inefficient right-medial PFC activation. Additionally, we observed a strong regional association between left Middle Frontal Gyrus (MFG) activity during the vSAT task and the PANSS score driven by the negative symptom subscale.

Attention deficits are among the key cognitive impairments associated with the illness and are a driving factor in quality of life and other functional outcomes. These symptoms typically predate psychosis and may act as a stable indicator of schizophrenia vulnerability but are largely unresponsive to pharmaceutical intervention with traditional or atypical neuroleptics. Without any appropriate avenue for remediation, attention impairment represents a fundamental cognitive symptom that is unaddressed by currently available clinical therapies.

In particular, dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is commonly observed as diminished activation, termed \u201chypofrontality\u201d. However, both insufficient activation (decreased) and excessive activation (increased) in the PFC have been reported in patients, suggesting that rather than an explicit failure of function, irregular involvement of the PFC may reflect dysregulation in the processes of attention itself. Evidence from cued target tasks and saccadic responses indicate that the bottom-up maintenance of processes is relatively intact within schizophrenia, while in the presence of unpredictable cues and stimuli, the top-down processes are impaired. As a result, it has been proposed that people with schizophrenia may be particularly impaired during the \u201cControl of Attention\u201d, a top-down process through which information is restricted to relevant stimuli and appropriate attentional biases are developed including selection of an appropriate attentional \u2018zoom\u2019. Attentional biases towards task-relevant information are theorized to occur through the coordination of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms according to the biased competition model of selective attention.

In the first stage, attention is fairly evenly distributed over the central field of a view to allow for parallel processing of an area. Whereas in the second stage, attention becomes focused on a specific area, leading to improved focal awareness at the expense of more distributed stimuli. Thus, there exists a tradeoff between processing efficiency and the size of the area being attended according to the level of \u2018zoom\u2019 that is engaged during a task. In schizophrenia, an\u00a0inefficient ability to define or maintain appropriate attentional distribution may lead to a state of \u201chyperfocusing\u201d which may reduce the visual span or saccadic length, and even contribute to failures in spatial working memory.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5202, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A recent Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) imaging study using the Sustained Attention Task (SAT) identified a role for the right-PFC (BA 9/10) in healthy subjects when task difficulty was modulated by the presence of a distractor and it was later proposed that dysfunction in this region may be the cause of observed behavioral deficits in patients with schizophrenia. The right-PFC region has previously been ascribed a substantial role in initiation and maintenance of attentional processes as well as attentional dysfunction associated with fatigue and distraction. In schizophrenia, studies of attentional processes have noted the specific involvement of the right-PFC as an important regional hub and observed failures in attention have been as ascribed to a \u201cfrontal inefficiency\u201d stemming from diminished connectivity between the executive network guided by the dlPFC and a salience network driven by the anterior insula.

This finding would point to a relative dysregulation in schizophrenia as a failure to efficiently deactivate the right-medial SFG in a manner which increases Task Performance in an area known to be associated with sustained attention. The anterior PFC, approximating Brodmann\u2019s Area 10, has been frequently associated with both with the control of attention and more broadly with other higher order executive functions including decision making, working memory, problem-solving, and mentalizing responses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31545, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We observed a role in the right-medial SFG for performance sensitivity as measured by the relative decrease in SAT-score induced by the vSAT condition (Score Difference). We observed that right-PFC activity was differentially modified in response to increased demands with larger relative performance decreases associated with an increase in right-medial SFG activation. One possible interpretation for this is this additional activation is related to the increased difficulty of maintaining a broader area of attention or a wider attentional \u2018zoom\u2019. In a continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) study conducted by Demeter et.al., the authors observed right-MFG involvement in the sensitivity of performance to a distraction condition using a variation of the SAT in healthy subjects. Therefore, this increased activity could point to an increase in required attentional effort in response to task demands, despite an inability to maintain performance relative to initial task conditions. The presence of these similar trends again seems to identify this region as sensitive to attentional demands whether due to the presence of a distractor or spatial variability. The absence of an interaction of group for performance sensitivity as well as for brain activity in the presence of significant baseline performance deficits suggests that other factors may contribute to the observed performance deficits in schizophrenia. One possibility is that the right-PFC was unable to recruit connected regions (such as parietal regions and insula) as has been previously proposed or other regions not accessible to the sensor used in this study. Another possibility is that the vSAT was too easy to elicit a clinically differential response and other modifications may be necessary to capture this aspect. In one recent study investigating the presence of \u201chyperfocusing\u201d in schizophrenia, Kriether et al. identified that compared to healthy controls, individuals with schizophrenia were unable to properly filter sensory responses to inner vs outer stimuli in a Useful Field of View Task (UFOV). In this work, we observed a tendency towards a performance sensitivity amongst patients between targets which occupied the center position which appeared to support this hypothesis, however, due to the relative rarity of center position targets, the results were inconclusive.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33909, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "When we examined the interaction of task type and clinical status, we noted significant relations between activity of the left-MFG and clinical status as identified by the Total-PANSS. These relations appeared to be specific to task-related activity associated with the vSAT, with minimal differences observed in the SAT task. When exploring the clinical subscales that contribute to the Total-PANSS score, we saw that this relationship was driven by the PANSS-General and PANSS-Negative subscales with minimal contribution from the PANSS-Positive scale. Several optodes in this region expressed rather strong negative correlations with decreased activity being associated with higher Negative symptom scores. Significant negative correlations in the Left-PFC with PANSS negative symptoms have been previously reported in executive tasks such as the Tower of London and Trail-Making-Test B. In the vSAT task, this trend was especially strong in Optode 5 for [HbO] (rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.75, p\u2009=\u20090.0001). This region is relatively close to the target of TMS-related therapies for schizophrenia, which currently is among the only treatment methodologies purporting to ameliorate negative symptoms, although studies report varying efficacy in this matter. Despite this, we observe that mean values in Healthy Controls in this region did not significantly vary from the patient group.

Early fNIRS studies argued that individuals with schizophrenia had altered asymmetry in executive and attention tasks, and the reduction of hemispheric connectivity has been repeatedly observed in more recent both structural and functional connectivity studies. This attenuated asymmetry has been related to increased presence of clinical symptoms and proposed to be a trait of schizophrenia. Impairments in the right -MFG may more directly influence cognitive control as observed in this task. In patients with severe negative symptoms, failure of activation in the left-MFG may occur as a result of reduced connectivity and reduce the ability of patients to compensate as has been observed when the right-MFG is damaged.

First, all patients in the study were medicated and it is possible that the effects of varied prescribed antipsychotics may have contributed to the results observed in the study. Although preliminary analysis indicated that patient performance was not sensitive CPZ equivalent dosage, antipsychotic medication has commonly been reported to have limited effect on cognitive measures including cognitive control and attention. Second, the block -level analysis method used in this study may have overlooked interesting features which could have provided more information regarding visuospatial deficiencies in schizophrenia. Future researchers may wish to use systems capable of higher sampling frequencies to investigate event-related responses within trials of the SAT and vSAT. It has been proposed that higher sampling frequencies may increase the speed of fNIRS response detection and other more rapid imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) may offer additional insight into the visuospatial dysfunction observed here. Third, the fNIRS system used in the study did not allow regions outside the anterior prefrontal cortex to be monitored. It is possible that other brain areas such as parietal cortex might provide additional information. Lastly, schizophrenia is also accompanied by visual processing deficits in a variety of modalities which contribute to higher level dysfunctions in a variety of downstream domains. Performance differences frequently attributed to failures of attention and other top-down processes may be conflated with dysfunction in the visual processing system. The magnocellular pathway is critical for the rapid detection of low-contrast and stimuli with low spatial frequency. When working together with the slower parvocellular pathway, the two integrate to form a complete visual representation. In this \u201cfill and frame model\u201d visual, the magnocellular pathway identifies broad visual descriptions while the parvocellular pathways provide the details.

Although we note that performing this experiment using a display arrangement that is capable of targeting peripheral vision (>30\u2009deg) may be an interesting avenue of research.

The results confirm that the right frontopolar region plays a role in control of attention for both patients and healthy controls. However, patients with schizophrenia exhibited a general attentional deficit and inefficient right-medial PFC activation. Finally, we observed a strong regional association between the left-MFG activity during the vSAT task and the PANSS score driven by the negative symptom subscale.
