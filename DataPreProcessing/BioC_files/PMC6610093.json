Despite these advantages, MST has been rarely used to study network abnormalities in schizophrenia. An MST graph mapping a network structure is its simplification, therefore, it is important to verify whether the reconfigured network is significantly related to the behavioural dimensions of the clinical picture of schizophrenia. 35 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 35 matched healthy controls underwent an assessment of information processing speed, cognitive inter-trial variability modelled with ex-Gaussian distributional analysis of reaction times and resting-state EEG recordings to obtain frequency-specific functional connectivity matrices from which MST graphs were computed. The patients\u2019 network had a more random structure and star-like arrangement with overloaded hubs positioned more posteriorly than it was in the case of the control group. Deficient processing speed in the group of patients was predicted by increased maximal betweenness centrality in beta and gamma bands, while decreased consistency in cognitive processing was predicted by the betweenness centrality of posterior nodes in the gamma band, together with duration of illness. The betweenness centrality of posterior nodes in the gamma band was also significantly correlated with positive psychotic symptoms in the clinical group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1649, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1662, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Schizophrenia is a progressive disease characterized by complex psychopathology and cognitive dysfunctions impeding the abilities of independent living. A significant part of modern studies concerning the neural underpinnings of the disorder are focused on recognizing the patterns of aberrant brain integration. It resulted from the assumption that schizophrenia (SZ) might be understood as a pathological state of disconnection within the neural system. The disconnection or neural miswiring refers to a pathology in the coordination of brain elements from the level of cellular signalling to aberrant axonal connections between various neuroanatomical structures. Much of the evidence for desynchronized neural activity in SZ comes from research using resting-state functional magnetic resonance methods (r-s fMRI), aimed at finding enhanced or reduced functional connectivity between numerous brain areas and networks. Functional connectivity (FC) might be defined as the statistical association between spatially distributed neurophysiological time series. Despite a substantial increase in the scope of knowledge regarding abnormal FC in SZ individuals, an infinite number of possible connections between different brain regions makes it difficult to assess the condition of the network in a global dimension. To circumvent this problem, a graph theorem has been implemented to evaluate the complex whole-brain functional and structural networks. Moreover, implementation of graph theory makes possible\u00a0the transition from investigating associations between a given number of structures to interpreting overall connectivity configuration.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3307, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous studies of neural networks organization in schizophrenia confirmed various types of pathologies, however, a substantial inconsistency of detailed results has been noted. The inconsistency was mainly due to the application of various solutions regarding networks and connectivity metrics and dissimilar modalities of neuroimaging technics. Kambeitz with co-workers conducted a meta-analysis of the whole-brain network architecture to verify whether the integrity of brain functioning is globally disrupted in schizophrenia. The authors selected eight fMRI and five EEG studies. In general, the results based on three r-s fMRI studies of SZ samples showed significant decrease of the small-worldness, a metric indicative of appropriate balance between local segregation and global integration of the network. What is more, patients also had a significantly reduced clustering coefficient, showing the extent of regional density or a tendency toward the development of cliquishness within the network, and diminished local efficiency indexing the fault tolerance of the network. Two r-s EEG studies demonstrated non-significant decrease in minimal path-length, a measure associated with integration of the network. Another r-s EEG study also confirmed the decreased clustering coefficient in the SZ group. Analytical results showed reduced local organization of the patients\u2019 network, but also marked that the main limitation of the included research concerned arbitrariness in setting a threshold for connectivity strength, which could be a major reason for the heterogeneity of the results. It is also worth noting that Kambeitz et al. were able to find only two r-s EEG studies which significantly differentiated the global network\u2019s organization of SZ patients and controls.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5092, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Apart from the assessment of the overall neural activity arrangement, the research also concerned the evaluation of networks at the regional level, in order to identify neural circuits differentiating SZ patients and controls in functional connectivity strength. Alamian and co-workers have attempted to indicate results typical for patients across various neuroimaging modalities (MEG, EEG, fMRI), and suggested that FC within the frontal cortex can be assumed as definitively altered in SZ, regardless of the neuroimaging method used. For example, Zhu et al. showed that SZ patients exhibited increased nodal centrality in central and posterior regions and decreased centrality in anterior and subcortical structures compared with controls. Additionally, almost all graph theory-driven research in SZ refers to the number and the location of the so called central hubs. Hubs are highly connected nodes, characterized by strategic connectivity facilitating the integration of the network. In healthy individuals, central hubs have been located mainly, though not exclusively, within the anterior areas including the prefrontal cortex and, according to Rubinov and Bullmore, various abnormalities regarding the anterior hubs, with fewer hubs located in the frontal cortex and the emergence of more non-frontal hubs, are typical features of SZ patients\u2019 networks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6455, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Compared to various types of imaging methods based on magnetic resonance, electro- and magnetoencephalography (MEG) enables the identification of altered oscillatory synchronization occurring in millisecond-range resolution, grasped in several frequencies, including the fastest ones, e.g. above 30\u2009Hz, which are beyond the temporal range for methods based on MRI.

MST enables the reconstruction of an acyclic, loop-less subgraph of the original undirected, weighted graph in which all nodes are connected. The output of the MST analysis contains only a subset of the strongest connections representing a stable network\u2019s core and allows an unbiased comparison of networks differing in its density (Fig.\u00a01). To date, many studies have been carried out using MST to reconstruct the global neural networks in such clinical conditions as, for example, epilepsy, stuttering, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in brain maturation research. These studies confirmed the usefulness of the MST algorithms to identify network irregularities in the mentioned populations. Moreover, van Diessen with co-workers proved that MST metrics differentiated epileptic patients better from controls in terms of their network\u2019s organization than the conventional graph-theory indicators. As it was demonstrated in the study of Engels et al., MST might be also applied to regional analysis of the network, by establishing the betweenness centrality (BC, a measure of the hub-status) for each node (EEG electrodes) and then averaging BC results for nodes assigned to anterior, central and posterior regions.

Jonak with co-workers conducted an r-s EEG study to contrast MST-derived networks indices in first-episode and multi-episode SZ patients.

In addition, to our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted to verify whether the expected abnormalities in SZ patients\u2019 EEG-derived networks, measured by MST, are significant predictors of cognitive deficits and psychopathological symptoms typical for schizophrenia. This is of special importance, considering that although MST provides well-defined subnetworks, yet, to some extent generates only a simplified model of the original network, without connections forming loops.

Because cognitive speed in SZ patients is related to white matter integrity and strength of long-range synchronization, we assumed that its disruption should be associated with global network properties, such as centrality or assortativity. Secondly, much of the research carried out so far has confirmed universally heightened cognitive variability in SZ subjects and their healthy siblings. According to fundamental ideas of Fox and Raichle regarding the nature of resting-state brain dynamics, behavioural inter-trial variability is considered as the genuine manifestation of spontaneous fluctuations within the intrinsic, distributed cortical systems. Therefore, we postulate that the network abnormalities examined in the off-task condition should also be associated with increased cognitive variability in SZ.

Schoen et al. noticed that heightened connection entropy in gamma band correlated with a pathologically high PANNS outcome collected before starting the antipsychotic treatment, but after treatment and having achieved a significant clinical improvement, these correlations were no longer statistically significant. Considering the mentioned results, Schoen with co-workers suggested that abnormal connectivity formation in patients is correlated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but not with symptomatology changing in response to pharmacological treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31915, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to the analysis of irregularities in the organization of neural networks in schizophrenia, we also demonstrated that the overall poor score in the cognitive speed test in SZ group was predicted by two unrelated variables: the increased average response times (RTs) and processing variability in a form of the most elongated RTs. The elongated average RTs were predicted by increased BCmax in beta and gamma bands, together with the duration of untreated psychosis. The positive correlations between BCmax in higher frequencies and the most typical patients\u2019 RTs mean that the response time extended with increasing centralization of the strongest nodes in the network. A topological organization of a network not secured against the overload of the central hubs suffers from a serious imbalance between integration and selection in information processing. It seems, therefore, that the inefficient selectivity in networks performance might limit the ability of fast cognitive performance. The ex-Gaussian indicator of cognitive variability covering the most elongated RTs (\u03c4), which explained even a larger scope of cognitive speed variance than the average RTs, was predicted by betweenness centrality of posterior nodes in gamma band and the duration of illness in the SZ sample. As marked earlier, schizophrenia is associated with a greater density of highly centralized nodes in the posterior area of the cerebral cortex. The backward-shifting of hubs proved to be a significant predictor of the increasing inconsistency during the cognitive speed task in the SZ group. Associations between failures of attentional-executive control over processing speed task and more posteriorly located hubs in our SZ group might be interpreted with reference to the previous findings confirming that the strength of anti-correlation between the \u2018task-negative\u2019 (e.g. default-mode network) and \u2018task-positive\u2019 networks, explained a significant part of cognitive instability variation in healthy participants. Fassbander et al. also found that reduced activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia was accompanied by very long RTs during the Stroop task. This effect was interpreted as an evidence of insufficient recruitment of cognitive control networks during trials with prolonged RTs. It should be noted however that the comparison of the groups included in our study did not show that SZ patients had statistically significant lower betweenness centrality across the anterior/frontal area.

Secondly, fluctuations in cognitive processing and neural activity were not induced by changes of the task requirements.

The yielded results seem to confirm the validity of the applied methodology since in the present study the specific neural networks\u2019 features in the SZ group explained a substantial range of variance in cognitive\u00a0performance. Thirdly, to determine the organization of the neural activity, resting-state EEG was used, with a relatively small amount of electrodes, what could have restricted the precision of nodes location.

The task of the participant is to match numbers to abstract symbols as fast as possible. The idea to develop an original computerized version of the test in a form of a tablet application resulted from the necessity to provide access to all the raw data containing temporal parameters of task performance (in milliseconds).

The data were band-pass filtered from 0.5 to 70\u2009Hz and, with an active notch filter, set at 50\u2009Hz. After having been recorded, the data were exported to ASCII format. For further analysis, the ASCII files were imported to EEGLAB v.13.5.4b1, an open source toolbox for MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.). Then, each EEG recording was offline filtered with a bandpass Hamming window 0.5\u201345\u2009Hz filter, and re-referenced offline to the common average reference. The common average reference was calculated with the exclusion of Fp1/2 and A1/2 electrodes because of contamination by EMG artifacts, electrodes A1/2 were excluded from further analysis. The data were then segmented into 75 epochs with the duration of 4096 samples (approximately 8\u2009s) each. All of the epochs were visually inspected by a certified clinical neurophysiologist who removed from the analysis epochs contained by artifacts, such as head or muscle movements, jaw clinching and electrode cable movements. Finally, for each participant, thirty artifacts free epochs of 4096 samples were selected. As the number of the selected epochs across participants should be equal, and to avoid excluding additional subjects from the analysis, due to the number of artifacts in the recordings, we chose the number of 30 artifacts free epochs as the safe value for further analysis. In the next step, the epochs were band-pass filtered into the frequencies: delta (0.5\u20134\u2009Hz), theta (4\u20138\u2009Hz), lower alpha (8\u201310\u2009Hz), upper alpha (10\u201312\u2009Hz), beta (13\u201330\u2009Hz) and low gamma (30\u201348\u2009Hz).

These steps are performed as many times as possible and at the end, the final tree contains 19 nodes and 18 edges, considering the number of all electrodes used in our EEG recording. The MST metrics were calculated based on all PLI matrix, in every frequency band, separately. The MST enables computation of many parameters, however, they are strongly correlated and, therefore, redundant. The limitation of the number of MST metrics included in statistical analysis was also guided by an attempt to avoid type 1 error. According to van Diessen et al. (2016), MST diameter and leaf number or leaf fraction, are two most straightforward global metrics informative of the MST network topology. Moreover, they are sufficient to classify the networks as more line-like, in which case the diameter increases and the leaf number decreases, or star-like, with high leaf number and low diameter. A degree parameter is defined as the number of links connected to a node, calculated for each node separately. In this study a maximal degree value was computed to characterize the degree of the whole tree. A leaf fraction refers to the number of nodes on the tree with degree\u2009=\u20091, it can be defined as Lf\u2009=\u2009L/m, where L is the leaf number. The leaf number ranges from 2 (typical of a line-like topology) and a maximum value m\u2009=\u2009N-1 (a star-like topology). The leaf number is associated with the tree diameter (d), defined as the largest distance between any two nodes. The upper limit of the diameter is defined as dmax\u2009=\u2009m-L\u2009+\u20092, so, the largest possible diameter decreases when the leaf number increases. To compare the groups with regard to network hub measure, the betweenness centrality (BC) was also computed, defined as the number of the shortest paths between any pair of nodes i and j in the network passing through  node u, divided by the total number of paths between i and j. BC values range from 0 for the leaf node and 1 for the central node in a star-like network where it has the highest load.

In this case, all between-group comparisons performed with controlled covariates were carried out individually for each dependent cognitive variable. The Bonferroni correction was applied to establish statistical significance threshold resulting from multiple testing of controlled covariates. After determining the distributional parameters significantly differentiating the groups, correlations between these parameters were calculated separately for SZ and HC groups to verify the potential dependencies between ex-Gaussian indicators. The next step was to perform regression analysis with the overall result in the DST test as a dependent variable and ex-Gaussian parameters, which differed the groups as independent variables to determine which of them could account for cognitive slowdown in the SZ group. In the SZ group, associations between the mentioned ex-Gaussian parameters and clinical variables were also identified with application of two-tailed Spearman correlation (R). Next, raw PLI and MST results averaged across the epochs per subject were log-transformed [y\u2009=\u2009ln(x)] to ensure distributional normality of these variables.

Similarly as in the case of cognitive variables comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was used to set a statistical significance threshold. After establishing the functional connectivity and network indicators differentiating the studied groups, they were correlated with the ex-Gaussian parameters being significant predictors of cognitive speed in the SZ sample. In this case, the Pearson\u2019s r correlation coefficient was applied. To control for the hypothetical impact of clinical independent variables on cognitive\u2013network relationships in the SZ group, a multivariate regression analysis was performed with ex-Gaussian parameters as dependent variables and MST results as independent variables, including the duration of illness, duration of untreated psychosis, and the risperidone equivalent as controlled predictors. Only the variables which significantly differentiated the studied groups and uncorrelated predictors were included. Additionally, the potential correlations between MST parameters and psychopathology assessed with the PANSS scale were verified. Due to the fact that the PANSS results deviated from the normal distribution, the two-tailed Spearman R coefficient was used.
