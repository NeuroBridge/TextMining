Although previous rTMS treatment studies have demonstrated that rTMS to the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and the VMPFC can reduce subjective craving, the neural reactivity to drug cues may provide an even more robust and objective marker of relapse risk. This cue reactivity is of particular importance in the development of treatment for addiction because it has been shown to predict relapse in cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, and opioid users. These studies have demonstrated that cue-related reactivity in frontostriatolimbic circuitry is a transdiagnostic endophenotype of relapse vulnerability. Hence, neurobiological treatment approaches targeting the neural circuitry related to cue reactivity, such as cTBS to the VMPFC, may provide a direct influence on subsequent cue-induced craving and relapse. Furthermore, neural biomarkers serve as objective and quantifiable measures for evaluating changes associated with treatment beyond what can be gathered from self-report or behavior alone.

To target drug/alcohol cue reactivity, we employed a drug cue induction paradigm during TMS sessions as part of the treatment. This enabled us to \u201cmobilize\u201d or prime the circuit before modulation. The use of cues to amplify the neural response to TMS was first demonstrated by Dinur-Klein et al.. In their large, parametric study, they demonstrated that rTMS delivered in the presence of a smoking cue produced significantly larger reductions in cigarette use and craving than rTMS delivered without a cue prime. Although the mechanisms through which this priming-associated plasticity occurs are not fully understood, preclinical and clinical research supports the notion that changes in excitability induced by brain stimulation are state dependent, or depend on the history of activation. For instance, Muellbacher et al. found that inhibitory rTMS applied directly after motor learning inhibited the expression and maintenance of long-term potentiation in the primary motor cortex. In contrast, a study by Rioult-Pedotti et al. found that inhibitory rTMS given before motor learning produced facilitation in the primary motor cortex. These and other studies suggest that there is an interaction between the neural state and stimulation protocol that is of crucial importance to determining the magnitude and direction of the aftereffects.

In other words, individuals with shorter-term cocaine dependence, lower baseline subjective craving, and lower trait anxiety experience more of a treatment-related attenuation in cue-evoked FC. Therefore, it is possible that individuals with mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms may respond best to the TMS treatment.

Specifically, these experiments were designed to gather data on the basic proof of principle that cTBS to the VMPFC could induce specific decreases in drug/alcohol cue reactivity when rigorously compared with a sham condition in a single-blinded manner. While several clinical parameters were associated with greater efficacy on FC, we did not observe an effect of cTBS on drug/alcohol-induced craving. While craving is endorsed as a key feature of SUDs (as noted by its inclusion in the DSM-5), in human behavioral experiments it is an outcome measure that is often highly variable and as such does not in itself indicate lack of potential clinical utility. Given this, the data relevant to a larger clinical trial (including the durability of clinical effects, if they exist) is still unknown. For these same reasons, it is not yet clear if cTBS-related changes in drug/alcohol cue reactivity correspond to real-world changes in drug/alcohol intake. Although there are some studies in nicotine and cocaine users that have shown changes in use patterns following excitatory DLPFC TMS, a considerable amount of work needs to be done in this area. For instance, although the duration of neural effects of 3600 pulses of cTBS has not yet been assessed in an imaging study, Chistyakov et al. found that in medication-stabilized depressed patients, 10 sessions of 3600 pulses cTBS to the right DLPFC resulted in a significantly greater reduction of Hamilton depression scores as compared with sham cTBS. Therefore, 3600 pulses of cTBS likely produces long-term depression\u2013like effects on neural circuitry, and the corresponding behavioral effects of cTBS last beyond the time of stimulation. To further address these unknowns, our group is presently conducting the first double-blind, active sham\u2013controlled clinical trial of TMS in treatment-engaged cocaine users, which involves cTBS to the VMPFC over the course of 10 days.

Studies showing TMS effects on craving in SUDs have also involved multiple treatment sessions. This suggests that the effects of TMS on complex behaviors such as craving are likely cumulative. Therefore, while we do not show changes in craving after a single session, it is possible that after a multisession VMPFC cTBS intervention the effects on self-reported craving may emerge\u2014a possibility that will be addressed by our lab\u2019s ongoing multisession clinical trial in cocaine users.

All participants received both real and sham cTBS. (A) For cocaine users, a three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (treatment [real/sham] \u00d7 time [pre/post] \u00d7 region of interest [ROI]) revealed a significant interaction between treatment and time (F1,768 = 27.1, p < .00001), but no main effect or interaction with ROI, indicating a general effect of treatment \u00d7 time across all frontostriatal and frontolimbic ROIs.
