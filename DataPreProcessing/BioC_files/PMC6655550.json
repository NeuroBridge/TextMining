In other words, repetition suppression is observed when a second stimulus shares features to which a neuron responds selectively with a preceding stimulus. The fMRI response to a repeated stimulus is thought to arise from repeated activation of a set of neurons, resulting in a reduced fMRI response. By contrast, two alternating stimuli that share few features should engage relatively nonoverlapping sets of neurons, resulting in a stronger fMRI response overall. Accordingly, fMRI adaption has been widely used to characterize the stimulus selectivity of neuronal populations in humans. The stimulus selectivity of neurons corresponds to the property of neural tuning, which refers to the selective responsivity of neurons to certain stimulus features. Aberrant neural tuning has recently been proposed as a potential mechanism underlying cognitive and perceptual abnormalities in severe psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), but empirical evaluation of this possibility has been sparse.

For example, neurons in early visual cortex (EVC) are tuned for orientation such that neurons preferentially respond to stimuli with a certain orientation. Similarly, neurons in lateral occipital complex (LOC) are tuned for objects such that neurons respond preferentially to a certain visual object over others. fMRI adaptation has been widely used to examine stimulus selectivity in areas such as these, both in humans and nonhuman primates. For example, fMRI responses to repeated presentations of an object are reduced compared to different objects in LOC, supporting the view that neurons in LOC are tuned for individual objects. While fMRI adaptation is commonly observed for repeated stimuli, some studies have found the opposite pattern--enhanced fMRI responses to repeated stimuli.

The stimulus selectivity of neuronal populations (i.e., neural tuning) is closely associated with NMDA and GABA systems, both of which are key features of prominent pathophysiological theories of SZ. Abnormal NMDA and GABA neurotransmission has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of BD. Thus, our finding of abnormal stimulus selectivity for objects raises an intriguing possibility that reduced stimulus selectivity may link to specific neuropharmacological systems implicated in the pathophysiology of both disorders. This could have important consequences for the development of interventions targeting those systems.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26923, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given that this stimulus selectivity is considered a fundamental feature of neuronal processes responsible for information processing in the brain, one may wonder why this study failed to find an association between aberrant fMRI adaptation and cognitive function. It is possible that this relationship may not have been apparent in our data because we used MCCB to assess working memory and verbal memory. It is possible that abnormal object tuning might influence certain cognitive abilities that are related to specific stimuli. For example, several studies have shown that the magnitude of fMRI adaptation was related to subsequent memory of stimuli that were used to probe fMRI adaptation, though it remains to be determined whether this relationship is specific to implicit memory or explicit memory or exist for both types of memory.

In this way, it resembles auditory sensory gating (e.g., P50) or mismatch negativity paradigms that have been well-studied in SZ and BD. Previous studies have shown reduced sensory gating or mismatch negativity in both SZ and BD. fMRI adaptation, similar to auditory sensory gating and mismatch negativity, is associated with the way that neural systems handle repeated information in the environment.
