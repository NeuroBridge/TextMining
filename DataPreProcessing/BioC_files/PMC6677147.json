The capacity to suppress automatic responses in favor of goal-relevant but non-habitual actions is considered to be an essential aspect of cognitive control. Extensive evidence suggests that it is subserved by a predominantly frontal cortical network with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a central node in this interactive network. While the abundant anatomical connectivity between the ACC and lateral frontal cortices is well-described, the functional characteristics of communication between these regions during cognitive control, response selection and execution, are poorly understood.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3842, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The highly influential Conflict Monitoring theory proposes that cognitive control arises from a dynamic interaction between the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices. This account purports that the ACC monitors for conflict between competing representations and engages the lateral prefrontal cortex (latPFC) to implement response control and optimize performance. However, this account is primarily based on the functional MRI (fMRI) studies using the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. The fMRI-BOLD signal is an excellent spatial mapping tool but its temporal resolution is limited because it reflects regional hemodynamic changes mediated by neurovascular coupling. As a result, the BOLD signal changes unfold on a much slower time scale (in seconds) than the underlying neural events (in msec). Moreover, the BOLD signal is sensitive to alcohol\u2019s vasoactive effects and may not accurately represent the magnitude of neural changes, which makes it less suitable for studies of acute alcohol intoxication. Therefore, the presumed interplay between the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices and its sensitivity to alcohol intoxication need to be examined by methods that record neural events in a temporally precise manner. MEG has an excellent temporal resolution since it directly reflects postsynaptic currents. The anatomically-constrained MEG (aMEG) methodology employed here is a multimodal approach that combines distributed source modeling of the MEG signal with structural MRI. It allows for the estimation of where the conflict- and beverage-related brain oscillatory changes are occurring and to understand the temporal sequence (\u201cwhen\u201d) of the involved neural components.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5544, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Decision making relies on interactions of distributed brain regions that are dynamically engaged to deal with increased demands on cognitive control. One way to estimate event-related changes in long-range synchrony between two cortical regions is to calculate their phase coupling as an index of their co-oscillations. The present study applied a phase-locking analysis to test the basic tenet of the Conflict Monitoring theory by examining the co-oscillatory interactions between the ACC and latPFC. Neural oscillations in theta range (4\u20137 Hz) are associated with cognitive control and have been proposed as a fundamental mechanism supporting the long-range synchronization needed for top-down cognitive processing.

To better understand the timing, degree, and nature of the interactions between these two principally engaged cortical areas, the PLV was calculated for each beverage and task condition, and for each participant. As shown in a group average in Figure 7, co-oscillations between the ACC and latPFC vary across time with an overall early increase in co-oscillations during a stimulus processing stage. Under placebo, this is followed by a sustained increase after ~400ms on incongruous trials during the integration and response preparation stage. Thus, synchronized co-oscillations between the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices are observed only on the more difficult, incongruous trials evoking response conflict F(1,19) = 5.5, p < .05. This evidence supports the proposal that the ACC and the latPFC functionally interact in real time to subserve cognitive control. In contrast, acute alcohol intoxication significantly dysregulates the co-oscillations, yielding a Condition x Beverage interaction, F(1,19) = 5.1, p < .05 in which incongruous trials specifically were affected by alcohol F(1,19) = 8.8, p < .01 (Figure 7).

The aMEG approach combines the strengths of these techniques to provide insight into the spatio-temporal stages of oscillatory dynamics and the long-range integration subserving cognitive control. This method provides greater temporal precision than other neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI-BOLD whose temporal resolution is on the magnitude of seconds due to its indirect sensitivity to neural changes via neurovascular coupling. In comparison, the millisecond precision of MEG signal allows for the investigation of neural processing stages, as demonstrated by the present study. The aMEG model assumes distributed sources of the MEG signal along the cortical surface which, when reconstructed from structural MRI images, provides spatial constraints for activity estimates. These spatial estimates can be used to investigate not only local activation but long-range communication at an interactive network level in the form of phase-locking. Moreover, the aMEG approach is well suited for investigating the effects of pharmacological manipulation on neural functions given that the fMRI-BOLD signal is confounded by the vasoactive effects of pharmacological manipulations such as alcohol and may not accurately reflect the magnitude of neural changes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23784, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The high sensitivity of this method to minute neural changes means that it is also sensitive to non-neural noise including muscle movements or eye blinks so the various artifacts need to be detected and carefully removed from the raw signal.

As shown in Figure 5, theta power is differentially sensitive to cognitive demands imposed by the Stroop task conditions. Incongruity is especially effective in engaging cognitive control as reflected in greater theta power in the prefrontal cortex compared to prestimulus baseline. The principal estimated generator of theta oscillations is the ACC which is sensitive to response conflict during both, early and late processing stages. These findings support the role of the ACC in monitoring for conflict in concordance with prominent accounts. Thus, the aMEG method has provided a temporally-sensitive insight into the sustained engagement of the ACC during trials imposing higher load on cognitive control. Together with extensive anatomical connections between the ACC and distributed brain regions, this evidence corroborates its multifaceted role in self-regulation. On that view, the ACC is a key hub in the neurofunctional system that subserves cognitive control by aligning goals and intentions with contextual and motivational constraints. Inferolateral prefrontal cortex, especially on the right, is another important area within that system which has been associated with inhibition of prepotent responses, attentional control, and working memory in the service of updating task representations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25854, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It has been established that theta oscillations mediate neural integration necessary for cognitive and affective processing. Neural communication may thus rely on synchronized excitability of distant neuronal ensembles in theta band with nested fast rhythms mediating local processing. PLVs reflect phase consistency between cortical areas and are commonly used to estimate their oscillatory synchrony as it is assumed that two areas interact when they co-oscillate. Indeed, transient increases in PLV are observed in those intervals of neural activity that would be expected to necessitate synchronous interactions. The present study confirms previous evidence and adds spatio-temporal refinement to the functional synchronization between the sources estimated to the ACC and the latPFC. Consistent with previous reports, the present results indicate that PLVs are increased and sustained on incongruous trials in the Stroop task. By quantifying phase synchronization between these two areas with high temporal precision, these findings extend the Conflict Monitoring account and indicate that their interaction is particularly prominent after ~350ms on incongruous trials. During this cognitive integration stage, the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices are likely to interact to support behavioral performance during more difficult task conditions imposing demands on attention, response inhibition, and working memory. Extensive evidence from MRI-based functional connectivity studies indicates that these cortical areas form a dynamic, interactive cingulo-opercular network that supports top-down cognitive control. More broadly, the brain optimizes responding to environmental demands in an adaptive and coherent manner via flexible and dynamic synchronization of distributed neurofunctional systems.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27664, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The anatomically-constrained MEG approach used in the present study relies on a combination of complementary imaging methods.

The MEG signal reflects synaptic currents directly which allows for testing hypotheses about co-oscillatory interactions within and across neurofunctional systems with high temporal precision. Furthermore, this method is suitable for pharmacological manipulations because it is not susceptible to vasoactive confounds. Research from this lab and others indicates that prefrontally-mediated cognitive control functions are particularly vulnerable to alcohol intoxication. The present study shows that acute alcohol intoxication decreases activity in the prefrontal areas subserving response conflict. Furthermore, alcohol disrupts synchronized co-oscillations which may underlie impaired or maladaptive response suppression. As a result, intoxicated individuals exhibit deficient self-control resulting in disinhibition which may contribute to compulsive drinking and the development of alcohol dependence. In sum, estimates of synchronous co-oscillations can illuminate real-time interactions of the neural systems engaged by a particular cognitive demand and can inform a realistic brain-based model.
