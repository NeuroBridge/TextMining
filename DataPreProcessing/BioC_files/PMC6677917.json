Commonly measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to characterize the intrinsic or baseline function of the brain, fMRI functional connectivity has significantly contributed to the understanding of schizophrenia. However, these measures may not capture the full extent of functional connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia as fMRI is temporally limited by the hemodynamic response. In order to extend fMRI functional connectivity findings, the complementary modality of magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be utilized to capture electrophysiological functional connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia that are not obtainable with fMRI. Therefore, we implemented a multimodal functional connectivity analysis using resting-state 7 Tesla fMRI and MEG data in a sample of first-episode patients with schizophrenia (n\u202f=\u202f19) and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f24). fMRI and MEG data were decomposed into components reflecting resting state networks using a group spatial independent component analysis. Functional connectivity between resting-state networks was computed and group differences were observed. In fMRI, patients demonstrated hyperconnectivity between subcortical and auditory networks, as well as hypoconnectivity between interhemispheric homotopic sensorimotor network components. In MEG, patients demonstrated hypoconnectivity between sensorimotor and task positive networks in the delta frequency band.

Therefore, as Houck and colleagues have pointed out, although fMRI provides excellent spatial resolution, sole reliance on fMRI to explore dysconnectivity is limited by the slow temporal resolution of the hemodynamic response. While fMRI measures hemodynamic changes, magnetoencephalography (MEG) enables the examination of the faster neural oscillations believed to underlie the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response of fMRI. However, just as fMRI has limited temporal resolution, the spatial resolution of MEG is limited due to the inferences necessary for signal localization and projection onto the brain.

This altered sensorimotor connectivity is consistent with previous studies demonstrating decreased interhemispheric homotopic connectivity in first-episode patients with schizophrenia.

In addition, our results are consistent with the literature indicating slow oscillations are more prone to travel longer distances and connect relatively distant regions of the brain.

In fact, a previous study of chronic schizophrenia patients indicated that the combination of fMRI and MEG functional connectivity data more accurately classifies patients than either modality alone. Furthermore, both modalities provide common and unique findings characterizing schizophrenia. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. 8, similar and spatially overlapping RSNs were generated from separate group independent component analyses of fMRI and MEG further confirming the electrophysiological underpinnings of BOLD fMRI.

To minimize variance in the data, subjects were matched on factors including age, gender, parental SES, and smoking status. As it has been shown that the early stages of schizophrenia are critical in determining the overall course and outcome of the disorder, a sample of medicated first-episode patients with schizophrenia were enrolled in the study. However, our sample size was limited and replication studies with larger sample size will be needed. Although patients were examined early in the course of the disorder and minimally treated, antipsychotic medication effects on brain function cannot be differentiated from intrinsic characteristics of the disorder. Patients in this study were receiving treatment with antipsychotic medication. Our previous fMRI studies have shown that these drugs can modify functional connectivity patterns. Further studies enrolling unmedicated or medication na\u00efve patients are needed. While rigorous preprocessing steps were implemented on both the fMRI and MEG data, heart rate and breathing were not directly controlled for during data acquisition. Although our preprocessing steps and ICA analysis attempted to control for these potential sources of noise, our results may still be impacted by artifacts due to motion or physiological processes. Subjects self-reported that they did not fall asleep during the MEG scan, but it is still possible that some may have briefly fallen asleep and impacted our results. The number of significant functional connectivity group differences reported are much smaller than typically reported in the literature. We believe our findings may be impacted by the modest sample size. In addition, we examine functional connectivity for multiple regions independently comprising a network rather than using a single network template. Therefore, as multiple networks are examined in a functional connectivity analysis, our results may be impacted by the number of comparisons being made between functional networks (e.g., over 450 and 500 comparisons for fMRI and MEG, respectively). However, we believe that the compatibility of our results with the schizophrenia literature indicate the importance of our multiple comparison corrected and uncorrected functional connectivity findings.
