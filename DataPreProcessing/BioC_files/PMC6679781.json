In this study, the correlation analysis showed that the classification score may be a valuable predictor of functional brain changes. Previous studies have demonstrated that unaffected relatives have impairments, to a lesser degree that schizophrenic patients, in the same cognitive domains, and symptomatic subjects are significantly more impaired than asymptomatic subjects in digit-symbol coding. Digit-symbol coding is an index of information processing including processing speed, associative memory, and graphomotor-speed, and is the most sensitive index of genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. It is a useful tool for quantifying cognitive impairment in schizophrenia patients and relatives at high risk of developing the illness. In this study, FDRs were categorized into two groups according to the classification scores. S-FDRs had more severe deficits contributing to functional impairment in digit symbol coding, and the classification scores of FDRs and SCZs had negatively correlations with their digit symbol coding scores, which indicated that S-FDRs might have higher risk for developing the disease. It also manifested that the classifiers built upon these FNs could serve as biomarkers for quantifying brain alternation in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25941, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present study has several limitations. First, we only have cross-sectional data of the FDRs and therefore we are not able to confirm if the S-FDRs will develop the disease in future. So far, we have followed 12 unaffected FDRs for 5 years, and they remain normal. Due to low incidence rate of schizophrenia in unaffected FDRs, longer follow-ups are needed to investigate if the S-FDRs had higher risk of development the disease than the H-FDRs. Second, the classification reliability might be affected by natural variability of the SCZs, HCs, and FDRs. The natural variability might lead to misclassification and a relatively small effect size in classification scores between the SCZs and the HCs. To gauge the classification reliability, we adopted a classification certainty measure for individual subjects. However, a large sample is needed to improve the classification reliability. Third, the family history of psychopathology was not assessed with a formal screening measure. Lastly, the participants\u2019 cognitive function was characterized by a small number of measures. Other cognitive measures should be collected to facilitate a more comprehensive characterization of the brain function for further elucidating the differences between the H-FDRs and S-FDRs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27212, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, the present study suggests that aberrant large-scale FNs identified by a pattern classification method are informative for quantifying brain alternation in schizophrenia as well as in FDRs. The S-FDRs identified based on the informative FNs were similar to the SCZs in terms of cognitive measures. The classification scores of the FDRs and SCZs were correlated with their digit symbol coding scores. These findings suggest that pattern recognition of large-scale FNs could help identify unaffected FDRs with schizophrenia-specific FC patterns, and may help early recognize and treat individuals at
