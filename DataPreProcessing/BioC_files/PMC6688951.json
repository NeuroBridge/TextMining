These findings indicate that neither sleep spindle deficits nor thalamocortical hyperconnectivity are a consequence of medications or chronicity. Nor is the relation of spindles with thalamocortical connectivity likely to be due to medications, since it was also seen in controls. That spindle and connectivity abnormalities are also present in medicated patients suggests that they are not corrected by current medication regimens for schizophrenia, and to the degree that they impair function, treating them remains an unmet need.
