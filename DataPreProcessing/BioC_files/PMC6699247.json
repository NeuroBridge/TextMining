Neural generators might be associated with a distributed network even if source localization procedures map the ERP to a focal site, as is suggested by dynamic causal modeling of ERP data.

There are some similarities between IC and OC spatial maps: N400 responses are linked to activity in the temporal poles, although with some differences in magnitude and laterality.

We interpret activity within these areas as mediating the task demands of distinguishing between conceptually related objects, a process similar to semantic interference. Our findings are in apparent contrast with prior studies which found suppression of ACC or PCC activity for IC versus OC words. Notably, these studies employed naming or lexical decision tasks, rather than a matching task, as we did. This distinction may be crucial as there is evidence for differential loci of semantic interference for word-picture naming tasks relative to word-picture matching tasks. Furthermore, matching tasks may show more robust priming effects than lexical decision tasks perhaps owing to effects of prediction.

The OC spatial map reveals activity in visual occipital areas, in addition to the temporal pole.

Visual cortex activation is consistent with semantic models of \u201cembodied abstraction\u201d in which perceptual networks are recruited in language tasks during novel or unexpected contexts.

Notably, these studies report associations with N400 amplitude, which we did not find. This may relate to differences in the priming task (matching, or lexical decision) and stimulus type (words versus pictures). The posterior cingulate / precuneus is hyperconnected in schizophrenia, with hyperconnectivity correlating with composite measures of psychopathology. Hyperconnectivity in the PCC might undermine attentional resources during cognition, destabilizing the balance between internal (often semantic) and externally directed processing. Deficient activity in the PCC during externally triggered semantic violations, as we observe, may reflect an inability in SZ to balance external attention to the semantic violation with internally oriented semantic memory. This imbalance might attribute excessive internal (self-referential or idiosyncratic) meaning to external objects, contributing to unusual thought content. Impairments in a distributed network, that includes visual and transmodal integrative centers, point toward semantic impairment in SZ at the level of semiosis: a sign process mediating internal interpretation of external objects.

In addition, the N400 shows consistency in timing across a wide range of stimulus modalities and features. Our findings suggest that the voltage time course of activation linked to these networks is remarkably similar, despite differences in spatial anatomy derived from a sluggish hemodynamic response. Although hemodynamic signals are typically considered as a surrogate for neural activity, they directly reflect vascular and metabolic activity that may be dissociated or partially uncoupled from neural activity. Cardiovascular signals interact with ongoing neural activity to influence semantic representations, so we cannot exclude the possibility that hemodynamic activity reflects embodied signals relevant to semantic processing that are distinct from neural signals.
