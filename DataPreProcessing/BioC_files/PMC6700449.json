Recently, the debate regarding the extent and nature of overlap has been rekindled, with the recognition of the dimensional nature of these disorders, as well as the acknowledgment of the significant role of social deficits in both. The two disorders have been shown to share multiple impairments in social cognition and functioning, co-occur in families at elevated rates, and share genetic as well as environmental risk factors. Consequently, they have been suggested to be closely related, and possibly lying on an etiological and neurodevelopmental continuum. Notwithstanding, differences between the disorders exist, and several models have been proposed, including independent as well as diametrical etiologies. Understanding the shared vs. distinct neural substrates of these disorders is thus crucial for clarifying their etiology, nosology and classification, as well as developing and tailoring treatments.

However, variation in results may partially reflect differences in tasks, group characteristics, and study design, rather than true differences. Three studies directly compared ASD and SZ participants using social tasks. reported that compared to SZ, ASD had greater local orbitofrontal connectivity, and reduced activity in the temporo-parietal junction and medial-prefrontal regions during a visual perspective-taking task. used a mentalizing task and demonstrated reduced STS activation in ASD and paranoid SZ, as well as unique aberrations in each of the groups. found that individuals with ASD and paranoid SZ shared reduced activation in the amygdala, fusiform and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), compared to HC during a trustworthiness task. ASD and paranoid SZ also displayed lower VLPFC activation compared to non-paranoid SZ.

Importantly, it probes neural networks known to play a central role in social cognition (, e.g. the default mode network (DMN)). Overwhelming evidence indicates that resting-state FC is altered in individuals with both schizophrenia and ASD. The extent and nature of the overlap, however, is unclear. A single study to date compared resting-state FC in ASD and SZ, using two different datasets and two separate classification analyses: one analysis examined ASD vs. HC, and the other examined SZ vs. HC. Comparison of the results by the authors indicated both shared and distinct atypical brain connections in the DMN and the salience network (SN). Shared alterations were related to the severity of social deficits in ASD. Though this study reveals valuable information, the fact that classifications were conducted separately (and on heterogeneous multisite datasets) impedes conclusions regarding group differences, and precludes classification of SZ from ASD.

Until recently, most fMRI studies assumed that FC is relatively static throughout the scan period (typically 5\u201330\u202fmin). This assumption is likely an oversimplification, as recent evidence indicates that resting-state FC fluctuates, and connectivity dynamics can capture recurring patterns of interactions among intrinsic networks. Several approaches have been developed to examine the time-varying properties of FC, the most widely used being Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity (dFNC). Similar to traditional \u201cstatic\u201d FC, connectivity is estimated as synchronized activity of distinct brain regions (and calculated as a cross-correlation matrix). However, rather than averaging across the entire scan duration, dFNC uses a sliding time-window to calculate a separate FC matrix for each time unit (for each participant). This results in a specific representation of the connectivity in each and every time segment. Then, to identify the re-occurring patterns of connectivity, data-driven clustering (k-means) is applied to all FC matrices of all participants.

They have been shown to evolve from early childhood to adulthood, underlie cognitive flexibility and executive function, and be altered in psychiatric disorders, brain injury, and sleep. Altered dynamic connectivity was reported in both ASD and SZ, and results mostly suggest that both groups spend increased time in FC states that are characterized by weak or absent connectivity, as compared to HC. However, cross-study comparison is hindered by methodological differences between studies (e.g., the SZ studies report only some aspects of temporal dynamics, states differ between studies, age-ranges vary considerably, etc.).

DA correctly identified SZ participants at high rates (sensitivity\u202f=\u202f81.8%). ASD and HC participants were correctly recognized at lower rates (50%, 41%; respectively), though importantly still above the 33% chance-level of a three-way classification. Specificity (i.e. proportion of correctly identified individuals within a cluster) was highest for HC (77%), owing mainly to the low rate of misclassified SZ in this cluster (i.e. one SZ was misclassified as HC). Specificity of the SZ cluster was 57%, with equal numbers of misclassified HC and ASD assigned to this group. ASD specificity was lowest (51%), and taken together with the relatively low specificity found in this group attests to the heterogeneity of resting-state temporal dynamics in ASD. DA further indicated low inter-subject variability in the SZ group (evident by short distances from cluster-centroid) suggesting relative homogeneity among SZ participants, while ASD and HC groups each displayed greater heterogeneity, and substantial overlap with the other groups. Together these results suggest a potential dynamic signature that is unique to SZ. Notably, participants assigned to the ASD cluster (by their dFNC pattern alone), showed more pronounced social behavior deficits. Furthermore, HC misclassified to the clinical groups displayed trend-level higher schizotypal scores. These findings support the potential clinical relevance of dFNC-based classification, as it was able to predict complex clinical manifestations, based on very few, well-defined, data-driven neural parameters. To further illustrate this point, we repeated the classification using a single summary measure of dynamics- the number of transitions (NT). NT was chosen because it is the most generalizable of all our parameters- it does not depend on the specifics of the states, or the number of different states. Classification results were overall similar (overall-sensitivity of the classification was reduced by 3.1%, compared to the original classification), providing a simple, generalizable potential marker that can be easily compared across studies regardless of the specific states identified. If such results are replicated in future studies, they could guide a more personalized conceptualization of these disorders, with the potential to assist more targeted treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37651, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Importantly, our results suggest a relationship between dFNC patterns and symptoms. Correlation analysis revealed that more severe deficits in observed social behavior (as measured by ADOS) were associated with increased DT in a state of widespread cortico-cortical connectivity (state 3), in the combined clinical sample. Follow-up analyses indicated a significant association in SZ, but not in ASD. These results reveal a unique neural correlate associated with real-life social functioning in SZ, not shared by ASD. A correlation was also found between PANSS total score and the number of transitions between states, such that more severe symptoms were associated with fewer transitions. This did not maintain statistical significance in the separate groups, however the magnitude of the correlation in SZ resembled that of the combined group, suggesting results may have been driven by SZ here as well. We note that these results did not survive correction for multiple correlations, and should hence be taken as preliminary. However, the results provide characterization of the relationship between temporal dynamics and clinical symptoms in adults with SZ and ASD. Albeit preliminary, the results suggest a continuum of brain-behavior association in SZ, that may help parse its heterogeneity, and if replicated may potentially assist clinical decision making.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39017, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Some limitations should be acknowledged: First, the groups differed in medications and IQ. We conducted sensitivity analyses and group comparisons (Appendix 5), indicating only sparse associations between dFNC indices and either IQ or medication. Sensitivity analyses between medications and IQ to clinical symptoms also produced overall null results. Our findings are thus not likely to result from these factors. Second, we cannot unequivocally rule out potential group-differences in overall clinical severity as an intermediate confound. We assessed quality of life (QOL) across all groups as a proxy of overall severity. No correlation between dFNC indices and QOL was evident in SZ or HC, and only FT2 was correlated in the ASD (Appendix 12). Additionally, PANSS' general psychopathology subscale did not correlate with any dFNC parameter in ASD or SZ, suggesting that dFNC group differences were not driven by overall-severity differences. Finally, even though previous studies have used ADOS in schizophrenia participants, and PANSS in ASD participants - the use of these scales in those populations has not been officially validated yet, and should be interpreted cautiously.
