Here, we tested this hypothesis using multi-paradigm functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from two independent twin cohorts. In a sample of 85 monozygotic (MZ) and 52 dizygotic (DZ) healthy twin pairs acquired from the Human Connectome Project, we showed that the connectivity pattern of the identified CTC circuitry was more similar in the MZ twins (r\u2009=\u20090.54) compared with that in the DZ twins (r\u2009=\u20090.22).

Moreover, using an independent schizophrenia cotwin sample (10 discordant MZ cotwins, 30 discordant DZ cotwins, and 32 control cotwins), we observed a significant linear relationship between genetic distance to schizophrenia and the connectivity strength in the CTC circuitry (i.e., schizophrenia MZ cotwins\u2009>\u2009schizophrenia DZ cotwins\u2009>\u2009control twins, P\u2009=\u20090.045).

Since the MZ correlation was larger than twice of the DZ correlation in our sample (see Results section), we estimated an ADE model using structural equation modeling (SEM). This is due to the fact that dominant genetic effects (D) would decrease the DZ correlation relative to the MZ correlation. Specifically, using the SEM toolbox OpenMx implemented in R (https://openmx.ssri.psu.edu/), we decomposed the total variance of phenotype into additive genetic effects (A), dominant genetic effects (D), and unique environmental effects (E). In general, the MZ twins share 100% of additive and dominant genetic effects, while the DZ twins share 50% and 25% of additive and dominant genetic effects, respectively. Based on this information, we estimated the squares of each path coefficients (a2, d2, e2) that reflect the proportion of phenotypic variation attributable to the A, D, E effects, respectively.

The regression analysis revealed a significant linear relationship between genetic proximity to schizophrenia and CTC connectivity in the STAR sample (P\u2009=\u20090.045, Fig. 3), suggesting that CTC connectivity is related to schizophrenia genetic risk. In particular, schizophrenia MZ cotwins showed the highest connectivity, followed by schizophrenia DZ cotwins, while control twins had the lowest connectivity, which is consistent with our prior findings that patients with schizophrenia are associated with higher connectivity in the CTC circuitry. Moreover, the inclusion of HCP data as control subjects demonstrated even stronger effect (P\u2009=\u20090.01), which further supports the idea that CTC hyperconnectivity is likely to be a heritable trait that is associated with genetic predisposition to schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17317, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Supplementary analysis on head motion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17355, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous study has reported that head motion is moderately heritable during resting-state fMRI scans.

Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a set of common genetic variants in glutamatergic genes in patients with schizophrenia, including, for instance, GRM3, GRIN2A, GRIA1, SRR, CLCN3, among others. Gene expression and brain imaging analyses suggested a converging effect of these genes on brain structure and function, especially in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. Moreover, pathway analysis also revealed a significant association of genetic variants in NMDAR complex and glutamate metabolism pathways with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In addition to common variants, rare genetic mutations such as copy number variation have also been found to be highly enriched for genes involved in the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. These lines of evidence suggest that neurotransmission-linked schizophrenia genetic factors may affect excitation\u2013inhibition balance in the human brain that further sets an over-excitatory tone for the overall brain connectivity.

The activity of the VTA dopamine neurons alters the dopamine input to the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which in turn, modulates a variety of human behaviors such as cognition, reward processing, reinforcement learning, and social activity.
