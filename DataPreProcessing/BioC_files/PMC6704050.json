In pursuit of this opportunity, we analyzed high-resolution MRI data acquired in 24 individuals with AUD and 20 age- and sex-matched controls with a 32-channel head coil using three different atlases: the online automated analysis pipeline volBrain Ceres, SUIT, and the Johns Hopkins atlas. Participants had also completed gait and balance examination and hematological analysis of nutritional and liver status, enabling testing of functional meaningfulness of each cerebellar parcellation scheme. Compared with controls, each quantification approach yielded similar patterns of group differences in regional volumes: All three approaches identified AUD-related deficits in total tissue and total gray matter, but only Ceres identified a total white matter volume deficit. Convergent volume differences occurred in lobules I-V, Crus I, VIIIB, and IX. Coefficients of variation (CVs) were <20% for 46 of 56 regions measured and in general were graded: Ceres<SUIT<Hopkins. The most robust correlations were identified between poorer stability in balancing on one leg and smaller lobule VI and Crus I volumes from the Ceres atlas. Lower values of two essential vitamins\u2014thiamine (vitamin B1) and serum folate (vitamin B9)\u2014along with lower red blood cell count, which are dependent on adequate levels of B vitamins, correlated with smaller gray matter volumes of lobule VI and Crus I. Higher \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels, possibly reflecting compromised liver function, correlated with smaller volumes of lobules VI and X.

In partial support of our prediction, we found modest volume deficits in total gray matter and lobule IX with all three methods. In addition, Ceres and SUIT identified regional volume deficits in lobules I-IV, Crus I, and VIIIB; Ceres and Hopkins identified deficits in lobule I-V. Only the Hopkins approach identified a volume deficit in Crus II. Thus the pattern of regional group differences was similar with the Ceres and SUIT methods and different from that found with the Hopkins method. Reasons for these differences may be due to parcellation schemes; for example, the Hopkins method distinguishes regions assigned to the vermis that might be included in hemispheric lobular volumes in Ceres and SUIT.

Clearly, all three cerebellar quantification methods examined herein produced similar patterns of group differences and relations with performance and biological data, suggesting that any of the three methods may be used in human studies to seek diagnostic effects or functional correlates of regional cerebellar gray matter volumes. An exemplary impetus for exploring a selective projection in humans comes from a triad of novel studies. The first used optogenetic stimulation in mice and revealed a monosynaptic projection from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), implicated in rewarding features of addiction and control of social behavior. Consistent with this newly identified structural circuitry, a second study used resting-state fMRI in healthy young adults and identified a functional network involving cerebellum (dentate nuclei, VIIA, and VI), posterior insula, parietal sensory cortex, and amygdala, possibly contributing to emotional and motivational integration. The third study used a primate model and rabies virus labeling, which revealed that lobules VB-VIIIB of the vermis receive dense input from primary motor cortex, suggesting a cortico-cerebellar regulation of gait and posture.
