Reinforcement learning is driven by midbrain dopamine neurons encoding violations of expected reward outcomes, known as reward prediction error (RPE) signals. Specifically, unexpected reward elicits a phasic increase in firing of dopamine neurons, whereas omission of an expected reward results in a phasic decrease in firing. Midbrain RPE signals are thought to act as a learning signal which is fed through fronto-cortical basal ganglia loops in order to adjust behaviour accordingly. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain regions which are densely innervated by dopamine neurons, particularly the striatum and aspects of the prefrontal cortex, typically show activation reflective of an RPE response, in line with the notion that the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal likely reflects the information an area is receiving and processing. A recent meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of prediction error during reinforcement learning confirmed robust prediction error activation in both ventral and dorsal aspects of the striatum as well as cortical regions including medial prefrontal, inferior and superior frontal, inferior parietal, and occipital cortex. Consistent with pathologically increased tonic striatal dopamine in schizophrenia, phasic RPE signaling in the striatum has been shown to be reduced in schizophrenia patients, a finding attributed to \u201cdrowning\u201d of these phasic signals due to elevated presynaptic dopamine. As the primary target of dopaminergic neurons, the ventral striatum has been a major region of interest for reinforcement learning studies in schizophrenia; however, impaired RPE signaling has also been detected in patients in additional areas such as prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. Furthermore, there is evidence that reward feedback processing and RPE signaling in schizophrenia is selectively impaired for reward outcomes, but largely intact for loss outcomes, typically consisting of omission of expected reward. While meta-analytic findings have shown some overlap of neural regions processing reward and punishment in healthy individuals including in the striatum und medial frontal cortex, encoding of prediction errors during gain and loss outcomes appears to be spatially segregated in temporal and occipital regions. This supports the possibility that the reward processing network could be selectively impaired in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5545, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The question of whether a common dopaminergic abnormality underlies both treatment responsive and treatment resistant schizophrenia remains largely unresolved. Recent evidence suggests that elevated striatal dopamine synthesis capacity is specific to treatment responsive schizophrenia, whereas anterior cingulate glutamate levels may be selectively increased in TRS. However, the neural activation associated with dopamine functioning in the context of reinforcement learning has not been explicitly compared between these patient groups. Given the link between dopamine and RPE activation, a normal RPE signature would be expected in TRS if dopamine function is indeed unimpaired in this group. In contrast, treatment responsive patients would be expected to exhibit the abnormal RPE activation typically associated with schizophrenia. Note that behavior may be similarly impaired in the two groups if distinct nodes of the same reward network are differentially impaired. Reinforcement learning relies not only on striatal dopamine function, but also on complex fronto-striatal interactions regulating related processes such as cognitive control, goal maintenance and planning, as well as action value and effort computations. As bottom-up learning signals are utilized to update a model of the surrounding environment, it is necessary to exert top-down cognitive control-particularly in the presence of persistent cognitive or behavioral bias-in order to optimise task focused learning. As such, it is possible that even with intact RPE signaling, a lack of cognitive control modulating learning processes could lead to a disruption of reinforcement learning. Notably, glutamatergic dysfunction may be associated with these cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia, providing a useful explanatory mechanisms for potential deficits in TRS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7391, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we aimed to tap into these processes by quantifying cognitive bias in a reinforcement learning task and observing its modulation of RPE signaling.

Group differences observed in the ROI analyses are highly likely to reflect dopaminergic functioning, given that the striatum and thalamus receive dense dopamine projections from the midbrain. Our findings thus imply that putatively dopamine-driven mechanisms underlying reinforcement learning in response to reward feedback are selectively disrupted in NTR. In contrast, the similar RPE-related activation pattern in TRS patients and HC suggests that reinforcement learning deficits in this patient group do not stem from dopaminergically driven RPE signaling dysfunctions. The data are consistent with the notion that TRS patients do not respond to dopaminergic antipsychotic medication because a dopaminergic abnormality is not the primary cause of symptoms in this subgroup. Importantly, medication dosage did not significantly differ between the two patient groups in our sample. Non-response to medication in the TRS group is unlikely to arise from a lower prescribed medication dosage compared to NTR patients as CPZ equivalent dosages were descriptively higher in the TRS group. However, due to the illness chronicity of patients included in our sample it was not possible to exhaustively ascertain the exact dosage and duration of all previous medication trials, thus cumulative medication exposure remains as a potential confound in this study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26763, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interestingly, groups did not differ in terms of their bias towards choosing the happy face over the angry face on emotional trials. However, there was a significant difference between TRS and NTR patients in how this bias was associated with RPE signal in the thalamus and caudate during loss processing. In NTR patients, a strong emotional bias was associated with further attenuation of the RPE signal. By comparison, emotional bias in TRS was associated with an increased RPE signal. In turn, RPE signal in this region was positively related to delusional symptom severity specifically in the TRS group. This is surprising as striatal RPE signal has previously been reported to be negatively linked with symptom severity in schizophrenia; in line with the view that hyperdopaminergia-reflected in reduced RPE signaling-drives psychosis. Our findings suggest that this relationship may be inverted in TRS patients in the thalamus and caudate. Increased RPE signaling specifically on loss trials may reflect less accurate predictions, resulting in greater prediction errors when the outcome is negative. As such, a strong social bias in TRS may lead to worse predictions about outcomes but an intact subcortical response to prediction error, which in turn is not adequately utilized to update predictions. In contrast, in NTR the prediction error response itself seems to be impaired, an effect which is further augmented in the presence of cognitive bias.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28222, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These data support a putative model of TRS whereby the central dysfunction lies not in the subcortical dopamine system itself, but in the implementation of cognitive control mechanisms interacting with this system. This control could be contributed to by glutamatergic mechanisms. The striatum and cortex are interconnected by multiple partially overlapping circuits subserving learning and flexible cognition. The ability to maintain behavioural goals in the presence of interference, uncertainty, or bias-broadly the definition of cognitive control-is an integral aspect of feedback learning. A breakdown of this system may not only lead to reinforcement learning deficits, but also psychotic symptoms such as delusions as control processes are not adequately exerted in order to update internal models of the environment. Control-related regions such as prefrontal cortex, which also shows strong functional connectivity with the striatum, may indeed be involved in delusion formation and maintenance. Arguably, in the absence of an adequate cognitive control mechanism regulating bias, solely targeting subcortical dopamine with antipsychotics may not suffice to alleviate symptoms. In contrast, NTR patients may have sufficient cognitive control such that alleviating the striatal dysfunction is sufficient to reduce symptoms adequately.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29565, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study offers the first task-related neuroimaging evidence for differential caudate function in chronic TRS and NTR patients. It has been suggested that metabolic as well as anatomical abnormalities in the basal ganglia including the caudate nucleus are involved in TRS and may also be associated with clozapine response. For example, clozapine responders show hypermetabolism in the thalamus and basal ganglia, which is reduced following successful clozapine treatment. A reduction of metabolism specifically in the caudate after clozapine response was observed more recently and clozapine administration is associated with a reduction of caudate volume. Notably, treatment responsive patients were found to have increased dopamine synthesis capacity compared to TRS, a finding which was most strong in the caudate nucleus. Thus the caudate may constitute an interesting target for further investigation of TRS in studies stratifying patient subgroups by response.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30534, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The study has certain limitations common to fMRI studies of a potential selection bias in medicated patients suitable for scanning; however, there are scant studies comparing TRS and NTR patients and withdrawal from medication for the purposes of imaging is not ethical. We did not include patients treated with clozapine in order to maintain the homogeneity of the patient sample and TRS patients fulfilled the standard criteria for treatment resistance-thus avoiding the introduction of sub-groups of patients refractory to clozapine (super-resistant patients). The differences in striatal RPE activation between groups are apparent at a liberal statistical threshold uncorrected for multiple comparisons; however, the consistent pattern of hypoactivation in NTR patients across the network lends support to this finding as a true positive.

The data support the idea that TRS may represent a different disease from treatment responsive schizophrenia; confirming the evidence from clinical observation that TRS does not fit well into the contemporary dopaminergic dysfunction model of schizophrenia. Despite extensive research on task-related neural activity in schizophrenia, studies typically do not use key stratifiers to reduce the heterogeneity of the sample and are likely combining neurobiologically distinct subtypes of schizophrenia. This not only clouds studies of mechanism, but potentially also of treatment trials; missing effects that are specific to one or the other subset of patients. There is an urgent need for stratification of patients by response; both at the chronic stage of the illness and in patients suffering a first episode of psychosis. Indeed recent data following up first episode samples of patients with schizophrenia suggests that over 70% of treatment resistant cases are apparent at onset. The separation of schizophrenia subgroups will allow the development of clearer hypotheses into the neural mechanisms underlying antipsychotic treatment response and potentially move us closer to being able to use these biomarkers to tailor treatment in a more personalized and effective manner.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33064, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33087, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Conflict of interest", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33108, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "None", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33113, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Ethical standards", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33131, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33372, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint first Authors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33493, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33504, "infons": {"name_0": "surname:Adams;given-names:RA", "name_1": "surname:Stephan;given-names:KE", "name_2": "surname:Brown;given-names:HR", "name_3": "surname:Frith;given-names:CD", "name_4": "surname:Friston;given-names:KJ", "section_type": "REF", "source": "The computational anatomy of psychosis", "type": "ref", "year": "2013"}, "text": "", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33505, "infons": {"fpage": "441", "lpage": "449", "name_0": "surname:Andreasen;given-names:NC", "name_1": "surname:Carpenter;given-names:WT;suffix:Jr", "name_2": "surname:Kane;given-names:JM", "name_3": "surname:Lasser;given-names:RA", "name_4": "surname:Marder;given-names:SR", "name_5": "surname:Weinberger;given-names:DR", "pub-id_pmid": "15741458", "section_type": "REF", "source": "American Journal of Psychiatry", "type": "ref", "volume": "162", "year": "2005"}, "text": "Remission in schizophrenia: proposed criteria and rationale for consensus", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33579, "infons": {"fpage": "599", "name_0": "surname:Averbeck;given-names:BB", "name_1": "surname:Duchaine;given-names:B", "pub-id_pmid": "19803582", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Emotion", "type": "ref", "volume": "9", "year": "2009"}, "text": "Integration of social and utilitarian factors in decision making", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33644, "infons": {"fpage": "919", "lpage": "934", "name_0": "surname:Barch;given-names:DM", "name_1": "surname:Dowd;given-names:EC", "pub-id_pmid": "20566491", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Schizophrenia Bulletin", "type": "ref", "volume": "36", "year": "2010"}, "text": "Goal representations and motivational drive in schizophrenia: the role of prefrontal-striatal interactions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33751, "infons": {"fpage": "40", "lpage": "48", "name_0": "surname:Bazire;given-names:S", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Dementia", "type": "ref", "year": "2005"}, "text": "Psychotropic drug directory.
