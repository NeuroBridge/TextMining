Both HIV and stimulants are independently associated with deficits in reward-based decision making, but their interactive and/or additive effects are poorly understood despite their prevalent comorbidity. Here, we examined the effects of cocaine dependence and HIV infection in 69 adults who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while completing an economic loss aversion task. We identified two neural networks that correlated with the evaluation of the favorable characteristics of the gamble (i.e., higher gains/lower losses; ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, anterior and posterior precuneus, and visual cortex) versus unfavorable characteristics of the gamble (i.e., lower gains/higher losses; dorsal prefrontal, lateral orbitofrontal, and posterior parietal cortex, anterior insula, and dorsal caudate). Behaviorally, cocaine and HIV had additive effects on loss aversion scores, with HIV-positive cocaine users being the least loss averse. Cocaine users had greater activation in brain regions that tracked the favorability of gamble characteristics (i.e., increased activation to gains, but decreased activation to losses). In contrast, HIV infection was independently associated with lesser activation in regions that tracked the unfavorability of gamble characteristics. These results suggest that cocaine is associated with an overactive reward-seeking system, while HIV is associated with an underactive cognitive control system.

During cognitively demanding tasks, HIV is generally associated with hyperactivity in brain regions implicated in executive control, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and striatum.

In another sample of 56 healthy adults, gain-related activation was similarly identified in the OFC and DLPFC, cingulate, thalamus, and right striatum. This group also identified loss-related activation in the right amygdala and somatosensory cortex, and thus concluded that the valuation of potential gains and losses involves multiple neural systems. Like both of these studies, we identified overlapping gain-related activations and loss-related deactivations in mOFC/VMPFC and ACC (i.e., gamble-favorability network), regions that are frequently linked to reward-based decision making. In this network we also identified limbic (i.e., amygdala and hippocampal) activation in response to gains, which is consistent with other studies supporting the role of the limbic system in loss aversion.

Altogether, the reward-based/limbic network may mediate emotion-driven influences on gamble selection, while the cognitive control network is sensitive to factors that make gamble selection more difficult (e.g., increasing potential loss) and contributes to deliberate, conscious decisions to accept or reject each gamble.

Furthermore, cocaine users had greater gain-related activation than non-cocaine users in several regions in the gamble-favorability network. These differences were evidenced primarily in response to gains, not losses. While drug abuse is associated with striatal hypoactivation in tasks involving monetary reward anticipation, there has been relatively less research on the role of the PFC in monetary decision making. There is evidence that cocaine users may be less sensitive to increases in monetary rewards, but this may depend on the range of values. For example, found that cocaine users overvalued small rewards and undervalued large rewards (up to $1,000), and that this reduced sensitivity to increasing reward value correlated with greater activations in the lOFC/VLPFC. The gambles in our study had gain values ranging from $0\u201340, which may help to explain the observed hyperactivation in the medial PFC and ACC. Our results support the hypothesis that risky choice in cocaine users may relate to an overactive reward-seeking system. HIV infection appeared to moderate this effect in the VMPFC and posterior precuneus, such that the cocaine-associated hyperactivity observed in HIV-negative individuals was reduced in HIV-positive individuals.

Differences were found primarily in the gamble-unfavorability network, suggesting an underactive cognitive control system in the valuation of potential losses. Compared to HIV-negative participants, HIV-positive participants had lesser activation in the VLPFC, lOFC, dorsal PFC, central precuneus, PPC, and thalamus. This finding is consistent with a growing number of studies that have identified HIV-associated alterations in the fronto-parietal network. While a recent review concluded that HIV-positive persons demonstrate hyperactivity in task-relevant regions despite equivalent performance, a few studies have also reported hypoactivations. For example, found that HIV was associated with hypoactivation in the ventral striatum during a task involving reward anticipation and reward outcome. Consistent with compensation theory, two recent studies have shown that HIV-positive participants exhibit greater activation on easier tasks, but lesser activation as the task becomes more difficult. In another fMRI study that examined decision making in the context of uncertainty, HIV-positive individuals had greater activation than HIV-negative individuals in the ACC, DLPFC, basal ganglia, and thalamus when choosing risky gambles, but lesser activation in the ACC and DLPFC when choosing safe gambles. The authors suggested that this may reflect overvaluation of larger rewards that are associated with uncertain outcomes (high gain/high risk). Thus, inconsistencies may reflect differences in the experimental paradigms utilized across studies. Collectively, these studies indicate that HIV is associated with dysregulation in fronto-parietal and sub-cortical regions during risky decision making.

The strengths of our study include a robust sample size of 69, closely matched groups in terms of demographics, cocaine use, and HIV disease characteristics, and the use of a previously validated paradigm to examine neural activation in response to gain and loss valuation during economic risky choice. Since both cocaine and HIV are known to affect the neural systems involved in decision making, it is not surprising that we found a wider range of neural responsiveness to both gain and loss than previously reported. Nevertheless, comparisons to previous studies should be interpreted with caution, since subtle variations in data collection, processing, and statistical modeling would affect results. Our study is also not without limitations. Despite the relatively large sample, we were underpowered to detect small interaction effects between cocaine and HIV on the neural processing of gain and loss. Second, to simplify the interpretation of the main effects in this multi-group analysis, this study focused on identifying responses to gain and loss separately. This strategy allowed us to identify the unique effects of HIV and cocaine on the discrete networks associated in the valuation of risky monetary choices. Future studies may consider also examining the simultaneous evaluation of loss and gain, as was done as a follow-up analysis in the study. Furthermore, while we refer to discrete gain-and loss-related networks, we did not perform analyses of functional or effectivity connectivity of these networks. Such analyses could determine the extent to which these networks overlap in space or function. Finally, although participants were excluded for any history of \u201chard\u201d drug use, we permitted the use of alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine due to their high prevalence in cocaine-using populations. Since cocaine users were indeed more likely than the non-cocaine users to use these substances, it is possible that the identified effects are not specific to cocaine, but rather to poly-drug use.

These neural alterations may help to explain the high rates of risk-taking in HIV-positive drug users, including sexual risk behaviors and poor medication adherence that contribute to the forward transmission of HIV to others. Treatment approaches that reward the inhibition of unhealthy behaviors (e.g., contingency management) may capitalize on the hyper-responsivity to gains observed in persons with cocaine use disorders. At the same time, cognitive training interventions that improve functioning of the cognitive control system in HIV-positive persons may improve decision making by increasing responsivity to unfavorable risks. Multi-pronged interventions that target both of these neural systems may have promise for improving decision making in this high-risk group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []},
