While HIV is also associated with altered neural activation, it is not known how marijuana may further affect brain function in this population. Our study examined the independent and additive effects of HIV infection and regular marijuana use on neural activation during a cognitive interference task. The sample included 93 adults who differed on marijuana and HIV statuses (20 MJ+/HIV+, 19 MJ+/HIV\u2212, 29 MJ\u2212/HIV+, 25 MJ\u2212/HIV\u2212). Participants completed a counting Stroop task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Main and interactive effects on neural activation during interference versus neutral blocks were examined using a mixed-effects analysis. The sample showed the expected Stroop effect for both speed and accuracy. There were main effects of MJ in the right and left inferior parietal lobules, with the left cluster extending into the posterior middle temporal gyrus, and a main effect of HIV in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. There was an interaction in the left fronto-insular cortex, such that the MJ+/HIV+ group had the largest increase in activation compared to other groups. Among MJ+, signal change in this cluster correlated positively with cumulative years of regular marijuana use.

In response to interference compared to neutral trials, marijuana users had larger increases in activation in the right and left supramarginal gyrus, with the left cluster extending into the posterior MTG. These findings are consistent with prior studies on the effects of chronic marijuana use, which generally report alterations in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions during cognitive tasks. Such hyperactivity may serve as a mechanism to compensate for decreased efficiency and neural capacity due to marijuana use. Compensatory theories posit that, in order to preserve cognitive function, additional regions that are not typically activated for a specific task must be engaged to maintain performance. Neural activation in the inferior parietal lobule, and in particular the supramarginal gyrus, is critical to successful inhibitory control, while the left posterior MTG is part of a semantic control network that plays an important role in capturing context-sensitive meaning. Thus, it may be that marijuana users must employ additional neural resources in regions related to cognitive and semantic control to perform the Stroop task at the same level as non-marijuana users.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25072, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "As expected, we observed a main effect of HIV that encompassed a large portion of the dorsal ACC. As a core region of the executive control system, the dorsal ACC is believed to allocate attentional resources to mediate response selection in the face of competing information-processing streams. While the sample overall had increased BOLD signal in the dorsal ACC, HIV+ participants also showed increased activation in ventral and rostral portions of the ACC that deactivated in HIV\u2212 participants. This effect was evident in both marijuana and non-marijuana users. HIV-associated hyperactivity has also been conceptualized using compensatory models. Given the role of the dorsal ACC in supporting optimal allocation of executive control, it may be that HIV+ persons need to engage this region to achieve similar task performance. Surprisingly, there was no relationship between nadir CD4 count, a clinical marker of HIV neurologic disease, and signal change.

We identified an interaction in the left fronto-insular cortex, such that the effect of marijuana was evident in HIV+ but not HIV\u2212 persons. Signal change in this cluster correlated with cumulative years of use, and this effect was more pronounced in HIV+ persons. Prior studies have found that chronic marijuana use is associated with hyperactivity in the insula during attention and response inhibition tasks, as well as higher resting-state functional connectivity in the orbitofrontal network and between insula and executive control regions. Altogether, our results suggest that HIV+ persons are more vulnerable to the long-term effects of regular marijuana use and accumulated exposure to cannabis.

Importantly, participants could have no history of abuse of drugs other than marijuana. However, to ensure generalizability, nicotine and non-problematic alcohol use were permitted. As expected, the MJ+ group was more likely than the MJ\u2212 group to smoke cigarettes, and most marijuana users smoked the drug in the form of blunts containing nicotine. As a result, we were unable to control for the independent effects of nicotine. It is possible that our results may be partially driven by co-occurring nicotine use. Future studies should stratify groups by cigarette status and assess nicotine exposure during marijuana administration. Finally, nearly all members of our MJ+ group were characterized by chronic and heavy marijuana use, limiting our ability to examine the potential effects of quantity and frequency of current use.

First, since our version of the counting Stroop task did not include an inter-block interval, we were unable to quantify the degree of activation from baseline. This would more directly test hypotheses related to neural efficiency and capacity in response to increasing cognitive load. Second, the data are from one 4-minute run, which may have limited power to detect group differences. However, this is the duration recommended for the counting Stroop task, and the task evoked robust activity within expected regions. Third, despite the large overall sample, the sub-groups ranged in size from 19\u201329, limiting our ability to detect small effects, although we identified robust effects of marijuana and HIV in multiple regions. Finally, since the study was cross- sectional, causality cannot be inferred. It is possible that group differences in neural function preceded the onset of marijuana use and/or HIV infection.

The effects of marijuana on parietal regions of the executive control network affected HIV+ and HIV\u2212 participants similarly. In contrast, alterations in the left fronto-insular cortex were evident only in HIV+ marijuana users. Despite performing the counting Stroop with equivalent speed and accuracy, HIV+ marijuana users had exaggerated hyperactivations in this cluster. Given the role of the component regions in emotional and reward decision making, HIV+ marijuana users may be more prone to impulsive behaviors. Future studies should examine how these alterations may affect real-world functioning, such as employment and medication adherence. Given the high prevalence of marijuana use in HIV+ persons - both for recreational and medical purposes - more research is needed to determine if factors such as age of onset and quantity/frequency of
