These signals provide temporally dynamic maps of the body's homeostatic and physiological milieu at both conscious and unconscious levels of awareness which convey information critical for adaptive behaviors. The various sources of interoceptive information (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, immunological, etc.) are conveyed to the Central Nervous System (CNS), where they become integrated in somatosensory and viscerosensory representation. The primary neurofunctional pathways associated with interoception include the c-fiber and spinothalamic afferents, vagal afferent fibers, and specific brainstem and thalamic nuclei, which project to the insula. The influence of top-down control is evident from the up-regulation of activity linked to interoceptive signal processing in CNS (e.g., especially sectors of the insula) when attention is explicitly directed at bodily sensations and down-regulation when attention is directed away from bodily sensations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3954, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There is presently growing interest in the role of interoception and (interoceptive dysfunction) in psychopathology (for a summary see the Biological Psychiatry consensus statement from the 2016 Interoception Summit). Interoception may be an important factor in substance use disorder (SUD), and in recovery from addiction. For instance, psychoactive drugs stimulate bodily sensations (e.g., via autonomic system stimulation) and these sensations may become part of the feelings sought by frequent users. Similarly, withdrawal is marked by aversive interoceptive signals (e.g., aching and nausea) which can drive motivation to use. Interoceptive signals contribute to drug craving and to mood states which can also be triggers for drug use. A chronic use history with a particular drug may alter the response to interoceptive signals, particularly when those signals are directly linked to the rewarding drug. For example, sympathetic arousal accompanying danger may normally provoke caution, but may provoke approach behavior in a cocaine-dependent individual, since the interoceptive signals of sympathetic activation are similar to those accompanying acute cocaine intake. In addition, impairment (or neglect) of interoceptive information could diminish the capacity for insight regarding problem drug use. Interestingly, alexithymia, the inability to recognize one's own emotional states, is associated with interoceptive deficits and is frequently comorbid with SUD. Alexithymia also predicts poorer long-term outcomes in treatment for SUD, suggesting the possibility that the interoceptive signals informing emotional awareness might be important resources for addiction recovery. Indeed several models of addiction treatment, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based interventions explicitly work with clients to help them better recognize their own bodily sensations. For example, in CBT, clients are taught to work to monitor their body for sensations of craving and to, \u201cpay attention to all the somatic and affective signals and try to put them into words.

In line with these behavioral observations, PTSD and sexual trauma have previously been associated with altered brain metabolism in regions associated with interoceptive and somatosensory processing. Specifically, women with PTSD due to intimate partner violence have blunted subjective pain and pain-linked anterior insula responses that are inversely correlated with avoidant symptoms, and (primarily) female patients with dissociative PTSD show reduced functional connectivity of vestibular brainstem nuclei with a parieto-posterior insula network and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7190, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Trauma and substance abuse comorbidity", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7229, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Exposure to traumatic events are as high as 93% in some SUD samples.

These findings suggest that there may be distinctive correlates of traumatic stress and brain function among individuals with SUD. However, neither study included participants with PTSD diagnoses, a clinically relevant distinction, since exposure to trauma-categoric events in absence of post-traumatic stress symptoms may not have the same effect on brain function, nor the course and outcome of a SUD. It remains the case that PTSD has, to our knowledge, not yet been evaluated in a neuroimaging study of a substance-dependent population. Given that women with SUDs experience markedly higher rates of trauma and PTSD relative to men with SUDs, especially due to interpersonal and domestic violence, there is a clear need to investigate neurobiological correlates in trauma-exposed, substance-dependent women with-and-without current PTSD diagnoses, as it may reveal functional differences with clinical implications.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9352, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The primary goal of the present report is to characterize deficits in interoceptive processing associated with PTSD comorbidity in a sample of women with SUD.

The approach contrasts brain activity during attention to the sensations of breathing versus attention to an external target. By contrasting internally and externally directed focus, this approach capitalizes on the \u201cattentional spotlight\u201d effect, whereby focus on a sensory quality amplifies the signal within brain regions associated with processing that sensory modality. Variations on this task have previously been used to isolate BOLD responses in regions associated with interoception in expert meditators, healthy individuals, as well as in clinical populations with depression and anorexia nervosa. The magnitude of insula response during focused breathing tasks appears to track the quality of internal focus, which increases as a function of hours practiced in novices who participated in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program. During the IN-OUT task participants performed two experimental conditions involving sustained attentional targets: the interoceptive (IN) condition and the exteroceptive (OUT) condition. Participants completed two runs, each containing nine blocks. The blocks were presented in pseudorandomized order- half of the runs contained five blocks of IN, and four blocks of OUT, while other blocks contained four blocks of IN and five blocks of OUT. For the IN condition, subjects were instructed to attend to bodily sensations associated with their breathing cycle with the following instructions: \u201cPlease pay attention to the physical sensation of the breath wherever you feel it most strongly in the body. Follow the natural and spontaneous movement of the breath, not trying to change it in any way. Just pay attention to it. If you find that your attention has wandered to something else, gently but firmly bring it back to the physical sensations of the breath in the body\u201d. During the IN condition, an \u201cO\u201d appeared on the center of the screen for 36\u202fs, on which subjects were instructed to fix their gaze while simultaneously attending to the sensations of their breathing cycle. The OUT condition consisted of a \u201c1-back\u201d task, which we considered to be an attention control condition.

This approach allows identification of group differences in spatial connectivity of functional networks. We carried out dual regression on each group-level network individually, excluding: 1) the six networks deemed artifactual based on visual inspection and comparison with canonical networks and 2) the six networks that were not found to be significantly task-related (see Section 3.6 below).

These eight task-modulated networks were used to test network-level differences in functional connectivity for participants with comorbid PTSD and SUD compared to those with SUD-only. Only the OFC network significantly differentiated the PTSD and noPTSD groups. Notably, we did not identify brain or performance differences (see Supplement) between PTSD and noPTSD for networks associated with exteroceptive task demands (the executive, lateral occipital, and occipital pole networks). Rather, group differences were found for the OFC network, whose time course was more active when participants were cued to attend to the sensations associated with their breathing cycle.

In general, the OFC is functionally and anatomically coupled with the insula, striatum, lateral prefrontal cortices, and limbic structures. In relation to complex behaviors, the OFC is integral to functional states related to homeostasis and allostasis, such as mood and emotion, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis (HPA) activity, reward, and decision-making. Our observation of diminished OFC strength and functional connectivity in the PTSD group is highly consistent with many prior studies of post-traumatic stress in non-substance dependent individuals, who show reduced orbitofrontal or ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) metabolism across a variety of task-demands, including trauma-related and trauma-unrelated task contexts.

It is possible that depressed metabolism and volume of the OFC is a consequence of early experiences, which generate a vulnerability for the development of PTSD in response to traumas. Alternatively, OFC atrophy and hypometabolism could also reflect the neurobiological consequences of traumatic stress and PTSD itself. Suggestively, report that maltreated youth with PTSD have decreased VMPFC gray matter volume relative both to maltreated youth without PTSD and non-maltreated controls. More directly, Dahlgren and colleagues reported a twin study indicating that diminished medial prefrontal function is an acquired (rather than pre-existing) feature of PTSD. Our data also suggest that diminished OFC network strength is predictive of current PTSD. We further observed that the strength of the OFC network for each subject was negatively associated with the severity of sexual trauma history across all participants, over-and-above the contribution of PTSD status alone.

Concerning visceral and somatic sensation, the PTSD group demonstrated reduced bilateral mid-posterior insula and somatosensory cortex functional connectivity with the OFC network, which may suggest weaker interoceptive and somatic representations of the body and viscera during breath awareness. The mid-posterior insula is the terminus of major vagal and spinothalamic lamina I pathways that convey homeostatic and viscerosensory information to the cortex. Activity in this region is responsive to homeostatic states and interoceptive manipulations. According to one model, interoceptive information is propagated along a posterior-anterior axis in the insula, eventually reaching the orbitofrontal cortices, whereby visceral status can affect mood as well as goal-directed behaviors, including drug seeking. Mindful or attentive breathing exercises can be seen as an interoceptive manipulation. Brief interventions that employ attention to breathing are known to transiently decrease subjective states of distress in both clinical and healthy populations. In an fMRI paradigm, attention to breathing also downregulates amygdala responses and increases prefrontal activity during emotional picture viewing, which suggests a potential brain mechanism through which mindfulness practices may support emotion regulation. Activation of lateral prefrontal regions are also observed in fMRI studies of focused-meditation. In particular, reported that greater dorsolateral prefrontal activity was associated with periods of greater self-reported focus during such exercises, whereas it diminished during periods of mind-wandering and \u201cawareness of\u201d mindbwandering. These reports suggest that cognitive control is required to sustain attention on body sensations and inhibit mind-wandering. In our study we observed reduced OFC functional connectivity with the dorsal and ventrolateral prefrontal regions in the PTSD group relative to the noPTSD group. Furthermore, it is reported that in women with PTSD, low executive functioning is related to greater intrusive thought persistence and cognitive avoidance strategies.

Associative pairing of self to a visual symbol also activates these regions relative to associative pairing of visual symbols to non-self objects, and lesions of the extrastriate and temporo-parietal cortices can produce disorders of bodily self-consciousness, and these regions appear to be relevant to dissociative PTSD.

Mindfulness treatments tailored to women with comorbid substance abuse and traumatic stress may be especially suited for addressing dysregulated stress responses that can precipitate relapse. Specifically, certain mindfulness exercises such as focused breathing and the body scan may act as a form of interoceptive exposure therapy, as well as serve to re-integrate an embodied sense of self, and down-regulate stress-reactivity. In healthy individuals, mindfulness training has been found to strengthen white matter connectivity between insula and the prefrontal cortex, including the OFC.

However, we employed nonparametric permutation methods for inference of group differences, a statistically strict method which has been shown to generate minimal levels of false positives relative to parametric methods of inference, and we applied Bonferroni correction on the tests performed, further reducing the potential for false positives. Moreover, the observation of depressed OFC network function and connectivity is highly consistent with prior studies. Nevertheless, the risk of Type 1 error related to \u201cfile-drawer problems\u201d is heightened when sample sizes are small, as is the case in the present study, and so the results presented here should not be taken as definitive. Second, this study was cross-sectional, therefore the design does not allow us to distinguish whether group differences in brain metabolism are antecedent (and perhaps causal contributors) to the development of PTSD or whether these differences are related to the sequelae of PTSD (or the sequelae of PTSD in the context of addiction). Although psychoactive medication use was similar across the two groups, the potential influence of these medications could not be ruled out. We were also not able to exclude subjects on the basis of psychiatric comorbidities apart from PTSD. However, comorbidity in SUD is common, and in the present study the rates of mood and borderline disorders were similar between PTSD and noPTSD groups, thus these data may be more representative of female SUD populations, thereby supporting the generalizability of the findings. Nevertheless, it is not entirely clear how substance use may have interacted with the present findings (i.e. limiting its generalizability to PTSD specifically). OFC gray matter and functional impairments have also been noted in substance abuse disorders. Similarly, interoceptive processing deficits have also been observed in substance dependent individuals without PTSD. Consequently, it is not clear whether PTSD results in primary deficits in processing somato-visceral information relative to SUD, or whether this relative difference might be a consequence of a supraordinate factor such as attentional difficulties (although there were no performance differences in the exteroceptive task [see Supplement]). However, since we did not have a measure of performance difficulty for the two task conditions, we also cannot be certain whether perceived difficulty played a role. Behavioral measures of interoception should be incorporated in future studies, or, alternatively, could utilize assessments of interoceptive function that do not necessarily impose attentional or cognitive demands (e.g. pharmacological challenges). To address these interpretive ambiguities, future studies could incorporate demographically matched, non-substance abusing comparison groups with-and-without trauma/PTSD to identify associations of the OFC and interoceptive networks that are uniquely related to substance abuse versus those related to PTSD, and potential interactions between the disorders. Lastly, in the current study we only assessed participants at a single time-point, soon after admission to SUD treatment, thus we do not know how interoceptive, somatosensory and orbitofrontal function may change with treatment.
