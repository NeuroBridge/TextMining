Poor treatment outcomes for tobacco use disorder testify to the addiction liability of nicotine, which, like other drugs of abuse, leads to increased local concentration of dopamine (DA) within the mesocorticolimbic (MCL) circuit when acutely administered. Nicotine stimulates midbrain DA neurons projecting primarily to striatal and prefrontal brain regions through agonist effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). During the initiation of use, acute nicotine-induced DA release is thought to positively reinforce continued drug seeking and taking. As initial use transitions to chronic smoking, neuroplastic alterations within the MCL circuit and beyond are thought to induce a condition of dependence/addiction accompanied by a shift toward negative reinforcement mechanisms perpetuating continued use. Abrupt smoking cessation perturbs homeostasis maintained in the presence of chronic nicotine, giving rise to the nicotine withdrawal syndrome.

Nicotine delivery via smoking ameliorates acute abstinence-induced dysregulation of affective, cognitive, and reward processes, thereby perpetuating smoking via negative reinforcement. However, emerging evidence suggests a distinction in the neural responses contributing to smoker\u2019s dysregulated reward processing such that nicotine administration may normalize blunted striatal activity linked with reward anticipation, but not with reward receipt. As opposed to being modulated by acute nicotine administration, blunted striatal responsivity to reward receipt has been linked with measures of chronic nicotine exposure, including scores on the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and years of daily smoking. Accordingly, we have previously proposed that blunted striatal responsivity is linked with trait-level addiction severity, whereas other neurobiological circuits (e.g., those centered on the insula) are linked with state-level nicotine withdrawal.

The habenula is a small epithalamic nucleus that integrates information from limbic forebrain regions to modulate midbrain structures involved in monoamine neurotransmission and thus has been linked with reward, anxiety, stress, cognitive, and motor processes. The habenula is divided into lateral and medial parts. The lateral habenula plays an important role in reward processing, specifically, when an expected reward is omitted, increased activity in the lateral habenula is thought to inhibit DAergic midbrain cells leading to decreased DA signaling in the striatum. Moreover, the medial habenula is of particular interest in the context of nicotine addiction as it has a high density of nAChRs and has been functionally linked with nicotine self-administration as well as the aversive effects accompanying acute nicotine withdrawal and high nicotine doses. At the resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, medial and lateral aspects cannot be dissociated, and indeed, distinguishing habenula signals from those of the surrounding thalamus is difficult. However, regionally only the habenula responds to reward prediction, (non)reward outcomes, and performance feedback. For ease of presentation, below, we use the term habenula while acknowledging that the fMRI signal from such a small anatomical region may be contaminated by nonhabenula signals (e.g., other thalamic regions, physiologic noise).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6072, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The habenula is thought to play a critical role in the transition from positively reinforced, initial drug exposure to negatively reinforced, compulsive drug use and addiction. According to this perspective, repeated exposure to addictive drugs, including nicotine, is accompanied by increasingly elevated lateral habenula activity and the recruitment of medial habenula activity, which both contribute to the dysregulation of DAergic circuits. While drug use may initially decrease lateral habenula activity thereby contributing to the positive reinforcement of drug taking, as use continues, neuroadaptations occur potentially leading to elevated lateral habenula activity via allostatic processes. Elevated lateral habenula activity may contribute to an acute hypodopaminergic withdrawal state, and chronic drug use may then serve as a means to reduce this habenular hyperactivity. In addition, the medial habenula modulates nicotine-induced DA release and associated motivational processes in rodent models. Thus, elevated lateral habenula activity and the growing involvement of the medial habenula are thought to disproportionally prioritize nicotine rewards over other rewards.

As current pharmacologic smoking cessation aids are only modestly effective, elucidating the impact of early nicotine withdrawal and pharmacotherapy administration on the activity of these brain regions may facilitate identification of neurobiological targets for improved interventions. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline are two modestly efficacious and currently available pharmacologic cessation aids. Whereas nicotine is regarded as a full agonist at \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs, varenicline is regarded as a partial agonist at these receptors. In the context of a pharmacologic fMRI study, we collected neuroimaging data from biochemically verified overnight abstinent smokers and nonsmokers (table S1) while they completed a performance feedback task following administration of nicotine, varenicline, neither, or both. This experimental design allowed us to dissociate functional brain alterations associated with a chronic smoking history (smokers versus nonsmokers) from those associated with pharmacologic administration (nicotine and varenicline). We addressed three main empirical questions involving task effects, group effects, and drug effects. Regarding task effects, we expected brain activity patterns associated with the performance feedback task to replicate findings from the original implementation, specifically increased habenula, ACC, and insula activity following negative feedback and increased ventral striatal activity following positive feedback. Regarding group effects, we expected that smokers (versus nonsmokers) would display decreased striatal activity to positive feedback, indicative of neuroplastic changes associated with chronic nicotine exposure. Last, regarding drug effects, we expected that nicotine and varenicline administration would modify acute withdrawal-induced activity in the habenula and other regions associated with processing performance feedback (i.e., positive and/or negative outcomes) among smokers, but not nonsmokers (who were, of course, not in the state of nicotine withdrawal).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9846, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To these ends, we collected self-report questionnaire, behavioral task performance, and MRI data from participants in the context of a within-participant, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, involving two drugs: transdermal nicotine (NicoDerm CQ, GlaxoSmithKline) and oral varenicline (Chantix, Pfizer). Overnight abstinent smokers (~14 hours) and nonsmokers both completed six fMRI visits on different days over a 6- to 8-week study period (Fig. 1A).

This finding is consistent with accumulating neuroimaging evidence suggesting that dysregulated reward processing among chronic smokers is mediated by neuroadaptations (and/or preexisting vulnerabilities) within the striatum that manifest as both hypersensitivity to drug-related reward (e.g., cues) and hyposensitivity to monetary rewards. Another noteworthy aspect of this study is that the current task used nonmonetary feedback (i.e., emojis) to inform participants about trial outcomes, thereby speaking to the generalizability of striatal dysfunction beyond the anticipation and receipt of monetary rewards. Critically, smokers\u2019 blunted striatal responses to positive feedback were not altered by nicotine or varenicline, but rather were correlated with addiction severity (FTND) scores. This relationship between blunted striatal activity and increased trait levels of addiction severity is largely consistent with our previous observations within the same experimental design, but using a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task to probe MCL circuitry. In that report, we observed hypoactivation within the bilateral dorsal striatum and dorsal ACC (dACC) following the receipt of monetary rewards among abstinent smokers versus nonsmokers, a deficit that was more pronounced with increasing FTND scores. Although speculative, we suggest that the ventral (current report) versus dorsal [previous report ] distinction may reflect differences in the cognitive demands of the tasks used and the dissociation of dorsal striatal circuitry associated with goal-directed learning from ventral striatal circuitry associated with goal-directed performance. More specifically, the PRL task involved learning when to change one\u2019s behavior versus when to maintain a previous behavior, thereby probing dorsal striatal functioning, whereas the current performance feedback task involved less of a learning component and thereby served more as a probe of ventral striatal functioning. Moving beyond activity within circumscribed regions, additional evidence also implicates the functional connectivity between the striatum and dACC as similarly reflecting addiction severity. Hence, we have previously proposed that altered activity within the striatum and/or its functional connectivity with the dACC is linked with trait-level addiction severity as such brain measures are correlated with FTND scores and are not affected by acute nAChR agonist administration.

Whereas positive reinforcement relates to learning via the receipt of outcomes engendering a positive state (rewards), negative reinforcement relates to learning via the alleviation of outcomes engendering a negative state (removal of aversive stimuli). In the context of abstinent cigarette smokers, these negative states may include aversive nicotine withdrawal symptoms, including tobacco craving, anhedonia, irritability, and deficits in brain systems linked with reward processing.

From a different perspective, acute nicotine abstinence was associated with up-regulated habenula activity. Whereas DA neurons increase firing to stimuli predicting positive outcomes and are inhibited by stimuli predicting negative outcomes, habenula neurons show the opposite pattern and increase firing to negative outcome\u2013predicting stimuli and decrease firing to positive outcome\u2013predicting stimuli. We speculate that up-regulated habenula activity during acute abstinence may contribute to at least two commonly reported withdrawal symptoms, namely, irritability and anhedonia. Operationalizing irritability as enhanced responsivity to negative outcomes, increased habenula activity following negative feedback may be a neurobiological manifestation of this withdrawal symptom. Such a perspective is consistent with the habenula being a critical component of error-related neurocircuitry. Operationalizing anhedonia as attenuated responsivity to a positive outcome, increased habenula activity following positive feedback may, in part, contribute to a hypodopaminergic state and anhedonia. When considering all participants, we observed a positive correlation between greater habenula activity following positive feedback and higher state levels of self-reported social anhedonia.

First, the small size of the habenula [~30 mm3; (52)] generally limits its assessment in human fMRI studies using \u201cstandard\u201d echo-planar imaging (EPI) protocols (e.g., resampled 3-mm isotropic voxels). Given individual variation in habenula locations even after normalization to standard space, smoothing of functional data was a necessary step for voxel-wise group-level analyses. Although we applied a minimal amount of spatial smoothing [smoothed to 7-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM)], given the habenula\u2019s small size, we cannot rule out the possibility that signals within the anatomical habenula were potentially contaminated by signals from surrounding regions/structures. That said, the regions immediately adjacent to the habenula that, because of partial volume effects, could have contributed to the signal measured (e.g., mediodorsal thalamus) are not known to have functional properties consistent with that identified for the habenula in preclinical models. Related, given the habenula\u2019s adjacency to the ventricles, the BOLD signal in this location may be susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., pulsation and respiration), which are a source of noise in fMRI data. While we did not collect peripheral recordings of heart rate or respiration to minimize the already high participant burden of this study, we acknowledge that the inclusion of these measures as regressors of no interest could potentially improve assessments of this region. Continued improvements in equipment hardware and continued development of open-source toolboxes will increase the more widespread adoption of physiological noise reduction. These limitations may be at least partially circumvented using higher-resolution imaging techniques achieved at 7 T or at 3 T yielding voxel resolution in the 1- to 2-mm isotropic range as well as enhanced preprocessing for physiological noise reduction. Second, we acknowledge the functional specialization of the medial and lateral subdivisions of the habenula identified in preclinical work such that medial aspects having higher densities of nAChRs have been primarily linked with aversive responses to high nicotine doses and the lateral habenula having been primarily linked with reward processing, aversive stimuli, and emotions. However, given the resolution of our fMRI data, we are not able to speak to these subregional implications. Third, to ensure sufficient power needed to detect higher-level group and drug effects on task-based brain activity, we used a small volume\u2013corrected mask based on a priori hypotheses of brain regions implicated in nicotine withdrawal. However, group and drug effects in brain regions extending outside of our a priori mask may provide additional insight into neurobiological processes relevant to smoking-related behaviors.

This task feature was intended to induce participant uncertainty about trial performance until feedback delivery (i.e., to mitigate the self-detection of errors). While the dynamic difficulty manipulation was intended to consistently maintain error rates across participants and across the six neuroimaging visits, one behavioral aspect not under the control of the task\u2019s adaptive algorithm was the number of no-response trials (errors of omission), which reflect momentary lapses of attention. For each no-response trial encountered, the adaptive algorithm reduced the targeted number of correct trials by one. Hence, the percent values of no-response and correct trials were inversely related, demonstrated more variability across participants and sessions than that for error trials, and thus provided a convenient behavioral metric to assess group- and drug-related effects on these two dependent variables, which we interpreted as gross behavioral measures of attention. Given that the percent of no-response and correct trials were \u201cmirror images\u201d of each other, only no-response trial results are presented.
