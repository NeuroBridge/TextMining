Briefly, MDMR tests every voxel to determine if whole-brain connectivity to that voxel is more similar in individuals with similar MSCEIT score than in individuals with dissimilar MSCEIT score. As previously described, this analysis occurs in several stages: First, a seed-to-voxel connectivity map is generated by using an individual voxel\u2019s BOLD signal time-course to calculate the temporal Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between that voxel and all other gray matter voxels(Figure 1B). These maps are generated for every participant. In the second stage, the temporal correlation coefficients for each voxel in the connectivity map is correlated with the values of corresponding voxels in maps generated from every other participant. This Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, r is a measure of the similarity of whole-brain connectivity to that voxel between patients. This value is used to calculate between-subject distance (or dissimilarity) using the metric  where i and j are two subjects and r is the correlation coefficient above. (Figure 1C). The next stage tests the relationship between a given variable (here MSCEIT score) and the inter-subject distances in connectivity generated in the previous stage. Broadly speaking, this process consists of ANOVA-like hypothesis testing where the tested relationship is between a variable of interest and a matrix of distances. This process was originally termed multivariate distance matrix regression by Zapala and Schork and used to test associations between gene expression and related variables. Shezhad et al. then used their framework for testing the relationship between variables of interest and a matrix of distances where the matrix is between-subject similarity in whole-brain functional connectivity. This test consists of first forming a distance matrix  among n participants where d = the between subject distance metric calculated above. Next, this matrix is used to create a Gower\u2019s centered matrix , in which n is the number of participants, I is the n \u00d7 n identity matrix, and 1 is a vector of n 1s. The F statistic for assessing the relationship between a predictor variable (e.g. MSCEIT score) and dissimilarities in connectivity is calculated as follows: For m predictor variables, let X be a n\u00d7 m design matrix of predictor values, and let H = X(XT X)\u22121 XT be the associated n \u00d7 m \u201chat\u201d matrix.  (Figure 1D). This process is repeated for every voxel. The result is a whole brain map of how significantly MSCEIT scores are related to functional connectivity at every voxel (Figure 1E). From that map, ROIs for follow-up analysis are defined based on clusters of significant voxelwise F-statistics. To correct for multiple comparisons, a nonparametric permutation was calculated for voxels that exceeded the significance threshold of p < 0.001 and clusters of such with an extent threshold of p < 0.05, with a null distribution calculated from 5000 such permutations (Figure 1F). Scanner site was included as a covariate in this analysis. The voxelwise threshold was selected to maximize the likelihood of replicability.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15422, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This analysis identifies anatomical regions where MSCEIT score is significantly related to functional connectivity. Recall that at each brain voxel MDMR calculates a distance metric r between subjects by first calculating the temporal correlation in BOLD signal between that voxel and every other brain voxel. The generated set of temporal correlations is then correlated with the analogous set of temporal correlations from a different subject. The resulting between-subject correlation determines a distance metric that is a measure of between-subject similarity (or dissimilarity) in terms of functional connectivity at that voxel. Notably, this process disregards spatial information about the voxels that gave rise to between-individual distances e.g. Two individuals may be very distant (dissimilar) in the functional connectivity of a voxel in the precuneus, but is their dissimilarity driven by differences in precuneus connectivity to the mPFC or temporal lobe or parietal lobe or all of the above? MDMR as implemented by Shehzad et al. does not display this information. To visualize this spatial information requires follow-on seed-based connectivity analysis. Shehzad et al. and others have termed this follow-on analysis \u2018post-hoc\u2019 testing to make clear that this should not be considered independent hypothesis testing nor should it be considered independent validation of the original MDMR finding.

A separate field of inquiry has identified functional connectivity correlates of cognitive abilities such as sustained attention, fluid intelligence and a variety of behavioral traits. Until recently, the contribution of individual network topology to cognitive variation has been undetermined but a recent report has linked DMN topology to several cognitive and behavioral phenotypes.

More generally, the implications of this result extend beyond imaging studies of social cognition. The demonstration that individual brain network topology is associated with individual variation in complex cognition reinforces a growing appreciation of the limitations of group-based averaging in resting-state imaging. Averaging across groups of subjects likely obfuscates relationships between individual network topology and cognitive and behavioral phenotypes. In this example, the relationship between network topology and cognitive measures was significant enough to be discerned in a group of a hundred subjects scanned a single time each. It seems inevitable that other relationships between network topology and cognition / behavior remain to be discovered but discerning those relationships may likely require \u201cdense\u201d scanning of individual subjects i.e. scanning the same individuals five, twelve, or twenty-four times. Such efforts are resource intensive, but if such deep characterization yields greater understanding of network-behavior relationships, it is reasonable to imagine a re-allocation of resources away from participant numbers and towards precise network mapping.
