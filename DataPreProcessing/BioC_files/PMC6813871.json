The first is that the connectome is more modular in schizophrenia. An early version of this theory was proposed by Hoffman and McGlashan, who modeled the effects of excessive pruning in neural network simulations. They concluded that the resulting fragmentation of the brain network gives rise to functionally autonomous modules that act as \u2018parasitic foci\u2019 that repeatedly introduce the same output into the brain\u2019s information flow, which may underlie auditory hallucinations or delusions of control.  The second hypothesis, first articulated in a critique of Hoffman and McGlashan\u2019s work, argues that the brain\u2019s network is less modular in schizophrenia.  A less modular network could result in reduced information encapsulation and \u201coverflow\u201d of neural information from e.g., language into perceptual systems, and thereby invoke symptoms such as thought insertion and auditory hallucinations. Empirical evidence appears to favor the first theory, with a functional connectivity study showing more and smaller modules in schizophrenia patients  and two structural connectome studies showing higher modularity in schizophrenia and CHR.  In contrast, a study showing reduced modularity of functional brain networks in childhood-onset schizophrenia is more in line with the second theory.  Our current findings and previous results  add a third possibility. Namely, that the brain is not just more or less modular, but that there is a qualitative reorganization of the brain\u2019s modular organization in schizophrenia, resulting in abnormal functional interaction patterns between a range of brain regions, which may contribute to psychotic and cognitive symptom development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20096, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finding abnormalities in modular connectome organization before the onset of psychosis suggests that a maladaptive reorganization in the modular topology of the functional connectome may take place in the months to years preceding the first psychotic episode. In typical brain development, the maturation of different functional systems occurs at different times in the course of development, with e.g., sensorimotor networks maturing before those mediating higher cognitive functions.  Adolescent behaviors such as impulsivity and risk taking have been attributed to the asynchronous maturation of limbic and prefrontal systems, giving rise to heightened sensitivity to motivational cues in the context of immature cognitive control.  This critical window of limbic and cognitive system development and high sensitivity to socio-environmental inputs may represent a window of vulnerability for youth at risk for psychosis. Any deviation from the process of modular reorganization during this developmental window could give rise to complex patterns of hypo- and hyper-connectivity between brain regions, as have been observed in schizophrenia patients.  These aberrant functional connectivity patterns could have a particularly profound and lasting impact on the brain\u2019s functional organization and may contribute to psychotic symptom development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21445, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While the global modular organization of the brain was the main focus of our study, we note that the brain regions showing region-wise changes in modular assignment were regions that are commonly associated with schizophrenia.

These regions are among the most consistently implicated brain regions in early-course schizophrenia.  Examining modular network organization across levels of network resolution also indicated a change in modular assignment of STG from the sensorimotor to the limbic module. Intriguingly, a separation of STG from the larger somatosensory community was recently reported in a study of modular brain organization in schizophrenia.  Other consistent abnormalities across resolutions included changes in the modular assignment of orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and insula, in line with recent findings of salience module abnormalities in at-risk individuals.  Moreover, the latter study reported visual areas to extend into the limbic module.  Both our current and previous investigations in at-risk youth thus find primary sensory regions to become embedded in the limbic system in prodromal psychosis. These findings may fit in with theoretical models attributing psychotic symptoms to aberrant memory activations or the attribution of erroneous salience to the internal representation of a percept or memory.  Moreover, findings in schizophrenia patients indicate that the most prominent break-up of functional modules involves sensory, auditory, and visual areas.

First, physiological and head motion artifacts are known to influence fMRI-derived measures of functional connectivity.  To deal with these issues, we used the anatomical CompCor (aCompCor) method  for physiological noise reduction and the Artifact Detection Tool (art) for efficient rejection of motion and artefactual time points.  Second, a much-debated issue in the context of functional connectivity is the biological validity of negative, or anti-correlations.  A recent study indicates that when physiological and other noise sources are effectively removed, anti-correlations are present in the absence of global signal regression, suggesting a biological origin.  We therefore chose to include both positively and negatively weighted connectome edges. A third and related issue is the application of thresholds in functional network analyses. In graph theoretical studies, thresholds are commonly applied to obtain a more sparsely connected representation of the functional connectome. Even when the network is examined over a range of different thresholds, the impact of imposing a threshold on the resulting graph metrics is non-trivial. Moreover, thresholding typically removes negative correlations, thereby discarding neurobiologically relevant information.  To avoid these limitations, we used a community detection method equipped to deal with fully weighted networks including both positive and negative edge weights.  Lastly, the changes in functional connectome organization observed in our study may indicate abnormalities in synchronous neural activity and modular interactions. However, given the indirect and correlational nature of functional connectivity measurements derived from resting-state fMRI, we cannot rule out the possibility that non-neural factors including hemodynamic response function variability  may have influenced our results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25333, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This study finds that the modular organization of the functional connectome is abnormal in CHR youth that go on to develop a psychotic episode, but not in CHRs that do not develop psychosis.
