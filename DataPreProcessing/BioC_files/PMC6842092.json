A key advantage of RS-fMRI is that it can be used to assess distributed neural networks rather than brain regions in isolation. The striatum is a key node within cortico-striatal loops, or functional networks composed of cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. RS-fMRI studies have reliably identified five cortico-striatal networks: the fronto-parietal (FPN), default mode (DMN), limbic (LN), salience (SAL), and motor networks. RS-fMRI studies of cortico-striatal networks in psychotic disorders have not reached a consensus regarding the nature of dysconnectivity in these five cortico-striatal networks. Research consistently finds decreased FPN connectivity [e.g., involved in goal representation ] in psychotic disorders. Research also generally implicates decreased salience network connectivity [e.g., information integration, salience attribution ] in psychotic disorders. Research also finds hyper-connectivity in motor networks [e.g., execution of motor plans ], although the direction of connectivity in the DMN [e.g., attention to internal states, self-referential thinking ] and limbic (e.g., motivation) networks is mixed. Furthermore, there is a lack of consistency regarding the associations between cortico-striatal connectivity, clinical symptoms, and impaired cognition. In terms of associations between cortico-striatal connectivity and symptoms, recent research indicates that salience network hypo-connectivity is correlated with impaired cognition and positive psychotic symptoms. However, other networks, such as the FPN and DMN, have also been linked to positive symptoms.

Furthermore, we replicated previous findings of SAL network hypo-connectivity, as the voxel-wise analysis helped localize the SAL network connectivity differences to the putamen. The SAL network is consistently linked to functions associated with impairment in psychotic disorders, including directing attention towards important stimuli, making the SAL network a likely suspect for impaired connectivity across psychotic disorders. SAL-related dysfunction in psychotic disorders has been found in neuroimaging studies, including reductions in gray-matter volume in SAL regions, impairments in task-related activation, as well as altered structural connectivity in key SAL regions. Likewise, and consistent with this study, reduced SAL connectivity in psychotic disorders has been found in a number of studies, including reduced connectivity within the insula, dorsal ACC, as well as overall reduced SAL within-network connectivity. Lastly, post-hoc analyses indicated that FPN and LN networks showed reduced connectivity specifically for the schizophrenia group, replicating findings from previous cortico-striatal connectivity work. Thus, while the SAL network exhibited transdiagnostic connectivity impairments across psychotic disorders, the FPN and LN connectivity impairments were unique to schizophrenia. The post-hoc findings of cortical seed-based impairments in the FPN and LN networks in this group indicate that there are connectivity impairments that perhaps represent more proximal risk factors unique to the diagnosis of schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27559, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "With regard to striatal connectivity to cortical regions, the vrPT seeds showed reduced connectivity to the medial prefrontal cortex. This hypo-connectivity between the ventrorostal putamen and a salience network portion of the medial PFC is consistent with the current study\u2019s cortical seed-based findings of salience network hypo-connectivity and provides further evidence that salience network dysfunction is specifically associated with transdiagnostic impairment across psychotic disorders. This medial PFC hypo-connectivity is also consistent with several studies finding that hypo-connectivity of this region linked to self-referential thinking is associated with schizophrenia spectrum symptoms. Furthermore, the vrPT hypo-connectivity extended into the anterior cingulate cortex, a region that has been heavily implicated in psychotic disorders, including recent research indicating that increased connectivity between the ACC and putamen is associated with more favorable treatment response.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28561, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Hypo-connectivity in SAL network regions in both the cortical and striatum seed-based analyses is also consistent with the dopamine hypothesis of psychotic disorders. As noted in the Introduction, hyper-dopaminergic functioning is heavily implicated in psychosis and the dopaminergic system is also broadly implicated in cortico-striatal circuits. The dopaminergic system likely has multiple influences on the development and expression of psychotic symptoms, including influencing salience misattribution and failures in information integration, functions associations with reduced SAL connectivity. Such a model could, if supported by future studies designed to test it explicitly, unify behavioral, functional, and neural correlates of psychotic symptoms. However, inconsistent with previous research and perhaps the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis, we did not replicate previous correlations between SAL connectivity (or vrPT-mPFC connectivity) and cognition and positive symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29548, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our investigation has several limitations. First of all, it is unclear if the functional dysconnectivity found in the current study is a consequence of compromised structural connectivity, as has been reported in previous studies. Multi-modal investigations will be helpful in clarifying the nature of cortico-striatal dysconnectivity. Second, the relatively small number of psychotic bipolar patients (n=40) included in our sample is another limitation. Third, the schizophrenia sample was quite heterogeneous (i.e., 42.7% first episode, 6.2% schizoaffective). Future research should replicate these transdiagnostic effects in other homogeneous psychotic samples (e.g., first-episode, medication na\u00efve) to examine the generalizability of results. Lastly, somewhat surprising, the cortical pattern of connectivity for each of the putamen seeds (i.e., dcPT, drPT, and vrPT) were very similar (see Figure 3), and therefore it will be important for future research to replicate these patterns of cortico-striatal connectivity using other striatum parcellations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30607, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, using a combination of cortical and striatal seed-based approaches, we confirmed that SAL network hypo-connectivity is present in both schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder, perhaps representing a transdiagnostic biomarker.
