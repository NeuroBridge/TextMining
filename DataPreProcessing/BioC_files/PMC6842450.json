First, de novo mCCA+jICA was a data-driven explorative analysis and must be interpreted with caution. However, given similarity between a priori ICs and the present results, the differences across datasets provide intriguing possibilities for further hypothesis-driven study. Second, the present cognitive control metric was not identical to the HCP metric due to study design differences, potentially limiting our ability to detect all of the same relationships identified in our prior work (see supplement). Third, while IC3 was group discriminative overall, we were unable to detect significant post-hoc differences between HC and BP, though differences between HC and SZ were significant and differences between SZ and BP were trend-level, which may be due to medications or a relatively unimpaired BP group. Fourth, it was surprising that a priori HCP_gC1_IC3 rsfcMRI did not significantly predict cognitive control in the entire psychosis sample or any of the individual subgroups. This could be due to differences in the behavioral composite across the studies or, alternatively, it is possible that sum of numerous small but subtle differences in the two maps were sufficient to reduce predictive performance. Finally, sample size may have limited our ability to detect group discrimination of a priori ICs, relationships between imaging and cognitive control given that we only had behavioral data for 30 HC, 27 BP, and 23 SZ participants. However, the de novo identification of IC3 which was 91.5% similar to HCP_gC1_IC3 suggests that this pattern is indeed a durable feature in the data and that limited variance in the cognitive control composite was the primary driver of our inability to detect some effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29063, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, the present study employed multimodal methods to examine transdiagnostic alterations in cognitive control in psychosis. Two modalities from a priori ICs from the normative population significantly predicted cognitive control in psychosis for two of six modalities tested. De novo mCCA+jICA identified a group-discriminative IC that significantly correlated with cognitive control for sMRI, rsfcMRI, and tfMRI data. De novo analyses suggest joint associations between cognitive control and tfMRI contributions from the posterior frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual networks, sMRI contributions from the insula, medial PFC, and cingulate, and rsfcMRI contributions from canonical resting-state network organization. However, significant effects were predominantly driven by SZ with little evidence for effects in BP or HC. Given psychotic symptom heterogeneity in BP, results suggest that shared symptomatology, e.g. psychosis, may be key to identification of transdiagnostic relationships with cognitive control. Together, these results identified significant and replicable relationships across modalities and the psychosis spectrum, providing targets across modalities of neural structure and function for future research.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30311, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30334, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Disclosures:", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30347, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "SK, VDC, and DTM have no biomedical financial interests or potential conflicts of interest.
