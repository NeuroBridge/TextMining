The specificity of the deprivation-enhancement to positive neural prediction error signals during loss-avoidance appears to parallel clinical descriptions of addiction as a cycle maintained by negative reinforcement wherein drug-deprived dependent individuals seek drugs and thus successfully avoid negative states (e.g., withdrawal, isolation etc.); such successful loss-avoidance has been posited to reinforce continued drug seeking (for relevant discussions see).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23554, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These data are consonant with prior studies showing that with greater chronicity of cocaine use, physiological adaptations occur in DA systems. In particular, the enhanced neural positive prediction error (\u03b4+) encoding in C- relative to C+ cocaine dependent participants is consistent with studies showing that long term cocaine dependent humans have decreased density of striatal DA receptors and lower tonic DA levels and that acute cocaine intake in chronically cocaine-treated mice reduces DA signaling. Following from these studies, \u03b4+ signals ought to be more evident during drug deprivation (as observed here) than during drug use, as DA receptors, though diminished in density, are free in the deprived state to detect \u03b4+ fluctuations. We note that in the present cocaine dependent participants, neural \u03b4+ responses in the drug-deprived state are comparable with the \u03b4+ observed in non-psychiatric control participants, whereas \u03b4+ signaling in the drug-using state was diminished relative to the control participants. Together these data suggest that although learning signal impairments appear restored by cocaine deprivation in dependent participants, such intact learning can have increasingly detrimental consequences in the context of unhealthy reinforcers, negative environmental states, and adverse outcomes (e.g., when dependent individuals are faced with withdrawal avoidance, drug-available environments, and drug-use).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24992, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present data are also relevant for closely related reports of significant increase in prediction error correlates following DA agonist administration and computational model based theories that drug use exacerbates prediction errors or triggers \u2018false\u2019 phasic activation of DA neurons. A key difference between these previous reports and the present findings is the incorporation of the consequences of long-term drug dependence (i.e., diminished DA functioning) into an understanding of learning in addiction. In addition, the present diminished \u03b4+ signaling in C+ and enhancement in C- individuals is consistent with related work showing DA drug-state modulation of learning signals in participants with Parkinson\u2019s disease (who are known to have impaired DA function); these participants similarly show reduced prediction error-related BOLD responses when on DA enhancing medication (levodopa) and greater prediction error responses while off medication, specifically to positive prediction errors (\u03b4+; ).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26005, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, we show that greater neural loss-learning \u03b4+ (signaling successful loss-avoidance) during deprivation mediates a relationship between chronicity of drug use and desire for cocaine.

The present data thus emphasize that both drug-use chronicity and the context in which learning is assessed (e.g., loss, gain, etc.) may be critical for identifying neurobehavioral mechanisms that maintain drug use (for related data indicating differences in neural substrates of loss and gain learning, see).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26627, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The limitations of the current work provide avenues for further study. First, a relatively small number of male participants were included in this study (N = 22). While the within-subjects design and advantages of sample homogeneity partially mitigate the sample size, replication in a larger, more diverse sample would address questions regarding generalizability. In addition, the present study identified drug-state modulation of responses to negative outcomes but does not evaluate the degree to which the physical consequences per se (i.e., small or large monetary loss), affect associated with the consequences, or other aspect of the outcomes, contribute to the reinforcement provided by successful loss avoidance. Clarifying the role of components of negative outcomes in maintaining substance use in dependence ought to be a focus of future studies. Finally, we focused our neural analyses primarily on regions of striatum, given previous work linking learning mechanisms and cocaine pharmacodynamics to these regions. Supplemental analyses found no effects of cocaine-state on encoding of expected value (see Figure S2B), indicating generally intact outcome valuation unaffected by drug use status; nonetheless, other neural regions implicated in learning may be of interest in future investigations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27938, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, in cocaine dependent participants, we show that drug deprivation enhances neural signaling of successful loss avoidance, which in turn predicts increased desire to use cocaine. The deprivation-enhanced neural prediction error is in-line with prior reports of DA adaptations associated with chronic substance use and also points to a potential mechanism via which drug seeking is maintained. That is, when dependent individuals are at their most vulnerable (i.e., during drug deprivation), reward signals associated with successful avoidance of negative states are at their greatest and may contribute to a pernicious cycle of drug seeking in the face of quit attempts. Of note, DA dysregulation has been associated with poor response to behavioral treatments in addiction and innovative behavioral training protocols have identified learning systems as potential new mechanistic treatment targets for cocaine dependence. More generally, the current results support targeting learning-based therapies to identify goal driven behaviors that provide relief from the negative outcomes of drug deprivation and indicate that attention to drug state may be critical for understanding neural mechanisms of addiction and refining learning-based therapies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29197, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29220, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Financial Disclosures", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29242, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The authors report no biomedical financial interests or potential conflicts of interest.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29331, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

Participants completed trials until learning occurred or up to 36 trials per block. B) The reinforcement learning model incorporated positive and negative prediction errors (\u03b4+ and \u03b4-, respectively) which updated the subsequent expected value (Q) with separately estimated learning rates (\u03b1+ and x- respectively). Trial-by-trial prediction errors are computed as the difference between the outcome and expected value (R - Q). C) The model predicted probability of selecting the better option was a good fit with both C- and C+ participants\u2019 actual behavior (% better option selected across subjects).

F) To clarify whether the drug-state modulation of \u03b1+ and/or \u03b2 was associated with the cocaine- state differences in model-free behavioral performance (panel d), we simulated behavioral choices iterating through the observed ranges of \u03b1+ and \u03b2 parameter values and show that increasing \u03b1+ was associated with diminished total earnings, while performance did not vary with changes in \u03b2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35676, "infons": {"file": "nihms-1509035-f0002.jpg", "id": "F2", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_title_caption"}, "text": "Cocaine-use status modulates neural learning signals and reveals increased positive prediction error signaling during deprivation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35807, "infons": {"file": "nihms-1509035-f0002.jpg", "id": "F2", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "A) Positive prediction error signal (\u03b4+) was found in the right striatum for cocaine-deprived participants (C-; peak voxel at T = 5.33; cluster FWE corrected p = 0.005; thresholded at T = 2.9 for visualization, see Table S2A). No significant neural \u03b4+ signals were found for participants using cocaine as usual (C+). Neither C- nor C+ participants showed significant neural responses to negative prediction errors (\u03b4-). See also Figure S2A and Table S2D for C- > C+ contrasts that further show \u2018deprivation- enhancement\u2019 of learning signals.
