However, approximately one-third of patients do not benefit from ECT in the clinic. Thus, it is critical to investigate differences between ECT responders and non-responders. Accumulated evidence has indicated that one region of ECT action is the hippocampus, which also plays an important role in SZ pathophysiology. To date, no studies have investigated differences in ECT effects in the hippocampus between treatment responders and non-responders. This study recruited twenty-one SZ patients treated for four weeks with ECT (MSZ, n\u202f=\u202f21) and twenty-one SZ patients who received pharmaceutical therapy (DSZ, n\u202f=\u202f21). The MSZ group was further categorized into responders (MSR, n\u202f=\u202f10) or non-responders (MNR, n\u202f=\u202f11) based on treatment outcomes by the criterion of a 50% reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores. Using structural and resting-state functional MRI, we measured the hippocampal volume and functional connectivity (FC) in all SZ patients (before and after treatment) and 23 healthy controls. In contrast to pharmaceutical therapy, ECT induced bilateral hippocampal volume increases in the MSZ. Both the MSR and MNR exhibited hippocampal expansion after ECT, whereas a lower baseline volume in one of hippocampal subfield (hippocampus-amygdala transition area) was found in the MNR. After ECT, increased FC between the hippocampus and brain networks associated with cognitive function was only observed in the MSR. The mechanism of action of ECT in schizophrenia is complex. A combination of baseline impairment level, ECT-introduced morphological changes and post-ECT FC increases in the hippocampus may jointly contribute to the post-ECT symptom improvements in patients with SZ.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2335, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2348, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a serious mental disorder mainly characterized by multidimensional psychotic syndrome, such as positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive and affective impairments.

ECT-related neuroplasticity is one of the potential mechanisms, especially neuroplasticity occurring in the hippocampus. Several studies found reproducible results that electroconvulsive shock induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in an animal model. In humans, accumulated evidence has also indicated that ECT induced volume increases in the hippocampus. More recently, Takamiy and colleagues systematically reviewed MRI studies investigating structural changes due to ECT in patients with depression and quantitatively analysed whether ECT induced hippocampal and other brain region structural changes through a meta-analytic approach. They found that both right and left hippocampal and amygdalar volumes increased after ECT. In addition, our previous study applied a data-driven method (voxel-based morphometry, VBM) to detect ECT-induced grey-matter alterations across the whole brain and found significant grey matter increases within the hippocampus. Although some studies have also reported ECT-induced changes in other regions, such as the striatum, cingulate cortex and insula, the current hypothesis-driven study focused on ECT-induced hippocampal plasticity, compared hippocampal volume and FC between ECT responders and non-responders to link ECT-related hippocampal plasticity with clinical outcomes in SZ.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4397, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The hippocampus anatomically connects brain regions that mediate emotional and cognitive regulation, which supports the hippocampus as having a key role in SZ-related circuitry. In addition, structural and functional disruptions in the hippocampus have been implicated in the pathophysiology of SZ. On the one hand, hippocampal volume reduction has been widely reported in previous SZ studies. However, several structural MRI studies have reported contrasting results with no differences in hippocampal volume between SZ and healthy subjects. These inconsistencies might be explained by illness duration or treatment strategy. As there are these inconsistent results regarding the hippocampal volume reductions in SZ, it is meaningful for clinical research to clarify the relationship between the levels of hippocampal volume reduction and clinical responses to ECT. A substantial number of studies have indicated that there are FC alterations in the hippocampus in patients with SZ. Moreover, studies have found associations between hippocampal FC changes and clinical symptoms in SZ patients. These findings not only suggest that hippocampal FC is highly relevant to the symptoms and pathobiology of SZ but also imply that clinical treatment outcomes (e.g., symptom remission) may be directly reflected in FC changes. However, to date, no study has investigated whether ECT causes differential FC changes in the hippocampus between responders and non-responders and assessed the relationship between FC changes and symptom remission.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5933, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Clinically, approximately one-third of patients do not benefit from ECT; thus, it is of high clinical significance to investigate differences between ECT responders and non-responders. Taking into account these issues, in this observational study, which was designed in a similar manner as a previous study, we systematically assessed ECT effects on hippocampal structure and function in patients with SZ. Our specific aims were to clarify (1) whether the hippocampal volume changes induced by ECT were different than those treated with drug treatment alone. We hypothesized that the hippocampal volume would be increased after ECT treatment but would not change after drug treatment alone; (2) whether the hippocampal volume increase is an ECT effect common to both clinical responders and non-responders.

(2) Both the MSR and MNR groups exhibited increased hippocampal volume following ECT, which further indicated that hippocampal volume increases were an inherent effect of ECT. (3) Interestingly, in the MSR group, we found increased FC between the hippocampus and higher-order cognitive networks; however, in the MNR group, we observed reduced FC between the hippocampus and primary sensory networks, including visual, sensorimotor and auditory networks. These findings suggested that ECT-induced changes in hippocampal FC with higher-order cognitive networks might be associated with clinical symptoms.

Our study revealed increased volumes in the bilateral hippocampus only in the ECT sample, whereas evidence for such structural changes was absent in the drug-only sample. Furthermore, the current study divided the ECT samples into MSR and MNR groups and observed a hippocampal volume increase common to both groups. This finding indicated that these changes in hippocampal volume induced by ECT were not unique to patients with improved symptoms. In this study, the ECT-related brain changes in the hippocampus observed in patients with SZ were similar to those observed in patients with MDD, which is consistent with previous studies. Thomann and colleagues reported a similar pattern of brain volume changes in the hippocampus of individuals with SZ and MDD. In addition, hippocampal deficits have frequently been reported to be robust in patients with SZ, and previous studies provided evidence that such abnormalities also exist in those with MDD. This suggests that ECT modulates neural effects that are not diagnosis-specific but are critical for both affective and non-affective psychoses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30791, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Accumulated evidence has indicated that SZ is related to aberrant functional interactions between large-scale brain networks and cortical-subcortical pathways. To date, several neuroimaging studies have investigated FC changes induced by ECT using resting-state fMRI. Abbott reported that hippocampal FC increased after ECT in MDD patients and correlated with depressive symptom reduction. Our recent study found increased functional integration in the DMN in patients with SZ following ECT using a data-driven FC density analysis. However, very few neuroimaging studies have addressed whether the brain FC affected by ECT differs between responders and non-responders. To our knowledge, only one study used baseline resting-state FC networks to predict ECT clinical responsiveness, although they did not investigate the longitudinal alterations that may have contributed to symptom improvement. These findings supported the hypothesis that FC networks are specifically altered in patients who respond to ECT. Interestingly, in the current study, we found increased FC between the hippocampus and higher-order cognitive networks, especially the default mode network (DMN), in the MSR group. The hippocampus is a key region for memory encoding and retrieval functions. The DMN has been widely implicated in self-referential processes related to internal mental states. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as an important region of the central executive network, is responsible for higher-order cognitive function and is crucial for interfacing with the external environment. A possible ECT mechanism could be reinforcing the connectivity between the hippocampus and higher-order cognitive networks to manage the information integration between the internal- and external-based mental landscapes and thus influence the clinical symptoms. In addition, an association between FC changes and symptom reductions was observed, which further demonstrated the relationship between ECT effects and clinical treatment outcomes. In addition, we found reduced FC between the hippocampus and primary sensory networks in the non-responders. Notably, after ECT, these so-called \"non-responders\" exhibited an incomplete remission relative to the \"responders\", rather than a worsening of clinical symptoms. These FC reductions may be another ECT mechanism that weakens the connectivity of the hippocampus and primary sensory networks to block access of the primary information and achieve mild symptom remission. In this manner, the lack of bottom-up primary information may give rise to abnormalities in higher-order information processing. Therefore, these patients failed to attain complete symptom remission. However, these interpretations are speculative; thus, future studies should test this hypothesis by task-based fMRI.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33603, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Baseline comparisons indicated that compared with the HCs, the SZ patients in the MSR and MNR groups showed lower hippocampal subfield volumes in the HATA.

To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting that a lower baseline hippocampal subfield volume correlated with poorer ECT outcomes. In addition, FC baseline comparisons also found higher hippocampus-putamen FC in the MNR group than in the MSR and HC groups. However, the baseline differences between responders and non-responders may have also been influenced by age, disease duration, episode duration, medication and other random factors. Thus, the baseline differences should be interpreted with caution.

Although we included a matched pharmacotherapy group as the treatment control, the effects of concomitant antipsychotics during the ECT course cannot be completely ruled out. Third, neuropsychological assessments were not evaluated; thus, we did not assess the associations between the changes in cognitive function and brain changes.
