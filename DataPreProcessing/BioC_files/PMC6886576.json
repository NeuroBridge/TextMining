While reports on the effects of cannabis on cognitive performance in patients with SCZ have been mixed, study of brain networks related to executive function may clarify the relationship between cannabis use and cognition in these dual-diagnosis patients. In the present pilot study, patients with SCZ and CUD (n=12) and healthy controls (n=12) completed two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting scans. Prior to the second scan, patients smoked a 3.6% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis cigarette or ingested a 15mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) pill. We used resting-state functional connectivity to examine the default mode network (DMN) during both scans, as connectivity/activity within this network is negatively correlated with connectivity of the network involved in executive control and shows reduced activity during task performance in normal individuals. At baseline, relative to controls, patients exhibited DMN hyperconnectivity that correlated with positive symptom severity, and reduced anticorrelation between the DMN and the executive control network (ECN). Cannabinoid administration reduced DMN hyperconnectivity and increased DMN-ECN anticorrelation. Moreover, the magnitude of anticorrelation in the controls, and in the patients after cannabinoid administration, positively correlated with WM performance.

Data were slice time corrected, realigned, coregistered, normalized, and spatially smoothed with a 6-mm kernel. To address the spurious correlations in resting-state networks caused by head motion we used quality assurance software Artifact Detection Tools (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn) to identify problematic time points during the scan. Specifically, an image was defined as an outlier if the head displacement in x, y, or z direction was greater than .5mm from the previous frame, or if the global mean intensity in the image was greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean image intensity for the entire resting scan. A single regressor for each outlier image was included in the first level general linear model along with motion parameters and first order derivatives. Physiological and other spurious sources of noise were estimated and regressed using the anatomical CompCor method (aCompCor) as opposed to global signal regression, a widely used preprocessing method known to artificially introduce negative correlations. The anatomical image for each participant was segmented into white matter, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) masks using SPM8. To minimize partial voluming with grey matter, the white matter and CSF masks were eroded by one voxel, which resulted in substantially smaller masks than the original segmentations. The eroded white matter and CSF masks were then used as noise regions of interest (ROI). Signals from the white matter and CSF noise ROIs were extracted from the unsmoothed functional volumes to avoid additional risk of contaminating white matter and CSF signals with grey matter signals. Previous results showed that aCompCor signals were considerably different from the global signal, as regressing higher order principal components of the global signal diminished both positive and negative correlations whereas regressing aCompCor signals resulted in stronger anticorrelations and eliminated spurious correlations. Based on previous results, five principal components of the signals from white matter and CSF noise ROIs were removed with regression. A temporal band-pass filter of 0.009 Hz to 0.08 Hz was applied to the time series. The residual BOLD time-series was band-pass filtered over a low-frequency window of interest (0.009Hz<f<0.08Hz). Correlation maps were produced by extracting the residual BOLD time course from seed regions based on the literature. The DMN seed was defined using a 10 mm sphere around peak MPFC coordinates, as specified in. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were then calculated between the DMN time course and the time course of all other voxels in the brain. Correlation coefficients were converted to normally distributed scores using Fisher\u2019s transformation to allow for second-level General Linear Model analyses.

While a significant difference between the effects of smoked cannabis and oral THC was not found in this pilot study, further research is needed to examine possible differential effects of cannabis and THC as well as dose dependent effects on network connectivity and symptomatology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25840, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These preliminary findings also indicated that cannabinoids significantly improve the DMN/ECN anticorrelation. By improving the strength of anticorrelation between these networks, low dose cannabis (or THC) may allow for more appropriate allocation of attentional resources, thus enhancing the ability to distinguish (and shift) between internal and external modes of processing. Although cannabinoid administration did not improve WM performance in this pilot study, after cannabinoid administration (but not before) we did observe a direct association between the strength of DMN/ECN anticorrelation and WM performance. In accordance with our findings, Loberg and colleagues found that patients with SCZ who used cannabis showed greater activation of the ECN and deactivation of the DMN during task performance than patients who did not use cannabis. In a previous study, we found a functional dissociation in the DMN pathology in patients with schizophrenia such that MPFC-PCC hyperconnectivity related to positive symptoms (and not working memory capacity) while MPFC-DLPFC anticorrelations related to working memory performance. In addition, there is vast evidence in the literature that DMN/ECN anticorrelations (e.g., MPFC-DLPFC anticorrelations) are related to executive function such as working memory capacity in typical adults. Specifically, the magnitude of resting state anticorrelation between DMN/ECN has been linked to superior cognitive control and working memory task performance. In the present study, we also found a direct association between the strength of the DMN/ECN anticorrelation and WM performance in healthy controls, consistent with prior study findings.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27526, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our findings have implications for establishing the applicability of resting state functional connectivity assessment for use as a measure of circuit-level alteration in inter-regional functional connectivity induced by pharmacologic agents.

Our data may have potential implications for the development of pharmacotherapies that can normalize circuit level function in patients with SCZ.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28106, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The results reported here should be interpreted in light of the study limitations. First, this is a pilot study; the small sample size is a significant limitation and results must be replicated in a larger patient sample. Second, this study did not include a SCZ without CUD subject group for comparison; such a group would be helpful in elucidating pathophysiological differences in SCZ versus \u2018dual disorder\u2019 patients. Third, our sample size was not large enough to distinguish possible differences between cannabis and THC; further investigation is necessary to expand upon these pilot results. Fourth, because all patients were being treated with antipsychotic medication, the possibility that findings may have been impacted by treatment cannot be ruled out. Similar abnormalities in DMN functional connectivity, however, have been observed in medication-naive patients as well as in first-degree relatives of patients with SCZ. Fifth, in the present study, a low dose of THC (3.6% within the smoked cannabis cigarette, or 15mg in the pill) was administered. This dose is lower than that often seen \u201con the streets,\u201d where THC percentages can be much higher. Higher doses of both cannabis and THC, however, might have worsened cognition and psychotic symptom severity that may have impacted the resting state connectivity results. Sixth, since others have demonstrated that nicotine withdrawal and craving is associated with alterations in the DMN function, future studies should control for levels of nicotine dependence and craving. Lastly, while the investigation of inter-network anticorrelations can provide valuable insight into impairment in intrinsic organization of brain networks in psychiatric patient populations, the introduction of false positives and reporting of spurious anticorrelations in resting state studies have been of particular concern. In the present study, however, physiological and other spurious sources of noise were estimated and regressed using the aCompCor method as opposed to global signal regression; doing so allowed interpretation of anticorrelations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30203, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30214, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this pilot investigation, DMN hyperconnectivity as well as impaired DMN/ECN anticorrelation was found in patients with SCZ and CUD relative to healthy control participants. Our findings shed light on the effects of cannabinoid administration and suggest that in patients with SCZ and CUD cannabinoids induce alterations in network connectivity of the DMN, and in functional coupling between the DMN and ECN that directly correlates with WM performance. Thus, cannabinoid administration restores circuit function in dual-diagnosis patients close to that seen in normal controls. While further research is needed to elaborate upon the effects of cannabis on functional connectivity of the DMN, plasticity of the DMN induced by cannabinoid administration implies that treatment efficacy could potentially be assessed through the ability to ameliorate underlying circuit-level dysfunction in patients with SCZ and CUD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31132, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
