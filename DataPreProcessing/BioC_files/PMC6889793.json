Previous research has shown reduced brain network efficiency in older children and adolescents with PAE, but no imaging studies have examined brain differences in young children with PAE, at an age when cognitive and behavioral problems often first become apparent. The present study aimed to investigate the brain's functional connectome in young children with PAE using passive viewing fMRI. We analyzed 34 datasets from 26 children with PAE aged 2\u20137 years and 215 datasets from 87 unexposed typically-developing children in the same age range. The whole brain functional connectome was constructed using functional connectivity analysis across 90 regions for each dataset. We examined intra- and inter-participant stability of the functional connectome, graph theoretical measurements, and their correlations with age. Children with PAE had similar inter- and intra-participant stability to controls. However, children with PAE, but not controls, showed increasing intra-participant stability with age, suggesting a lack of variability of intrinsic brain activity over time. Inter-participant stability increased with age in controls but not in children with PAE, indicating more variability of brain function across the PAE population. Global graph metrics were similar between children with PAE and controls, in line with previous studies in older children. This study characterizes the functional connectome in young children with PAE for the first time, suggesting that the increased brain variability seen in older children develops early in childhood, when participants with PAE fail to show the expected age-related increases in inter-individual stability.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2313, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2326, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can have difficulties with language, attention, learning, and behavior compared to unexposed children. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown brain alterations underlying these difficulties in children with PAE, including decreased total brain volume, increased and decreased cortical thickness, and altered white matter microstructure (lower fractional anisotropy and/or higher mean diffusivity). Functional MRI studies show that PAE is associated with altered functional connectivity at rest in infants, children and youth, and adults, as well as both increased and decreased functional connectivity within brain networks during working memory tasks. However, no MRI studies have examined brain functional connectivity in young children with PAE (i.e., 2\u20136 years).

This approach constructs a connectivity matrix representing brain regions and their structural or functional connections with each other, and then quantifies the topological features of this connectivity matrix, or graph. An increasing number of studies have investigated the development of the brain's functional connectome from infancy to adulthood. While functional brain abnormalities are evident in school-age children and youth with PAE, very little previous research has investigated how PAE alters the brain's functional connectome. One previous study showed reduced global efficiency and higher path length in youth aged 10\u201317 years with PAE compared to unexposed controls. A second study in a different sample (aged 7\u201317 years) found no differences in global brain metrics, but noted substantially more atypical values of global efficiency, clustering coefficient and characteristic path length in the PAE group than in controls. Functional connectome analysis has demonstrated whole brain network alterations in other neurodevelopmental disorders, and shows potential in clinical diagnosis and intervention.

Unlike resting state fMRI that requires participants to lie still for several minutes with minimalm stimulus, passive viewing fMRI allows participant to watch videos during their scan.

Several previous studies have successfully examined brain activity, variability, and/or network development using naturalistic-viewing fMRI, including in young children. Passive viewing fMRI has also been applied to young children and older adults with major depressive disorder and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we examined functional connectome measures including network efficiency and centrality, as well as inter- and intra-individual stability. We expected that young children with PAE would show decreased network efficiency and increased network path length compared to exposed controls, as seen in older childhood.

The high intra-participant stability in the PAE group was unexpected because children with PAE often have behavioral challenges, atypical neurocognitive responses to visual, auditory, and emotional stimuli, as well as altered functional connectivity among brain regions. It may be that movie viewing, as opposed to behavioral tasks, moderates the intra-individual variability in children with PAE and leads to higher stability.

Increasing intra-individual stability with age in children with PAE may reflect decreased variability in cognitive processing during passive viewing. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies have shown that signal variability increases with age from childhood to adulthood in typically-developing individuals, and that higher variability (i.e., decreased stability) is associated with better task performance. This suggests that variability in neuronal responses is essential to appropriate cognitive processing and the relative lack of variability may underlie impaired cognitive processing in children with PAE.

This may suggest that children with PAE have highly variable development rates, with some children showing faster brain development than others, perhaps associated with the extent of PAE. More similar development rates in controls would lead to increasing inter-individual stability, while more variable rates of brain development in children with PAE would keep inter-individual stability low relative to controls. Higher inter-individual variability in the human brain has been detected in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including adults with ASD and young adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. One study in older children with PAE showed more atypical functional connectome metrics in PAE compared to controls. For comparison purposes, we applied a similar analysis testing how many participants with PAE were >1 standard deviation from the mean of the whole sample. We found that 15% of the children with PAE in our study had atypical global functional connectome metrics (local and global efficiency, clustering coefficient and shortest path length), considerably lower than the 50% observed in older children and adolescents with PAE. Our current results showed greater inter-individual variability within the PAE group than in controls, and suggest divergent trajectories in the functional connectome, where stability across individuals increases with age in controls, but these increases are absent in individuals with PAE. This difference in development may be associated with the higher frequency of atypical functional connectomes in older children and adolescents with PAE. The lack of increasing inter-participant stability in the PAE group may reflect disordered functional network development that becomes more apparent with age as functional demand increases. Indeed, older children with PAE had altered functional brain network connectivity. The altered development of inter- and intra-individual stability may contribute to diverse cognitive impairments often observed in children with PAE.
