Here, the use of opiates, such as heroin, morphine, or opium, leads to a clinically significant impairment in controlling intake and maintaining glutamate homeostasis. Although there are existing theories to explain the underpinnings of the transition from cessation to relapse, it is believed that the neuropharmacological consequences of allostatic neuronal or hormonal adaptations result in craving, compulsive drug use, and other disadvantageous behaviors associated with addiction. Prefrontal cortex (PFC), known for its involvement in regulating limbic reward regions and higher-order executive function, is an important target for drug addiction research, in large part due to its strong link to compulsive drug use and the negative-affective states associated with protracted abstinence. Convincing evidence has showed reduced blood flow and thus deactivation in the PFC of drug addicts. Hemodynamic changes and its subsequent inflammatory responses in the brain tissue injured by chronic and recurrent drug insult may comprise essential pathophysiological processes resulting in cerebral ischemia. Indeed, the neurovascular mechanisms underlying the prefrontal excitatory and inhibitory neuroadaptations during abstinence were not characterized across drug classes. Despite diverse treatment options for OUD, including medication (e.g. buprenorphine, methadone, naloxone/naltrexone), inpatient treatment, outpatient harm-reduction program, and counseling that offers cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, or 12-step therapy, the relapse rate is extremely high (91%). Furthermore, there is no biomarker to predict relapse. At the microscopic scale, brain electrical activity greatly relies on neurovascular interactions between neurons, astrocytes and blood vessels. At the macroscopic scale, brain state-dependent network could reflect behaviors and cognition. Hence, one strategy for achieving potential markers that can possibly monitor a patient\u2019s PFC network activity is the use of resting-state functional electro-vascular neuroimaging at the mesoscopic scale (i.e., intermediate level that explores a large population of cells and vessels).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4085, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) has received substantial attention clinically, in large part because of its raising promise linking canonical microcircuit consisting excitatory glutamatergic projection neurons and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, genetics and predicting behavioral achievement and subsequent activation of complementary brain areas when performing task in humans.

Characterizing a mesoscopic-scale PFC network in opiate addiction during protracted abstinence through rsFC may provide insights for deeper understanding of the neurophysiological aspect of brain activity during recovery.

The objective of our study was to determine what the neural oscillatory activity contributes to the profound effect of heroin exposure on abstinence and whether these oscillations are associated with blood oxygenation. We used a bimodal non-invasive neuroimaging strategy that combined electroencephalography (EEG) to provide information about neural synchrony and oscillatory activity with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to provide complementary information about the cerebral blood oxygenation in small vessels in the PFC. This bimodality has several features designed to optimize homogeneity. First, synchronization likelihood (SL) was used to capture the spatio-temporal neural synchrony and the oscillatory activity interactions among whole-brain electrodes to characterize interdependencies between times series as measured by EEG. Second, concentration changes in two chromophores of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) in PFC as measured by fNIRS were obtained to examine regional cerebral blood oxygenation (rCBO) and map functional brain networks. A regional increase in HbO concentration and a decrease in Hb concentration indicate a typical rCBO. Neuroimaging studies provide compelling intravascular evidence that regional brain activity induces a regional arteriolar vasodilation and consequently an increase in regional cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow (CBF)\u2013 known as the neurovascular coupling mechanism (for a recent review see). At the capillary level, the increase in CBF and oxygen delivery exceeds the increase in local oxygen consumption, and therefore, CBO rises locally, indirectly indicating brain activation. Third, a supervised machine learning method was used to obtain correlations between EEG and fNIRS modalities by extracting plausible components in order to provide a relatively precise detection and localization between the electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals.

On the other hand, a condition, such as a local functional ischemia is likely impaired due to dysregulation of glutamate transmission between the glutamatergic synapse and the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on astrocytes, resulting in abnormal blood flow after muscle contraction. Functional connectivity analysis of our hemodynamic data revealed abnormal blood metabolism and weakened connectivity strength in the PFC in chronic HD patients. This macroscopic interpretation may reflect neurovascular abnormality associated with functional ischemia in PFC in opiate-using patients. Indeed, our hemodynamic data are in line with prior neuroimaging studies consistently reporting that decreased rCBF in the frontal cortex was found in opiate-dependent subjects, and suggesting that opiate addiction was associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular ischemia. These pathological findings may be due to recurrent opiate-induced episodes of hypoxias. Future studies with advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or single-photon emission computed tomography, computed tomography angiography, may enhance and confirm the diagnosis of functional ischemia in blood vessels of the cortex associated with opiate addiction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24449, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Oscillatory desynchronization is induced by disorganizing information (neuronal or hormonal) flow, which is thought to result from dysfunction in the glutamine-GABA balance between brain regions. We found global desynchronization of EEG networks in a large spectrum of low frequency bands comprising delta, theta, and lower alpha bands in HD patients. CBPT analysis also revealed local desynchronization in the lower alpha frequency band in the patient group. One reason could be that long-distanced interactions incline to involve synchrony in low frequencies, putting less constraints on the timing precision due to long phases of enhanced and reduced excitability. Although this mechanism is unknown, disturbed neural oscillations at these low frequencies are thought to relate to disable coordinated activity during normal functioning.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25289, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Further, alpha rhythms, the most prominent over occipitoparietal cortex, especially during eye-closed and relaxed alert states, is generated in thalamus, in which its projection to the cortex drives and modulates cortical activity, such as control of cognition and social behavior. This thalamocortical alpha synchrony results from reciprocal interactions between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons whereby the synchronization is sustained by gap junctions among GABAergic interneurons. This mechanism is modulated, in part, by glutamatergic afferents acting via mGluRs. Thus, this explanation reconciles our quest that dysregulation of glutamatergic transmission may be, in large part, on astrocytes, and that glutamine astrocytes activation may play an important role in long-term withdrawal in OUD. It opens a door for future neuroplastic studies to navigate the astroglial proinflammatory response as well as the role of GABAergic interneurons in the corticolimbic circuitry by chronic opiate insult and its anti-inflammatory response by abstinence. Furthermore, disturbed alpha synchronization has also been showed in bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Fragile X syndrome (for a review in neural synchrony in brain disorders, see Uhlhaas et al.). Hence, the heroin-induced local desynchronization in the lower alpha rhythm from our EEG data supports the notion that brain oscillations can serve as biomarkers in neuropsychiatric disorders, in our case opiate addiction. It also suggests that local synchronization in the upper alpha rhythm in PFC may contribute a sign of recovery after prolonged cessation from heroin. The EEG-fNIRS bimodality can be advantageous for brain state-dependent electrotherapy, as well as predict responses to emotional cues and behavior performance in OUD rehabilitation. This computational approach is based on the assumption that homeostasis of the brain microenvironment is maintained through blood vessels, neurons, and astrocytes by the excitation-inhibition balance in the microcircuits. Notably, during abstinence, our fusion data, in line with previous cellular neuroadaptation literature in chronic opiate during tolerance and withdrawal suggesting that hemostatic adaptation in glutamate-GABA balance is developed through neural and neuron-glia network in opiate addiction, may be a result of disturbed glutamate hemostasis, leading to the enhanced lower-alpha amplitude in the right FP and depressed in the left FP of PFC in HD patients. Further, in a given brain region, the power of alpha oscillations increases as the overall neuronal activity decreases. Hence, the asymmetric excitability in PFC in HD patients revealed the profound effect of chronic heroin and recapitulated the glutamate hemostasis hypothesis. Some structural neuroimaging studies also showed asymmetry in PFC in abstinent heroin addicts in which reduced grey-matter density was found in the right PFC. Although the study of relationship between structural and functional changes in brain network is still ongoing, one multimodal neuroimaging study found that diminished gray-matter volume was positively associated with low perfusion in frontal area in heroin-dependent subjects.

Though, fNIRS has some exclusive properties that may be leveraged over other neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, because fNIRS offers biochemically specificity by measuring concentrations of HbO and Hb and can be beneficial when localizing brain activity, especially in situations in which drug-dependent patients who may have difficulty to lie patiently in a magnet scanner.
