However, the frequently used log-fold change metric is not ideally suited for assessing the potential effect of expression changes for individual miRNAs because it does not reflect mean expression levels. To determine the change in expression, we introduced the count-change metric, a combination of base mean expression and log-fold change, to weigh DE miRNAs against one another. Notably, the male-originated LA-N-5 cells responded more strongly to the neurokine stimulus, showing more DE miRNAs with a trend toward higher count-change values (mean of absolute count-change across all DE time points, 20,907 versus 3,066, p\u00a0= 0.08).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20399, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Pico- to nanomolar concentrations of CNTF, well within its physiological range, elevated the cholinergic marker genes CHAT (p value/day 3 of experiment [pDay3]\u00a0= 0.005, pDay4\u00a0= 4.1E\u221205) and SLC18A3 (also known as vAChT, pDay2\u00a0= 0.002, pDay4\u00a0= 0.001).

Second, a recent study demonstrates that most sex bias in gene expression has arisen since the last common ancestor of boroeutherian mammals (including mouse, rat, dog, macaque, and human), resulting in inadequate representation of sexual dimorphism in any non-human model organism. Third, current animal models of SCZ and BD do not faithfully represent human pathology, showing no predictive power of the clinical efficacy of therapeutic agents. Additionally, the resolution of differential expression analysis in sequencing is much higher in a homogeneous cell population such as neuronal cell culture because sexual dimorphism can also manifest in distinct tissue composition. However, this choice also entails limitations. Although very similar, LA-N-2 and LA-N-5 cells are immortalized cells derived from two distinct donor individuals, which must be considered when interpreting sexual dimorphisms based on their total transcriptional divergence.

Therapy with miRNA-like molecules can also potentially ameliorate tachyphylactic effects by targeting a gene and its regulatory elements at the same time (essentially via feedforward loops), as implicated by the nested regulatory circuits we observed.

We found a minimal score of 6 to suffice for a good balance between type I and II errors. In case of whole-genome interactions, this threshold was raised to 7 to enable computational accessibility in all steps (in this case, graphical analysis was the bottleneck). The database was supplemented by comprehensive transcription factor targeting data via bioinformatically processed \u201ccap analysis of gene expression\u201d (CAGE), focusing on brain tissues, including the tissue-specific transcriptional activities (Figure\u00a0S5).

Briefly, the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of human AChE mRNA was cloned into the microRNA Target Selection System plasmid (System Biosciences, CA, USA) multiple cloning site, using EcoRI and NotI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. For luciferase assays, HEK293T cells were transfected with miRNA Target Selection-AChE-3\u2032UTR, and selected in the presence of Puromycin for 3\u00a0weeks. Stably transfected HEK293T (293T-AChE 3\u2032UTR) cells were grown on 12-well plates and infected with lentiviruses expressing miR-125b-5p, miR-132-3p or a negative control sequence. After 48 hours incubation, cells were analyzed using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, WI USA) and Luciferase activity was measured using an Envision luminescent plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA), essentially as previously described. For each reporter construct, renilla luciferase activity was normalized according to that of the firefly. Normalized activity after infection of miR-132-3p or miR-125b-5p was expressed as relative to that obtained after infection with the same plasmid with miR negative control. For life/death assay, a similar protocol was used. Stably transfected HEK293T (293T-AChE 3\u2032UTR) cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing miR-125b-5p, miR-132-3p or a negative control sequence. 72 hours post-infection a cytotoxic reporter fused to AChE 3\u2032-UTR was added to the media and cells were kept for an additional 5\u00a0days to assess their viability.
