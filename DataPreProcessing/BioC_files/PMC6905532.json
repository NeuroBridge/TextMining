The presence of such states during a resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan is significantly anti-correlated with diagnosed schizophrenia, significantly anti-correlated with connectivity between subcortical networks and auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks and also significantly anti-correlated with contemporaneous occupancy of transient functional network connectivity states featuring broad disconnectivity or strong inhibitory connections between the default mode and other networks. Conversely, the presence of highly polarized vn-BOLD states is significantly correlated with connectivity strength between auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks and with contemporaneous occupancy of transient whole-brain patterns of strongly modularized network connectivity and diffuse hyperconnectivity. Despite their consistency with well-documented effects of schizophrenia on static and time-varying functional network connectivity, the observed relationships between polarization and network connectivity are with very few exceptions unmediated by schizophrenia diagnosis. Many differences observed between patients and controls are echoed within the patient population itself in the effect patterns of positive symptomology (e.g. hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity). Our findings highlight a particular whole-brain spatiotemporal BOLD activation phenomenon that differs markedly between healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients, one that also strongly informs time-resolved network connectivity patterns that are associated with this serious clinical disorder.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2165, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2178, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While there is growing attention in human blood-oxygenation dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies focused on time-varying connectivity between functional networks and even on time-varying spatial structure of the network maps, much less attention is given to the global spatial dynamics of activated brain space induced by and facilitating time-varying network relationships. These ambient whole-brain spatiotemporal phenomena can exhibit strong relationships with disease and provide a wider-angle lens through which to view the results of network-level analyses. We present here one example of a dynamically varying spatial phenomenon that correlates very strongly with schizophrenia diagnosis, exhibits structured and robust effects on observed functional network connectivity (FNC), correlates significantly with occupancy of certain dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) state and also exposes very different patterns of spatiotemporal dynamics and organization in schizophrenia patients (SZs) and healthy controls (HCs). The basis of this analysis is an early-stage transformation of the pre-processed BOLD fMRI volume into voxelwise normalized form (vn-BOLD /vn-fMRI). Although every voxel spends exactly a third of its time in the upper (resp. lower, resp. middle) third of its own intrinsic activation profile, the proportion of gray-matter voxels simultaneously in the upper (resp. lower) third of their respective activation profiles during given TRs is highly variable.

These polarized regimes are also very strongly correlated with short-timescale whole-brain functional network connectivity states (some positive, some negative correlations in which the effect direction differs between patients and controls for the highly modularized connectivity state exhibiting negative DMN-to-other connections). The phenomenon of widespread polarization can be parsed more finely in spatial terms, and doing so also reveals distinctions between patients and controls. Examples include the determination of each voxel\u2019s \u201cpolarity participation rate\u201d which is its probability of being in the top (resp. bottom) third of its own activation profile at times when this condition holds for a large proportion of voxels, i.e. when the whole brain is in a polarized state. We find that the spatial distribution of voxelwise polarity participation differs significantly between patients and controls; in controls there are large clearly delineated regions characterized by very high polarity participation rates, while in patients the larger and better defined regions are those that represent very low rates of polarity participation. Another way to probe the time-varying spatial structure of polarized voxels is to recode (polarity code) voxel timeseries as {\u22121,0,1} according to whether the voxel is in the bottom, middle or top third of its intrinsic activation profile at each TR. The polarity-coded brain maps can then be clustered into a set of brainwide voxel co-polarization patterns, providing a spatially explicit parameterization of polarity space in which subject trajectories can be studied.

Details are available in. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was collected from 163 healthy controls (117 males, 46 females; mean age 36.9) and 151 age and gender matched patients with schizophrenia (114 males, 37 females; mean age 37.8) during eyes-closed conditions at 7 different sites across United States. Data for six of the seven sites was collected on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio System. One site used a 3T General Electric Discovery MR750 scanner. All resting state fMRI scans were acquired using a standard gradient-echo echo planar imaging paradigm: FOV of 220 \u00d7 220 mm (64 \u00d7 64 matrix), TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, FA = 770, 162 volumes, 32 sequential ascending axial slices of 4 mm thickness and 1 mm skip. Data processing was performed using a combination of toolboxes (AFNI1, SPM2, GIFT3) and custom code written in Matlab. We performed rigid body motion correction using the INRIAlign toolbox in SPM to correct for subject head motion followed by slice-timing correction to account for timing differences in slice acquisition. To mitigate the impact of outliers, the data was despiked using AFNI's 3dDespike algorithm. Individual subject scans were then warped to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and resampled to 3 mm3 isotropic voxels. Instead of gaussian smoothing, we smoothed the data to 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) using AFNI's BlurToFWHM algorithm which performs smoothing by a conservative finite difference approximation to the diffusion equation, an approach that has been shown to reduce scanner specific variability in smoothness providing \u201csmoothness equivalence\u201d to data across sites. Each voxel time course was variance normalized prior to performing group independent component analysis as this has shown to better decompose subcortical sources in addition to cortical networks. Following the early stage processing, the data from all subjects was decomposed using group independent component analysis (GICA) into 100 network spatial maps (http://icatb.sourceforge.net) of which 47 were identified as functionally meaningful resting state networks (RSNs). Subject specific spatial maps (SMs) and timecourses (TCs) were obtained from the group level spatial maps via spatiotemporal regression. The timecourses were detrended, orthogonalized with respect to estimated subject motion parameters, then despiked and band-pass filtered into [0.05,0.15] Hz using a 5th order Butterworth filter. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC) between RSN timecourses was estimated using a sliding window approach. Following protocols from recent studies on dynamic connectivity, we used a tapered rectangular window length of 22 TRs (44 seconds), shifted 1TR forward at a time and computed pairwise correlations between RSN time courses within these windows. Static, or traditional functional network connectivity (FNC) simply uses a single untapered window of length 162TR, the length of the scan. The 47 functionally meaningful networks retained from the 100 component GICA all into 5 broad functional domains: subcortical (SC, 5 networks), auditory (AUD, 2 networks); visual (VIS, 11 networks), sensorimotor (SM, 6 networks), cognitive control (CC, 13 networks), default mode network (DMN, 7 networks), cerebellar (CB, 2 networks).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10318, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Pre-processing of 4D volumes for the polarity analysis was identical to that for dFNC, except for the inclusion of a voxelwise detrending step and the omission of the spatial smoothing step that typically precedes GICA.

Due to the high dimensionality of the samples (i.e., membership in a given cluster can arise predominantly from good matching of some arbitrary collection of tens of thousands of voxels to other cluster members, while still leaving thousands of degrees of freedom), the determination of what it means for one of these centroids to represent a \u201cpervasively polarized\u201d brain state is necessarily somewhat subjective. We have decided on a criterion based loosely on the asymptotic distributions of sample means for a set of identically distributed uniform discrete random variables under a convenient (but not entirely valid assumption) of independence. The sample is quite large so the asymptotic framing is not entirely unreasonable. We will say that a CoPP represents a strongly polarized state if the probability that the magnitude of the absolute mean |\u03bcCoPP| of its elements would have probability less than \u03b1 = 0.001 under a very conservative adaptation of above-stated model. The sign of \u03bcCoPP in such a case determines if that CoPP is positively or negatively polarized. Since voxels assume values +1,0 ans -1 with equal probability, i.e. , we assume by the central limit theorem that the within-cluster voxel means are distributed as  where ci is the number of observations in the cluster, and thus the global mean \u03bci of the whole set of v = 60303  random variables is distributed as .

To account for the high level of spatiotemporal dependence and produce a distribution whose far tails do not include values with magnitude smaller than 10\u22125, we first reduce ci by treating all timepoints from a given subject as dependent, so that cluster i is treated as containing ni = 314ri samples, where ri is the population-averaged occupancy rate of cluster i.

This is a slightly unconventional type of timeseries to approach with convolutional feature extraction techniques, however it can be handles by treating the 1D symbolic timeseries in a N-letter alphabet as an N-channel binary 1D timeseries, which is effectively a multivariate timeseries in which exactly one of the channels (or univariate consitutent timeseries) takes value 1 at every timestep, while all others are 0 at that timestep.

These initial decompositions are followed by evaluations of network connectivity that also tend to rely on correlation, a scale-invariant quantity. Using the five time-resolved connectivity states reported in earlier work from this dataset we probe the relationship between polarity and time-varying connectivity by investigating the occupancy rates of the polarized dPR states within windows characterized by each of the five different dynamic connectivity states (see Fig 10). For each dFNC state, we perform a two-sample t-test on the subject-level occupancy rate of polarized dPR states during windows characterized by that dFNC state vs. subject-level occupancy rates of polarized dPR states on all windows. This is assessing group-wise, the degree to which polarized dPR states occupancies during the 22TR windows characterized by any specific dFNC state are distinguished from other 22TR windows in a subject\u2019s scan. The polarized dPR occupancy rates are at the subject-level, computed window-wise for each of the 22TR windows characterized by a given dFNC states for that subject. The number of such windows per subject will vary, so the number of polarized dPR occupancy rates recorded for different subjects for any given dFNC state can be different, and when this count differs between two subjects, the number of occupancy rates recorded for those subjects from windows characterized by any other dFNC state will also be different. This somewhat cumbersome procedure allows for testing the role of polarized dPRs in realizing each dFNC state, correcting for the tendency of a given subject to be in polarized dPR states more generally. And since the t-tests are done at the group level, i.e. they are tests of the entire set of polarized dPR occupancy rates associated with windows characterized by a given dFNC state for all healthy controls (resp. all SZ patients) vs. the entire set of polarized dPR occupancy rates associated with windows characterized by all other dFNC states for all healthy controls (resp. all SZ patients) it is accounting for the different baseline polarized dPR occupancy rates for each group HCs have a higher baseline occupancy rate for the polarized dPR states.

Controls exhibit a greater \u201cdynamic range\u201d than patients, a finding consistent with several other recent results. In this setting however, the extra dynamic range puts controls repeatedly in parts of the polarity space that are proximal to more pervasive forms of both positive and negative polarization, increasing the odds of repeatedly entering those states. In healthy controls the most probable exit itinerary from any CoPP has a short transient of at most one intermediate state, followed by entry into the absorbing length-9 periodic orbit joining the most strongly polarized states of both valencies.

Our findings indicate that the healthy brain, through some combination of neural, vascular and neurovascular coupling factors, is strongly characterized by the degree to which it exhibits periods of spatially pervasive elevated (resp. depressed) vn-BOLD activation (see Fig 3 and Fig 8). The relative inability of schizophrenia patients to organize this level of pervasive polarization is extremely statistically significant (p<10\u221211). There are also significant differences between healthy and patient populations in the spatial distribution of voxel participation in these states of pervasive brain polarization with stronger structured regions of highly participating voxels among healthy controls (Fig 6). This large-scale brain polarization phenomenon exhibits tractable and clinically relevant interactions with familiar connectivity-based targets of fMRI analysis: functional network spatial maps, functional network connectivity and dynamic functional network connectivity. The voxels most drawn into whole-brain polarization states distribute differently over group-level GICA spatial maps in patients and controls (see Fig 7): auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks contain more voxels with high polarity participation rates in controls than patients whereas subcortical and cerebellar networks contain more voxels with high polarity participation rates in patients than controls. There are also significant relationships between polarization and short-timescale functional network connectivity states (Fig 10), relationships that are predominantly unmediated by clinical status with the single exception of the highly modularized state with negative correlations between default-mode and other networks. This dynamic connectivity state is significantly more occupied by controls under conditions of higher than average polarization, while its occupancies by patients are both more numerous and occur under conditions of lower than average levels of whole-brain polarization. In traditional \u201cstatic\u201d FNC the largely unmediated relationship between polarization and the structure of network correlations/anti-correlations persists (Fig 11). Polarization both guides/constrains and is built from underlying networks and their connectivity. We show that the phenomenon of dynamic, large-scale spatially pervasive polarization in vn-BOLD fMRI is strongly suppressed among those with diagnosed schizophrenia however, with significant intensification of the suppressive effect among patients with higher positive symptomology scores (Fig 3). Positive symptoms include the core psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia: delusions and hallucinations. We have also shown that patients and controls exhibit very different patterns of voxel participation in the polarized TRs (Fig 6). The difference in spatial patterns of \u201cpolarity participation\u201d between patients and controls is also present at the network scale. Again it is not clear whether this arises more from voxel effects aggregating into network effects or whether coherent network behavior is shaping most of the voxel participation patterns. Drilling into the transient spatial patterns of discretized voxel IALs yields a set of 13 whole brain co-polarization patterns (CoPPs) that capture, among other things, multiple ways the collection of voxels simultaneously at a given intrinsic activation level (IAL) distribute spatially at timepoints when the whole brain occupies the corresponding dPR state (e.g. voxels with IAL = 1 when the whole brain is occupying the polarized-high dPR state). The most strongly polarized CoPPs are significantly more occupied by controls than patients which is consistent with results from the coarse polarity summary provided by dPR state occupancies (Fig 8). However, with CoPPs, we also see group-level evidence of a healthy circuit itinerary in polarity space that cycles through the maximally positively polarized CoPP, progressing through four CoPPs with increasing presence and strength of negatively polarized regions until reaching the maximally negatively polarized CoPPs and returning again to the maximally positively polarized CoPP through three intermediate transition states. Using the group-averaged transition probabilities for healthy subjects, i.e. tracing from the most strongly positively polarized CoPP using the highest group-average probability forward-time transition (to a different state) and continuing in this manner leads through the most strongly negatively polarized CoPP and then to back to the most strongly positively polarized CoPP again, presenting a group-level most probable healthy itinerary through polarity space accounting for 9 of the 13 CoPPs, including the most strongly polarized states. For schizophrenia patients the group-level most probable forward-time trajectory out of the maximally positively polarized CoPP never recovers a significant level of polarity, either positive or negative, instead alternating between two non-polarized states (Fig 12).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 55580, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Phenomena involving voxels reaching peak activity on similar timelines either across subjects following a stimulus (e.g. ingestion of glucose) or on voxel subsets within-subjects satisfying behavioral constraints (e.g. exhibiting characteristics of epileptic spiking) have been documented in the past. There are many neurobiological and vascular factors that could be contributing to the observed tendency of the healthy brain to organize itself toward globally polarized vn-BOLD states, and multiple pathways by which this convergence fails to materialize as fully or as frequently among schizophrenia patients. The inability to \u201cfully polarize\u201d has both locally structured and global manifestations (note that both the strongly polarized structured CoPPs and the strongly pervasively polarized CoPPs in Fig 8 are significantly more occupied by controls, and further, in Fig 12, that strongly polarized structured states are precursors to strongly pervasively polarized state in the attracting orbit for healthy controls). This is simply to point out that the phenomenon we have observed manifests on both local and more global scales, and its disruption in schizophrenia patients is evident at both of these scales. From a neural perspective the difference between patients and controls could arise from factors such as imbalanced inhibition and excitation, impeded propagation due to locally weakened coupling or disrupted patterns of top-town feedback, any of which could be influenced by excessive synaptic pruning among other possible physiological underpinnings. As an early-stage exploratory analysis the present study has many limitations and possible directions of extension. The results will certainly depend on the resolution of the initial discretization for example. The role of vascular factors can be further elucidated by performing a similar analysis on data from non-BOLD modalities such as EEG and MEG. Finally, while CoPPs and their dynamic itineraries offer some insight into the formation dynamics of highly polarized states, they do not in our view satisfactorily resolve the dominant pathways by which polarization diffuses through much of the brain. Although there are many additional directions to take with this work, we believe that the proposed approach provides a powerful new perspective on the disruption of brain function, represents a novel way of studying resting fMRI data that does not rely on the standard network-based paradigm, and has the potential to lead to additional biomarkers of brain disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations":
