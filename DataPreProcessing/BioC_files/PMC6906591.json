We show evidence of evolutionary modifications of human brain connectivity to significantly overlap with the cortical pattern of schizophrenia-related dysconnectivity (P < 0.001, permutation testing).

We further assessed the specificity of effects by examining brain dysconnectivity patterns in seven other psychiatric and neurological brain disorders (including, among others, major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, arguably characterized by behavioural symptoms that are less specific to humans), which showed no such associations with modifications of human brain connectivity. Comparisons of brain connectivity across humans, chimpanzee and macaques further suggest that features of connectivity that evolved in the human lineage showed the strongest association to the disorder, that is, brain circuits potentially related to human evolutionary specializations.

First, while human-specific connections showed involvement in schizophrenia dysconnectivity as compared to species-shared connections, no such effect was found for the class of human-chimpanzee-specific [i.e. connections found in chimpanzees (and humans), not in macaques] (P > 0.05, Fig. 5). The differential levels of overlap with schizophrenia dysconnectivity for the three classes shown in Fig. 5 suggest a \u2018step-off\u2019 effect between human and chimpanzees, rather than a \u2018step-wise\u2019 effect of schizophrenia dysconnectivity across the three species. Second, examining the subset of species-shared connections of which humans showed higher fractional anisotropy compared to chimpanzees (i.e. human > chimpanzee, P < 0.05) showed a significantly higher level of schizophrenia dysconnectivity (P = 0.0014) compared to species-shared connections, but no such effect was found for connections for which chimpanzees showed higher connectivity weights than macaques (i.e. chimpanzees > macaques, P = 0.17). Furthermore, no specific relationship was found when we examined normalized fractional anisotropy in species-shared connections between chimpanzee and macaque (i.e. between-group differences in fractional anisotropy in connections shared between chimpanzees and macaques) and the pattern of schizophrenia dysconnectivity (r = 0.06, P = 0.29).

Such a trade-off may involve increased selection pressure for long-range associative connections to maintain the integrity of the network in expanding brains, and could potentially have resulted in an increased vulnerability of relatively sparse long-range connections that manifests as pathology and associated disrupted cognitive functioning in humans. Neuroimaging studies have indeed suggested that topologically important association pathways may be particularly involved in schizophrenia. The evolutionary development of such white matter pathways in the human brain satisfy the increased pressure for cortico-cortical integration resulting from brain enlargement but may also contribute to pathological vulnerability for schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29625, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The examined set of human-specific connections involved cortico-cortical connections around the language network, including the posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus, left middle temporal gyrus, left pars opercularis, left inferior parietal cortex, and posterior parts of the left middle temporal gyrus. These regions have an integral role in semantic comprehension and language processing. Furthermore, observed human-specific connections included connections of the orbitofrontal cortex, parietal and temporal associative cortex, cortical areas and connections involved in cognitive control, social cognition, emotional processing, and affiliative behaviour. These brain functions are commonly suggested to be compromised in schizophrenia. In a post hoc analysis we cross-correlated the cortical map of human-specific connections with cortical mappings of human brain functions derived from the Neurosynth dataset (a large standardized collation of meta-analytic data of 10 000+ functional MRI studies on various cognitive tasks) (Supplementary material), which indicated potential involvement of the set of human-specific connections in \u2018numerical cognition\u2019, \u2018verbal semantics\u2019, \u2018cognitive control\u2019 and \u2018inhibition\u2019 (all P < 0.05, FDR corrected) (Supplementary Table 8). Several of these functions have been suggested to be altered in schizophrenia, which supports the notion of evolutionary development of certain human cognitive functions\u2014and accompanied modifications in brain circuitry\u2014to relate to aspects of the disorder. We note in this context that human-specific connections do not necessarily imply the evolution of completely new white matter tracts in and around these areas. Instead, these connections could involve enhancement of evolutionarily conserved tracts between cortical areas, but with more elaborate and widespread projections resulting in new region-to-region connections in the service of enhanced brain functionality. Indeed, homologues of frontal-temporal language areas (i.e. Wernicke\u2019s and Broca\u2019s areas) for example have been reported across several primate species, but with humans exhibiting modified microstructural organization and more specialized connectivity, presumably related to development of specialized language processing skills in humans.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31928, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our findings suggest that evolutionary modifications in brain connectivity in humans may have played a role in the development of aspects of schizophrenia.

Our findings also do not imply that all brain changes in schizophrenia can be traced back to evolutionary modifications, nor that all aspects of schizophrenia can be explained from an evolutionary viewpoint. In contrast, schizophrenia is a multifactorial condition, with many genetic, brain, lifestyle and environmental factors all playing a role in the development of the disorder. Our findings merely suggest that recent evolutionary modifications in brain circuitry in humans may have been one of the factors that have played a role in the development of the disorder in humans.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32828, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In contrast to our findings in schizophrenia, we did not observe similar involvement of human-specific connections in brain dysconnectivity in ASD, OCD, major depression, bvFTD, and/or Alzheimer\u2019s disease and MCI. A moderate (non-significant) trend effect was only found for bipolar disorder, a disorder that shows genetic overlap with schizophrenia and is also characterized by high levels of psychosis. From these null findings we tentatively conclude that human modifications of brain connectivity may be particularly related to the pattern of dysconnectivity related to psychosis. This interpretation is supported by the suggestion that certain other psychiatric traits, such as low mood, depression, and anxiety can also manifest in non-human animals and may thus potentially be more related to changes in other brain circuitry. OCD-like traits such as abnormal repetitive behaviour are, for example, suggested to exist in non-human animals and believed to relate to aspects of comparable frontostriatal circuitry between animals and human patients. Similarly, case studies have reported spontaneous autistic traits in developing non-human primates, with underlying genetic variations overlapping with those in humans, suggesting that these traits may potentially be more associated with alterations in brain circuitry shared between humans and other primates. However, it is important to consider differences in examined group sample sizes (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7), which results in different levels of statistical power across the examined disorder datasets, limiting direct comparison of effects across disorders. Furthermore, it is important to note that like schizophrenia, the other disorders also involve widespread changes in brain structure and function (; for review see) and evolutionary pressure on brain organization may have similarly played a role in other aspects of the biological background of these conditions. We do not rule out that other aspects of brain connectivity (e.g. function, developmental topological layout etc.) may still be related to evolutionary processes in these conditions. Future studies further examining the potential contribution of evolutionary changes in brain organization to schizophrenia and other mental disorders are of interest.

Other primate species seem to have not evolved a connectome layout vulnerable to brain dysconnectivity associated with schizophrenia traits. This is supported by comparative genomic studies. Genetic loci associated with schizophrenia tend to be more prevalent in areas of the genome subject to recent positive selection in humans, consistent with the hypothesis that risk for schizophrenia has developed in recent human evolution. Human accelerated regions of the genome (HAR) for example have been noted to be enriched for schizophrenia risk genes, with mutations in these genes related to disruptions in cognition and social behaviour. In a post hoc analysis, we used gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to examine the transcriptomic profile of HAR genes across cortical regions, and we indeed observed indications of higher expression of HAR genes in cortical areas that display human-specific connections compared to regions mostly connected by shared connections (P = 0.0048, permutation testing) (Supplementary material). This corroborates recent observations that HAR genes may have played a key role in shaping higher-order cognitive functional networks during recent human brain evolution.

However, it remains difficult to rule out all effects of brain volume or global data differences. Furthermore, despite validation of our findings with the homologous BB-38 atlas, the potential impact of areas being more or less variable within and across species remains unknown.

However, dysconnectivity effects in schizophrenia do not generally seem to strongly relate to medication effects.

In a post hoc analysis we verified that there was no general (i.e. non-disease related) tendency to find random between-group effects in human-specific connections (Supplementary material). We further note that given the mentioned limitations of diffusion MRI, despite our rather strict selection of human-specific connections, we cannot fully rule out that some of the connections classified as human-specific could exist in the chimpanzee population. These tracts could have a much lower microstructural organization in chimpanzees (e.g. lower axonal count, less myelination together resulting in low DWI signal), making them undetectable in this group.
