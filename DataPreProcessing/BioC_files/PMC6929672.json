Many addictive drugs engage the dopaminergic circuits and quantitatively scale the reward responses, which eventually lead to compulsive drug seeking. In humans, use of cocaine and other psycho-stimulants is widely associated with suppression of appetite and reduced body weight. It is possible that chronic cocaine exposure results in diminished response of the reward circuits to food and, as a result, less motivation for food intake. On the other hand, an earlier study demonstrated that, despite reduced body weight, cocaine-dependent men consumed more high-fat and -carbohydrate food. Further, cocaine-dependent men showed a decrease in plasma leptin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue to suppress hunger, compared with non-drug\u2013using controls. Thus, contrary to the common conception, reduced body weight in cocaine users does not appear to result from a decrease in appetite and food intake, and overeating during early abstinence may simply reflect the use of food as a drug substitute. These findings raise the important questions of how cocaine-addicted and non-drug\u2013using individuals may differ in the responses of the motivational circuits to food intake or exposure to food cues and how cocaine-addicted individuals differ in the responses to drug vs food intake or exposure to drug vs food cues.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4505, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Examining brain activations to food and cocaine cues in 20 individuals with cocaine dependence (CD) with both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, a recent work reported that cocaine and food cues elicited similar circuit responses and that striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding potentials modulated these responses. Specifically, the authors observed \u201cdeactivations\u201d of the ventral striatum (VS) and hypothalamus to food and cocaine as compared with neutral cues, with less deactivation in the hypothalamus to cocaine than to food cues. The study highlighted hypothalamic responses to cue exposure; on the other hand, as acknowledged by the authors, the findings of lower hypothalamus and VS activations were surprising and in contrast to the literature of enhanced dopaminergic circuit activation to drug cues. The authors suggested that the findings might reflect the use of videos rather than pictures in their cue reactivity paradigms. Using picture cues, we previously examined regional responses in 23 cocaine-dependent individuals exposed to cocaine vs neutral cues during fMRI, and, at a corrected threshold, observed higher hypothalamic activation to cocaine vs neutral cues. Importantly, the extent of hypothalamic but not other regional response was correlated with craving and cocaine addiction severity, assessed by the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ) and Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA), respectively.

These findings along with those reported by Ersche and colleagues suggest that cocaine misuse is associated with diminished response to natural reinforcers perhaps only relatively to response to cocaine.

First, the study comprised a small sample size. However, we wish to emphasize that both the imaging findings and the correlations between regional activations and clinical variables were significant with full consideration of multiple comparisons. Second, CD and HC differed in years of cigarette smoking. Although we included years of smoking as a covariate when comparing CD and HC, we could not entirely rule out the effects of cigarette smoking on the current findings. Third, participants were instructed to fast after midnight on the day of MR scan, and all reported not eating or drinking anything but water before scans. However, we did not have an objective measure to confirm their reports. Fourth, the whole-brain analyses did not reveal striatal responses to drug or food cues. The striatum has been implicated in cue-induced craving and reward-related processing, whereas some studies of cue-induced craving did not demonstrate striatal activation. Although not a primary aim of the current study, we conducted a ROI analysis focusing on the VS and dorsal striatum. The VS showed significant increases in activation for \u201ccocaine vs neutral\u201d compared with \u201cfood vs neutral\u201d in CD (P\u2009=\u2009.01) but not between CD and HC for \u201cfood vs neutral (P\u2009=\u2009.89).\u201d These findings are consistent with an earlier meta-analysis suggesting that cue-elicited VS activation is largely significant only in ROI analysis. The dorsal striatum did not show significant differences for either contrast (P\u2009=\u2009.32 and P\u2009=\u2009.24, respectively). Thus, the role of striatal activity and striatal hypothalamic interaction in supporting cue-related responses remains to be clarified. A related consideration is that in block design of fMRI studies, investigators have used varying block duration, depending on the type of stimulus. The great majority of studies employed 10\u201360 seconds, although some researchers suggest an optimal duration of 15 seconds. In the current study, we followed our previous studies of cue-elicited craving and employed 36-second blocks. It is possible that the striatal cue responses may be more transient and readily visible in experiments with shorter block duration. Fifth, CCQ scores were obtained every 2 to 3 days during the 2- to 3-week inpatient stay with the intention to understand how cocaine craving may evolve during early abstinence. However, we did not notice any consistent patterns of change (perhaps due to the small sample size and short duration of assessment), and across participants the day-to-day variation was quite limited. We averaged the CCQ scores across assessments to reflect tonic craving. Nonetheless, the hypothalamus activation was also significantly correlated with the CCQ score obtained on the day closest to MRI (P\u2009=\u2009.0013, r\u2009=\u20090.67).
