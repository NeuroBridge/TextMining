The main feature of drug addiction is the inability to resist one's urge to obtain and take addictive drugs even though it can cause serious negative consequences. Worldwide, the abuse of amphetamine-type stimulants is a global and growing phenomenon. In China, the proportion of amphetamine-type stimulants abusers (ATSAs) is continuously increasing over the past several years.

One of the main brain regions underlying addiction is the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain nucleus well recognized as a center of rewarding processes.

Besides, the NAc is a major input structure of the basal ganglia, thus it can integrate information from cortical and limbic regions and further modulate goal-directed behaviors. The NAc plays a pivotal role in refining action selection and mediating the rewarding effects of drugs abuse.

Some researchers have studied the RSFC in substance-dependent populations, including individuals addicted to heroin, nicotine, and cocaine. These resting-state fMRI findings provide evidence that regions related to reward and cognitive control are involved in addiction. A possible mechanism for drug addiction has been proposed by disrupted functional connectivity of the NAc in resting state. It has been shown that the RSFC of NAc, especially its interaction with the prefrontal cortices, was related to impulsive behavior. Exposures to addictive cues could decrease its RSFC to the prefrontal lobe. Further, the disrupted RSFC of NAc and prefrontal cortical regions has been reported in substance use disorder.

Numerous studies confirmed multi-aspect heterogeneity of the NAc, resulting the most intensely investigated shell-core dichotomy in animal models. In human neuroimaging, multimodal connectivity-based parcellation also reveals a shell-core dichotomy of the human NAc. The shell-like and core-like subdivisions of NAc were both found to facilitate the selection of the best reward functionally, but promote different patterns of behavior. The shell-like subdivision, located in the ventromedial NAc, plays a role in the selection of the best reward by suppressing non- or less rewards stimuli that may obstruct with the best reward predicting stimuli. The core-like subdivision, located in the dorsolateral NAc, plays a role in the selection of the best reward by selectively stimulating incentive stimuli that are associated with the best reward. All these researches indicate the dissociable roles of the NAc subdivisions to some extent. For now, no study has investigated the functional roles that different subdivisions of NAc may play in ATSA. Thus, it is not clear whether there are common changes of the RSFC across the different NAc subdivisions or distinct changes for each subdivision underlying the mechanism of addiction.

It is well-accepted that most addictive drugs exert their initial reinforcing effects by inducing large dopamine rapidly in the NAc. This effect can render the drugs as highly salient, drive people\u2019s strong motivations and stimulate compulsive drug-seeking behaviors. The OFC is a major brain region of cognitive impulse control. Previous study found that subjects with OFC lesions are more impulsive overall compared both to normal controls and to those with non-OFC brain damage. By using transcranial direct current stimulation applied over OFC, researchers found participants had improved ability to inhibit inappropriate responses. It is speculated that the elevated response in NAc combined with a disturbed cognitive control function in prefrontal cortex might lead to compulsive addictive behavior when facing rewarding cues. Consistent with this speculation, reduced connectivity strength between the NAc and the OFC has been found in internet gaming disorder. This suggests that abnormal interactions between the rewarding process and cognitive control could be associated with addictions. Our study showed that ATSAs had significantly reduced RSFC with the NAc subdivisions over the left OFC, supporting the disrupted connectivity between the NAc and prefrontal cortices involved in the mechanism of ATSAs. In addition, we found that the RSFCs between the NAc subdivisions and the left OFC were negatively correlated with the addiction severity in ATSAs. This showed that the more severe the ATSAs\u2019 symptoms, the weaker the connectivity between the NAc subdivisions and the left OFC, which provided further evidence that the connectivity between the NAc and prefrontal cortices plays an important role in the pathophysiological basis of ATSAs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24007, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We also found increased positive RSFCs between all the NAc subdivisions and the left IFGoperc when using FWE corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05 for multiple corrections. Many studies have addressed the role of the IFG in response inhibition. Lesion studies in human and nonhuman primates have linked the IFG with the ability to inhibit inappropriate motor responses and functional neuroimaging studies also have implicated the IFG in response inhibition. In substance-dependent individuals, a previous study has found the association between years of cocaine use and go-nogo task-related brain activation. Specifically, greater activation in ventral striatum when facing cocaine cues and greater activation in the IFGoperc when facing response inhibition cues were found in subjects with more years of cocaine use. In our study, there were no significant RSFCs between the NAc subdivisions and the left IFGoperc in the HC group while ATSAs had increased positive RSFCs between the left NAc subdivisions and the left IFGoperc. It should be noted that all the ATSAs recruited in the current study were inpatients and receiving detoxification during scanning. We speculated that these patients needed to constantly struggle with their addiction motivation during hospitalization. Thus, the increased RSFCs between the NAc subdivisions and the left IFGoperc in our study may suggest that ATSAs need to use effortful control resources to resist impulsive addictive drug-seeking behavior when they received detoxification. However, the finding of increased positive RSFCs between the NAc subdivisions and the left IFGoperc in ATSAs did not pass the strict threshold for multiple corrections (i.e., FWE corrected p\u2009<\u20090.0125), whether this connectivity is disrupted and how this connectivity plays a role should be further investigated in the future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25834, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study has several limitations that should be noted. First, we only included males in the study, so the interpretation of the findings should be restricted to males. Secondly, the current findings should be replicated in future using images with higher spatial resolution. Thirdly, our sample size is small, future replications of this investigation are needed to verify these findings. Fourthly, three ATSA participants included in our study had a history of abuse or dependence on alcohol. Previous studies found that alcohol use was associated with weaker prefronto-striatal functional connectivity. Abstinent alcohol-dependent adults also exhibited lower prefronto-striatal functional connectivity. Thus, the abnormal resting-state brain function observed in the ATSAs may be confounded by alcohol intake. ATSAs with history of abuse on alcohol may further reduce the RSFC between the NAc subdivisions and prefrontal cortex. Future studies with alcohol-na\u00efve participants may distinguish the effects of alcohol on resting-state brain function from the effects of amphetamine-type stimulants per se. Lastly, we interpreted the results of RSFC based on the evidence of literature reviews. Thus, the specific functions of RSFC in the NAc subdivisions were not proven in our study. To assess the functions of these altered connectivities in ATSAs, well-designed studies are necessary in the future. For example, by combining fMRI with brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation on prefrontal cortex, we can observe the specific behavior changes in ATSAs and provide additional evidence for the role of the prefrontal-striatal circuit in ATSAs by moderating function of the prefrontal cortex involved in the prefrontal-striatal circuit. In addition, longitudinal studies across acute and remission periods might provide new insight into the characteristics of these alterations and determine whether these changes are trait or state markers in ATSAs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27815, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27826, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, our result demonstrated that the NAc subdivisions, the center of reward processing, had altered RSFCs to prefrontal cortices among subjects with ATSA.
