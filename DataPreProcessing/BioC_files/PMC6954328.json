This hemispheric specificity fits with Craig\u2019s proposal that \u201cthe right and left anterior insulae may be organized asymmetrically in an opponent fashion\u201d (pp. 72)(). More precisely, the homeostatic model Craig sets forth suggests that the left insula is associated with positive, while the right is associated with negative, feelings, which may also explain the left lateralized connectivity findings discussed above. The opposing roles of the right and left insula in the present study fit with this model yet needs further confirmation because the specific influence of the left vAI was just below significance and both regions exhibited a weaker effect than the rACC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26444, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are limitations to this study requiring comment. First, the sample size limits the ability to fully test the impact of sex differences. However, within the current sample there was no effect of sex. No differences were noted between men and women in any of the craving or brain cue-reactivity measures assessed. Including sex in the model did not change the influence of baseline craving on cue-reactivity nor the influence of brain reactivity to smoking cues on the subsequent change in craving. A future, larger study should be conducted to determine if this null effect extends beyond the current sample as well as to verify the current findings. Second, despite the relationships revealed by the analyses, a direct causal influence of AI connectivity on craving and cue-reactivity needs to be tested and related to treatment outcome. Third, no data were collected from controls making it necessary for future work to explore whether there are group differences between smokers and non-smokers in addition to the relationships currently identified. Finally, while all significant values below 0.05 are provided for the imaging regression data, some findings are clearly stronger than others suggesting that the weaker values be taken with more caution.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27706, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The results of the present study document a brain-based distinction between baseline craving and cue-reactivity. Specifically, it is shown that the AI can be subdivided along the ventral/dorsal axis into two functional networks linked with an internal and external focus respectively. This distinction is further supported by the finding that stronger connectivity of the internal-vAI network relates to internally generated baseline craving while smoking cue-reactivity is associated with greater connectivity of the external-dAI network. This conceptual framework of networks being involved in internal/external processes theoretically maps on well to other areas of neuroscience research, suggesting a common theme across neuropsychiatric disorders. The discovery of these relationships advances the basic neuroscientific understanding of nicotine dependence, which may guide the development of more targeted therapies that address both the internal and external factors contributing to continued nicotine use. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in asthmatic patients reduces connectivity between the left vAI and the rACC. It is intriguing to posit that such strategies, which modulate functional connectivity in targeted regions, would be useful in nicotine dependence; further research is needed to determine if this would indeed be a valid approach to develop neuroscience-guided therapeutics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29121, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29144, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
