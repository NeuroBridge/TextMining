The disconnection hypothesis, an early pathophysiological framework conceptualizes the diversity of symptoms as a result of disconnections in neural networks. In line with this hypothesis, previous neuroimaging studies of patients with schizophrenia reported alterations within the default mode network (DMN), the most prominent network at rest. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional connectivity during rest in patients with schizophrenia and with healthy individuals and explore whether observed functional alterations are related to the psychopathology of patients. Therefore, functional magnetic resonance images at rest were recorded of 35 patients with schizophrenia and 41 healthy individuals. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract resting state networks. Comparing ICA results between groups indicated alterations only within the network of the DMN. More explicitly, reduced connectivity in the precuneus was observed in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Connectivity in this area was negatively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms, more specifically with the domain of apathy. Taken together, the current results provide further evidence for a role DMN alterations might play in schizophrenia and especially in negative symptoms such as apathy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1567, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1580, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The diagnostic category of schizophrenia summarizes heterogeneous symptoms that range from so-called positive symptoms, which refer to an excess of function with prominent examples such as hallucinations and delusions, to so-called negative symptoms, which refer to a diminishment of function such as anhedonia, affective blunting, and apathy. Furthermore, a key feature of schizophrenia is an alteration in the subjective experience of a continuous sense of self, which has been argued to account for both positive and negative symptoms. Regarding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, an early and influential hypothesis proposes that core symptoms of schizophrenia can be regarded as dysfunctional interactions between different brain regions rather than pathological changes within localized areas. Furthermore, it has been suggested that these alterations in the connectivity of neural circuits can account for the heterogeneity of symptoms that are associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as they are thought to affect the coordination of mental processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2648, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interactions in the brain can be described by means of complex networks. A neural network, when applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is composed of cortical areas that are functionally connected with each other. Functional connections describe temporal correlations of distributed neural areas. Brain networks are commonly computed on data of individuals who are laying without a specific task instruction in an MRI scanner, a so-called resting-state (rs-fMRI) where the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is measured. Brain networks at rest represent intrinsic or \u201cdefault\u201d brain activity and have been argued to be of fundamental importance for the understanding of the human brain. Although fMRI recordings during the performance of a cognitive task (task-fMRI) are widely used and accepted as a valid tool to investigate neural correlates of specific behaviours, the energy consumption during a task is associated with an increase of less than 5% from the brain\u2019s baseline energy consumption - indicating that the brain is constantly active at rest. Importantly, task and resting state fMRI can be understood as complementary rather than opposing modalities that are focusing on different theoretical and technical aspects: task-fMRI investigates cortical activation sites and rs-fMRI focuses on temporal aspects and correlations among sites to build brain networks. Rs-fMRI may be a promising method to study the pathophysiology of schizophrenia as it is comparatively easy to acquire in a clinical population, it is not affected by differences in task performance that might potentially confound group fMRI analyses, and it has been related to a fundamental aspect of human experience, the sense of self. Previous fMRI studies that investigated functional connectivity during rest in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia report altered neural connectivity. However, the results indicate both increases and decreases in connectivity which might be explained by the various analysis techniques that were used.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4693, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Analysis techniques that are used to calculate functional connectivity (FC) during rest employ measures such as Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, wavelet correlation, mutual information and independent component analysis (ICA) to calculate connectivity between brain areas. For most of these analysis brain areas can either be selected by using all voxels or choosing regions of interest (ROIs) from pre-defined templates. The most popular method is called seed functional connectivity (SeedFC), where ROIs and voxels are considered: typically a ROI (seed) is chosen and the connectivity (using Pearson\u2019s correlation) is calculated between the seed and all voxels in the brain. Brain networks can also be extracted using ICA, which, as opposed to the methods mentioned above, does not rely on parcellation nor on the choice of a seed. ICA is a reliable method borrowed from engineering to extract the brain\u2019s resting state networks. This method blindly recovers source signals from a mixture of sources. One advantage of this method is that it is data-driven and requires no prior assumptions, as is the case for seed-based functional connectivity. Therefore, we used ICA in the present study to investigate differences in the functional connectivity during rest in patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy individuals. ICA can be illustrated by means of the classic cocktail party problem: microphone recordings that contain simultaneous conversations of people can be used to recover individual voices of people by employing the method of ICA. The same principle can be applied to brain signals in rsfMRI \u2013 ICA decomposes the brain\u2019s activity into multiple sources (components). Each component (source) that is retrieved by ICA is a spatial grouping of voxels with temporally coherent activity. Depending on the spatial grouping of voxels, the components are associated with sources that are either related to brain activity or to noise such as movement, blinking, breathing, and heartbeat. The activity-related sources that can be retrieved with ICA \u201cclosely resemble discrete cortical functional networks\u201d. These sources, called resting state networks (RSN), comprise of: default mode (DMN), basal ganglia, auditory, visuospatial, sensory-motor, salience, executive control, language and visual networks. The DMN became the most studied RSN comprising key cortical regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, insula, and inferior parietal cortices. The term \u201cdefault mode\u201d has been coined based on the observation that these brain region exhibit increased and coherent neural activation during resting-state conditions compared to conditions requiring an external attention focus.\u00a0Therefore it is conceptualized as the baseline of brain functioning at rest.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7517, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Rs-fMRI studies employing different methodological approaches have shown various functional alterations in this DMN in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.

In the presented study, the DMN was extracted from a group of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and matched healthy individuals using ICA, a powerful data-driven method to infer connectivity that does not require an a priori definition of regions of interest. In addition, an exploratory analysis was conducted with all remaining resting state networks concomitantly extracted by ICA. Significant group differences were found solely in the DMN. The group comparison revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity in the DMN in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. This result is consistent with two previous studies that employed the same ICA method to investigate rs-fMRI spatial maps and reported decreased functional connectivity within the DMN in patients with schizophrenia and thus supports the dysconnection hypothesis. The present result of decreased connectivity within the DMN also supplements the inconsistent literature of previous ICA studies that observed both decreases and increases, only increases as well as no differences in the spatial maps of the DMN at all. In the context of previous inconclusive findings we would like to emphasize that we included more patients in the reported analysis (N\u2009=\u200935) than previous rs-fMRI studies employing ICA. More specifically, we observed reduced functional connectivity in the precuneus in patients with schizophrenia. This is in line with a previous ICA study where patients with schizophrenia also exhibited decreased connectivity during rest in the precuneus within the DMN as compared to healthy individuals. However, another rs-fMRI ICA study reported both; increased connectivity in the right precuneus and decreased connectivity in the left precuneus but in a smaller group of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Interestingly, the precuneus functions as a central hub within the DMN. Furthermore, we observed that alterations in the functional connectivity of the precuneus in the DMN were negatively related to the severity of negative symptoms. More specifically, we found the avolition-apathy domain to be negatively related to precuneus connectivity in patients. Apathy is a multidimensional syndrome that presents itself as the most common negative symptom of schizophrenia and is also present in other neuropsychiatric diseases and in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Apathy is described as a disorder of motivation with reduced or loss of goal-directed behavior, goal-directed cognitive processes, and emotion. Whereas Andreasen refers to apathy as a decline in energy and drive and thus mainly covers behavioral aspects of apathy in the SANS assessment, Bortolon and colleagues emphasize the multidimensional aspects of apathy. Following the proposal of these authors as well as the diagnostic domains proposed by Robert and colleagues, we calculated in addition to the SANS avolition-apathy score a second apathy score that allows a multidimensional assessment of apathy (see methods). Of note, also the multidimensional apathy score was negatively correlated with the functional connectivity in the precuneus during rest-state further supporting the observed relationship. In sum, the present findings show that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibited reduced functional connectivity in the precuneus of the DMN and that this dysconnectivity was more pronounced in patients with more severe symptoms of apathy, a so-called negative symptom of schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24008, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To our knowledge, we are the first to observe a relationship between reduced functional connectivity in the precuneus and apathy. The precuneus has repeatedly been observed to play a central role in remembering events of one\u2019s personal past, referred to as autobiographical memory, as part of the episodic memory system that is linked to the storage and recollection of events that contain a strong self-refs.\u2009. However, the precuneus is not only involved in remembering one\u2019s past but also in imagining one\u2019s future. Also during episodes of rest when the precuneus becomes activated as a functional hub of the DMN, the human mind engages in self-generated thoughts that relate to past and future events. On a behavioral level previous studies showed impairments in autobiographical memory in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia as well as in generating personal and specific future events. Especially interesting in the light of the current result is the finding that deficits in imagining pleasant future events were found to be linked to symptoms of apathy in individuals with schizophrenia. Raffard and colleagues thus argue that impairments in the capacity to generate future projection of one\u2019s behavior, especially in preferable future situations, might underlie partially the reduced motivation to engage in goal-directed behavior \u2013 as is observed in apathy. In this study we observe that the precuneus that is commonly engaged in future-oriented thoughts shows disconnectivity in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia; and that this dysconnectivity is related to the severity of apathy that is defined as a reduction of goal-directed behavior. We therefore argue that our finding adds support from a neuroscientific perspective to the notion that impairments in future projections might partly underlie motivational decline to engage in goal-directed behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25880, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "However, it is not possible to draw causal inferences based on the reported result as the directionality of this relationship still remains unclear.

As antipsychotic treatment was shown to affect functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia, we addressed this potential confound by calculating and controlling the performed correlation analysis for Chlorpromazine-equivalent (CPZ) (see supplements). Despite the fact that the results remained significant when controlling for CPZ, it would be beneficial for future studies to include antipsychotic-naive patients to exclude medication as a potential confound. A second limitation is that post-hoc correlational analysis with different psychopathology scales might have increased Type I error rates. Therefore, we applied Bonferroni correction for all correlational analysis. A further limitation is that we cannot infer a causal direction of the observed DMN dysconnectivity results, emphasizing the need of future longitudinal studies that investigate functional connectivity during rest over the course of illness.
