Our study found reduced normalized power and alpha reactivity in SZ during the EC resting-state which negatively correlated with PANSS positive scores indicating higher PANSS positive scores were related to lower parietal alpha normalized power.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23363, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Reductions in resting-state alpha oscillations in SZ have been reported previously in MEG studies during EC and EO and with EEG, while the underlying functional significance of these alpha differences is unclear. Patients with schizophrenia may have an intrinsic deficit in the ability to generate alpha band oscillations, as reflected by reduced alpha power at illness onset, similar alpha power deficits in unmedicated and medicated patients and similar alpha band connectivity disruptions between first episode and chronic durations of illness. In the current study, we found reduced alpha spectral power in SZ at both visits across 7 days, with a high reliability/stability of alpha measures between visits (parietal ICCAvg=0.84). There is suggestion the alpha deficit would persist, as EEG alpha spectral power values remained stable over 36 months in adult outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia (parietal ICCs=0.46\u20130.75) and moderately stable over a 9 month period in schizophrenia, bipolar, and nonpsychiatric patients. Although, an EEG study indicated that while SZ may have similar reliability levels as HC, 40% more data may be required to obtain similar levels of artifact-free epochs, if using epoch-rejection to control for artifact contamination. Given that the thalamus plays an important role in generating alpha oscillatory activity in the parietal-occipital areas, reduced alpha power may arise from thalamic dysfunction or tonically enhanced arousal. Alternatively, cortical generators from the parieto-occipital sulcus, visual cortex and/or other visual areas such as the fusiform/lingual gyrus, along with local and global neural organization may be altered in SZ. The neural oscillations recorded with MEG may arise from a mixture of generating processes ranging from local circuitry to large-scale networks; therefore, it is possible that different generators are involved in abnormal alpha oscillations in patients with SZ. Targeting parietal alpha power with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) represents a novel treatment, especially since EEG research has found improvement in patient positive and general psychotic symptoms and alpha power normalization following TMS treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25578, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first MEG test-retest study in participants with schizophrenia. While participants with schizophrenia had excellent reliability in many spectral measures, there were a few instances of lower reliability (i.e. source power across one hour and generally lower one week values), as well as larger 95% CI around ICC estimates indicating greater variability between visits. However, it is unclear what factors may be driving lower reliability in patients. In the current study we monitored several variables such as time of day, PANSS scores, and medication, and found no difference between visits. Additionally, to ensure compliance with the test-retest design, we recruited a stable cohort of patients who successfully completed other neuroimaging studies and were familiar with imaging procedures minimizing anxiety or task unfamiliarity confounds. Prior MEG spectral test-retest studies have been performed exclusively in healthy controls. reported good reliability for power in sensor and source space in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands (ICCs >0.6), with lower reliability in delta and gamma bands in EO. The current study found similar excellent reliability across one week in most regions and bands in HC (ICCs >0.72) with lower reliability in delta band EC (ICCs >0.46). These results suggest that delta measurements may be impacted by environmental and biological noise. While the results between studies are similar, ICC estimates were modeled differently and ICC values will fluctuate based on the model and variance assumptions. Other MEG-derived task specific signals at the sensor and source level have also shown high reliability, particularly, auditory steady-state spectral power [ICCs ~0.61\u20130.82] and phase coherence [ICCs ~0.86\u20130.96], visually induced gamma band oscillations [average ICC=0.861], mismatch negativity amplitude [ICC ~0.81\u20130.90] and peak latency [ICC ~0.74\u20130.88], paired-click auditory gating [ICCs >0.80], N-back working memory M170 response amplitude [ICCs >0.44] and late positive potential [ICCs > 0.93].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27657, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here we found that source functional connectivity reliability based on weighted-phase lag index (ICC=0\u20130.32) was much lower than power spectrum reliability (ICC=0.68\u20130.95). Weighted-phase lag index was used to minimize the impact of volume conduction and zero-lag synchronization, known problems in MEG connectivity analysis; however, it is now clear phase-related connectivity may be poorly suited for test-retest reliability. Prior studies in HC have shown MEG resting-state functional connectivity reliability depends greatly on the frequency band and connectivity measure used, with greatest reliability of phase-locking values in alpha, beta, and gamma bands (averages 0.74\u20130.82), and lowest reliability for phase-lag index in all frequency bands (ICCs<0.1). As suggested by others, connectivity measures should employ correlation between orthogonalized, band-limited, power envelopes, and/or longer epochs and recordings to increase SNR. While phase-based measures have fair repeatability for group-level inference in large datasets, phase-based measures may be noisier estimates in short or noisy recordings, or in smaller studies. Future studies with a larger sample size may find higher reliability of the wpli-debiased measure than reported here, given our small sample size. Furthermore, it remains unknown if the low reliability is due to the FNC measure itself, or the dynamic nature of the brain. Although the current study had a small sample size, we could examine the impact of recording length on reliability. In the current study the longer task (Rest10 vs. Rest4) did not offer significant improvement in wpli connectivity ICC values [HC ICCAvg=0.28, SZ ICCAvg=0.04 for long task vs. HC ICCAvg=0.02, SZ ICCAvg=0.09 for short task].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29408, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although analyzing data in source space minimizes the known issues to field spread and volume conduction that may be present in sensor data, the current study found generally lower reliability values at the source level. Perhaps the lower source reliability may be a reflection of the methods used to attain MEG source constructions (i.e. differences in anatomical versus functional source constructions, or inverse modeling method with MNE dSPM versus beamformer). While other MEG rest studies have used anatomical boundaries to define source regions, grouping time courses based on anatomy may blur functional differences. There have been several recent papers using ICA to define functional regions for connectivity analysis in healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia, however those reports did not address test-retest reliability of ICA driven functional connectivity. Static functional connectivity estimates may also have lower reliability as critical information is lost by time-averaging the signal. Dynamic functional connectivity estimates which take into account the rapidly modulating, dynamic nature of brain states may have better reliability.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30575, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The current study has several limitations which warrant caution. First, this was a stable, medicated cohort of patients and as such it is unknown how well the results will generalize to other populations. Additionally, all SZ were on various antipsychotic medications; therefore, it cannot be determined whether the spectral abnormalities found were due to the disorder or driven by medication. Given the small group size (n=13) there was limited statistical power for investigating gender differences, medication, diagnosis effects, and all-to-all functional connectivity. It is important to keep in mind that test-retest ICCs are variance measures that report relative changes within or between subject variance over time. Even low ICCs do not necessarily imply the measure itself is inaccurate, but perhaps a true within-subject change occurred, or the sample was too homogenous. Although we found that ICC group average value was a bit higher for EC relative to EO in SZ, it is important for future studies to directly test if a particular rest condition (EO or EC) creates meaningfully different results. While we controlled for variables such as nicotine and illicit drug use between sessions, general patterns or alterations in sleep, caffeine intake and/or alcohol use were not monitored. Given that lack of sleep, excess caffeine, or alcohol withdrawal may impact frequency specific ratios or spectral power, ideally these would be monitored between sessions in future studies. Also, it remains to be seen if the lower reliability of delta, especially in orbital regions, may be partially attributed to eye movements that were not eye-blinks. Finally, as a test-retest study this is a single imaging site with a single Elekta Neuromag MEG system; therefore, without a larger sample size, validation on multiple MEG systems and/or multiple sites, definitive conclusions on reliability cannot be made.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32484, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The search for reliable biomarkers in schizophrenia that provide an objective and quantifiable index of network activity is an important avenue of research.
