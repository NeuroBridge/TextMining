Alternate analytical approaches may identify functionally integrated activations or networks related to brain function, and these have been argued to possibly lead to more replicable findings. One such approach is spatial independent component analysis (sICA). sICA is a data-driven approach that can identify brain regions that show spatial patterns of systematic activation or deactivation and may identify overlapping activations and deactivations that cancel in GLM-based analyses. sICA has been proposed to generate findings consistent with brain properties such as balanced excitation/inhibition. sICA has been applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to identify brain networks underlying specific processes like cognitive control, response inhibition, attention, and reward/loss processing. For these reasons, we believe sICA is well suited to identify brain networks associated with spiritual experiences.

While multiple studies report a right-hemisphere-dominant VAN, some attentional tasks including those that involve particularly rare stimuli have implicated a bilateral network. In a task that involves responding to a visual stimulus after a predictive spatial cue is provided, a separate dorsal attention network (DAN) is implicated when the stimulus location is precued, while the VAN becomes active when stimuli appear outside the previously cued area of focus. These two primary attention networks may interact in a dynamic fashion. The DAN in a top-down fashion may inhibit pathways between the VAN and incoming sensory and perceptual information, which may effectively filter out unintended information. When an unexpected but personally relevant stimulus comes into one\u2019s field of perception, this inhibitory filter may be released, giving way to VAN-mediated bottom-up, stimulus-driven, and involuntary attentional processes. That the observed pattern of engagement of the VAN, and not the DAN, is associated with the spiritual condition and not the other two conditions suggests that spiritual experiences, which James once described as \u201cintense, voluminous, or sudden\u201d may involve attentional processes that occur outside of one\u2019s voluntary control. Speculatively, this association may reflect the often unanticipated but personally meaningful nature of spiritual experiences. By extension and also speculatively, this finding suggests that neural networks underlying attentional processes may be important in the role of spirituality in recovery processes in behavioral addictions like gambling and gaming disorders.

Activations of both frontal and temporal lobes including middle and superior temporal gyri as well as the superior frontal gyrus and anterior insula have been related to bonding with intimate others, such as mothers and romantic partners. Taken together, the frontotemporal network engagement in the context of the literature raises the possibility, albeit speculatively, that a feeling of relational intimacy may accompany spiritual states.

As a component of the default mode network and a hub with dense anatomical connections to multiple regions in the brain, the PCC has been implicated in multiple processes involving a self-referential component. For example, the PCC is involved in activities ranging from self-evaluations to autobiographical memories to dealing with moral dilemmas involving oneself, and PCC deactivation has been correlated with tasks that involve focused, present-oriented attention beyond one\u2019s sense of self. In behavioral and substance addictions, PCC activation has been linked to reward-related and craving processes. For these reasons, the PCC has been proposed as a neural target for addictions, especially for meditation and mindfulness-based interventions targeting stress reduction. As we have found that measures of spirituality relate inversely to stress-related activations in largely subcortical regions including the striatum and thalamus, the findings taken together suggest important roles for both cortical and subcortical processes in the beneficial effects of spirituality as well as potential neural targets in spirituality-related interventions for addictions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25871, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Consistent with our hypothesis, the IPL also demonstrated a concurrent negative signal.

Reduced activity in the IPL has also been linked to a reduction in perceived distinction between self and other as well as a reduced sense of agency. Thus, these regional deactivations are consistent with the notion that perceptual changes occur. More specifically, identification with one\u2019s physical self-sense may become more relaxed while, simultaneously, perceived boundaries between self and other may become more diffuse.

Saver and Rabin previously proposed that subcortical limbic regions are responsible for salient aspects of spiritual experiences including a sense of unity and feelings of ecstasy. That dorsal striatal and not ventral striatal regions were implicated in this study suggests that people may seek these experiences not because of an anticipated reward but rather from an intrinsically motivated state, possibly reinforced through previous positive experiences. Given the role of the dorsal striatum in other processes (e.g.,\u00a0habits) and overlap with regions of the striatum implicated in reward processing, alternate interpretations exist and warrant direct examination in future studies.

Furthermore, in contrast to our findings on spiritual states, volitional practices like focused attention and open-monitoring meditations activate neural regions involved in enhancing attentional control, particularly the ACC. The ACC monitors multiple channels of information and enables voluntary executive control of attention.

Such work could be extended to understanding how 12-step programs promote recovery and how mindfulness-based practice may promote health. As spirituality may mitigate against stress-related illnesses and stress has been linked to drug and behavioral addictions, including at neural levels, direct examination of how spirituality may prevent substance and behavioral addictions and operate through the reduction of stress should be conducted.
