Imaging studies of individuals with SZ show hyperactivation of the default mode network (DMN) and the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Studies in SZ show DMN hyperconnectivity and reduced anticorrelation between DMN and the central executive network (CEN). DMN hyperconnectivity has been associated with positive symptoms such as AHs while reduced DMN anticorrelations with cognitive impairment. Using real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NFB) we trained SZ patients to modulate DMN and CEN networks. Meditation is effective in reducing AHs in SZ and to modulate brain network integration and increase DMN anticorrelations. Consequently, patients were provided with meditation strategies to enhance their abilities to modulate DMN/CEN. Results show a reduction of DMN hyperconnectivity and increase in DMN-CEN anticorrelation. Furthermore, the change in individual DMN connectivity significantly correlated with reductions in AHs. This is the first time that meditation enhanced through rt-fMRI-NFB is used to reduce AHs in SZ. Moreover, it provides the first empirical evidence for a direct causal relation between meditation enhanced rt-fMRI-NFB modulation of DMN-CEN activity and post-intervention modulation of resting state networks ensuing in reductions in frequency and severity of AHs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1606, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1619, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The overarching hypothesis adopted in the study was that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia (SZ) are a product of the network of brain regions whose abnormalities jointly contribute to auditory hallucinations (AHs) (discussed in greater detail in Part I). Thus, if AHs are indeed the effect of a network-based abnormality, one would expect that the manipulation of any region within this network should modulate AHs. In Part I of our paper, we reported that manipulation of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) reduces AHs. This account is now complemented by Part II of the paper, where we report on the results of a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback session which targeted default mode network (DMN) and central executive network (CEN) connectivity. The expectation here was that similarly to rt-fMRI neurofeedback session focused on the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the DMN-CEN neurofeedback approach would also result in both brain and clinical changes. Unlike in the STG focused rt-fMRI neurofeedback study discussed in Part I where we aimed at blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal change in the STG post-NF, here we focused on the pre-to-post changes in resting state network functional connectivity (rsFC).

The processing associated with these tasks converges on a key brain region, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) (see for reviews). In addition, as discussed below, MPFC belongs to the DMN network whose abnormalities have been prominently associated with positive symptoms in SZ. Another region found involved in self-other distinctions by interacting with MPFC is the STG (see for reviews). While the STG role in self-referential thinking has been well established, it is also primarily responsible for auditory perception and speech analysis.

In contrast, performing cognitive tasks leads to suppression of the DMN activation. Furthermore, greater suppression of the DMN is associated with better memory formation, fewer lapses of attention, better learning of cognitive skills and less mind wandering.

We believe that the current findings support the use of \u2018mental noting\u2019, enhanced by real time fMRI feedback, as a complementary treatment of AHs in SZ patients.

Furthermore, the control condition using the SMC as a target region was not the standard sham condition where the task is identical but the feedback region varies, due to concerns related to our patients wellbeing as described in Part I. Thus, the question of the effects of meditation relative to meditation aided with NFB, tested head to head in one subject group, was not addressed in the current design: we plan to address it in a future study. The current study has been designed as a proof of concept study since at the time of the study design there was no evidence that neurofeedback can be used to reduce AHs in schizophrenia. The results obtained in this study where one session of NFB aided by meditation was sufficient to produce significant AVH reductions, nicely dovetail with a study by. In that study, three weeks of mindful meditation by itself, practiced daily, were needed to achieve significant reductions in AVH. Together, these results encourage us to think that neurofeedback and meditation jointly are effective means of achieving desired neural and clinical changes. It is currently not clear what factors contributed to the slow rate of AHs reductions observed in the Sheng et al study. However, schizophrenia is associated with reductions in self-awareness, introspection and metacognitive abilities. These deficits may have contributed to the slow rate of improvement when meditation only was used as a therapeutic approach. Thus, feedback from the appropriate brain regions may aid in achieving therapeutic treatment goals in this patient group. At the very least, the results obtained in the current study suggest that NFB from the brain regions involved in meditation contributes to effects that can be observed after just one NFB session.

We further hypothesized that the rt\u2013fMRI neurofeedback intervention would lead to a reduction in AHs. We adopted two different approaches to test this hypothesis. In Part I of the paper we narrowly focused on the STG BOLD activation changes and showed that reducing the STG activation in the task of ignoring all sounds was associated with AHs reduction. In Part II of the paper, we explicitly focused on AHs network\u2013wide connectivity in a task that targeted DMN\u2013CEN differential activations. This approach resulted in network\u2013wide connectivity changes accompanied by reduction in AHs. Furthermore, individual subjects\u2019 \u0394DMN\u2013STG connectivity was correlated with individuals \u0394AHs in post\u2013 relative to pre\u2013rt\u2013fMRI neurofeedback comparisons. Thus, targeting both the STG and targeting a network\u2013wide connectivity was associated with AH reductions. These results support the hypothesis put forth (:) in this investigation that perturbing one element of the brain network is going to impact all elements of this network. Further support for this perspective comes from recently published studies of rt-fMRI neuro feedback where AHs reductions were associated with changes belonging to AHs network rather than pertaining to the target region for neurofeedback, as described above.
