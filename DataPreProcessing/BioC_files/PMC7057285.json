The present study investigated gray matter (GM) volume differences between 19 opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) patients and 20 healthy controls using magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. Associations of GM volumes with subjective feelings of exclusion and inclusion during a social ostracism (Cyberball) paradigm, with rejection sensitivity, social interaction anxiety and social phobia were explored. OMT patients displayed smaller GM volume in the bilateral insula and inferior frontal gyri. Psychometric and task data showed that patients reported significantly higher rejection sensitivity, social anxiety and social phobia scores and felt more excluded and less included during the social ostracism paradigm. Smaller GM volume in the insula was associated with higher subjective exclusion, lower subjective inclusion and higher rejection sensitivity, social anxiety and social phobia scores. Findings indicate that structural deficits in emotion- and anxiety-processing brain regions in OMT patients are associated with increased social rejection sensitivity. As social rejection is a potential trigger for relapse, patients might benefit from therapeutic strategies that promote social integration.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1611, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1624, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Opioid dependence is a chronic disease that is associated with social and physical impairments. Aside from cognitive dysfunction, opioid dependence is associated with changes in emotion processing and higher rates of depressive symptoms. The underpinnings of those alterations are not fully understood, but studies indicate that, in part, constant negative social feedback might shape emotionality in patients toward a negative affective state and a higher rejection sensitivity. Studies have shown that peer rejection contributes to latter social rejection sensitivity and increased social anxiety and withdrawal. Further studies confirmed the association between social rejection sensitivity and social anxiety. Importantly, negative social interaction and poor social support are associated with negative treatment outcome in opioid-dependent patients. Attention has been drawn to the relevance of social context in addictive disorders with the insula being implicated as a key hub processing social inclusion and exclusion and drug craving. Neuroimaging studies have identified structural deficits in patients on opioid maintenance therapy (OMT) in the insula and other areas associated with cognitive performance, emotion processing and social perception: Previous anatomical studies reported smaller gray matter (GM) volume in opioid-dependent patients in the bilateral insular gyrus; areas of the frontal lobe, such as the bilateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal cortex, and supplementary motor cortex; areas of the temporal lobe and thalamus; and right cerebellum. It was hypothesized that these structural abnormalities result in behavioral and neuropsychological impairments. However, there is still little evidence on the association between structural changes and behavioral correlates. The study by) investigated associations between GM volume changes and cognitive performance, as well as depressive symptoms and anxiety: While OMT patients showed little to no impairments with regard to memory performance, executive function and visual construction skills, significantly higher depression and anxiety scores were found that showed significant associations to smaller volume in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate, cerebellum and insula. It has been suggested that heroin-induced changes in regional cerebral blood flow with a resulting reduced perfusion of brain regions, in addition to an altered brain metabolism, might be the underlying cause for structural abnormalities in opioid-dependent patients. In addition, the duration of heroin use has been suggested to be a critical factor for the extent of brain damage. However, the impact of structural abnormalities on social perception remains to be elucidated.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4358, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present analyses were performed on a dataset that was collected within the framework of a larger study that used psychometric assessment tools, an funtional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) social ostracism Cyberball task and structural MRI to investigate functional and structural brain correlates of social interaction and social rejection. The results of the social rejection functional correlates are reported in detail elsewhere. In short, results showed that patients on OMT felt less included and more excluded during fMRI Cyberball inclusion and control conditions and equally excluded during the social exclusion Cyberball condition. Furthermore, patients showed reduced pain sensitivity, but subjective pain was higher after social exclusion compared to social inclusion trials. When contrasting social exclusion and inclusion trials, healthy participants displayed significant activation in brain areas related to social feedback and emotion processing, whereas OMT patients showed no difference across conditions probably due to direct pharmacological inhibitory effects of the opioids.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5462, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Incremental to the previous publication, here we report data on the structural correlates of social anxiety and social rejection sensitivity.

The healthy control group consisted of volunteers that were recruited from newspaper and clinic homepage advertisement. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed written consent was obtained. All participants were required to be aged between 18 and 65\u00a0years. Opioid-dependent patients had to meet the diagnosis of opioid dependence according to the ICD10. Healthy participants were included only if no indication of substance abuse disorder or another mental illness was found during an interview with an experienced clinical psychiatrist. Exclusion criteria for both groups were: (i) substance use disorder other than nicotine (only for healthy controls), (ii) pregnancy, (iii) severe internal or neurological condition and (iv) contraindications for MRI scanning (e.g. tattoos, metal implants, pregnancy, pacemakers). A total of 25 patients and 22 healthy controls were included in the current study. 19 patients (18 males and 1 female) and 20 controls (18 males and 2 females) provided complete VBM datasets of sufficient quality. Patients did not undergo a formal screening for comorbid psychiatric disorders prior to being included in the current study; however, all patients were interviewed by two independent professional psychiatrists at the institute, in order to rule out relevant comorbid psychiatric diseases. In addition, patients were treated at the department\u2019s opioid maintenance unit for several years with regular appointments with a specialized psychiatrist once a week and no clinical evidence for a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Patients were all HIV negative, but four were tested positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.

Current methodological studies indicated that the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12, http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/index.html) for SPM12 provides a more accurate volumetric analysis of brain regions and is more robust and accurate against volumetric alterations than the VBM8 toolbox. Considering these findings, we performed our VBM analyses using the CAT12 toolbox for SPM12, applying the default settings and proceeding according to the authors\u2019 manual. Before image analyses, all image datasets were inspected by at least one medical technical radiology assistant to check for any gross structural abnormalities or imaging artifacts and referred to a neuroradiologist if necessary. All 3D T1-weighted MRI scans were normalized using an affine registration followed by non-linear registration, corrected for bias field inhomogeneity and then segmented into GM, white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid components. We used the Diffeomorphic Anatomic Registration Through Exponentiated Lie (DARTEL) algebra algorithm to normalize the segmented scans into a standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Compared to the conventional algorithm, the DARTEL approach provides more precise spatial normalization to the template than standard registration methods. Following this step, images were visually inspected for sample homogeneity of the unsmoothed data. This was evaluated using the procedure included in the CAT12 toolbox. Mahalanobis distance, combining the mean correlation and weighted overall image quality were inspected and outliers (>2 standard deviations) excluded from further analyses (n\u2009=\u20093). The remaining segmented, modulated and normalized datasets were smoothed using an 8 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian smoothing kernel and then fed into second-level two-sample t-test analyses, considering total intracranial volume (TIV) and age as covariates. In order to control for multiple comparisons, a combined cluster-extent and voxel-wise threshold, corresponding to a family-wise error (FWE) rate of pFWE <0.05, was determined using the AlphaSim module of the NeuroElf toolbox (www.neuroelf.net) for Matlab. For a pre-set voxel-wise threshold of P\u2009<\u20090.001, the AlphaSim procedure determined a cluster-extent threshold of 103 voxels (10.000 Monte Carlo simulations, smoothing kernel of x\u2009=\u20098\u00a0mm, y\u2009=\u20098\u00a0mm, z\u2009=\u20098\u00a0mm). In order to follow up on the results of the whole-brain analyses, standardized anatomical masks were used to extract GM volume data from the respective brain regions that showed significant group effects (contrast: healthy participants > OMT patients). The masks that defined the regions of interest (ROI) were derived from the Hammers brain atlas. Specifically, GM volume data were extracted from the (i) left insula [BA13], (ii) right insula [BA13], (iii) left inferior frontal gyrus [BA47] and (iv) right inferior frontal gyrus [BA47] using the standard procedure of the CAT12 toolbox for GM volume data extraction from ROIs.

A recent meta-analysis, investigating the role of different brain structures in interoception, emotion processing and social cognition, confirmed the role of the bilateral anterior insula (BA13) in emotion processing and interoception. Further, specifically the left insula seems to be involved in social cognition. The study by Adolfi and colleagues also indicated a contribution of the bilateral inferior frontal gyri (BA47) to social cognition and emotion processing, while no robust evidence was found for a role of this region in processing interoceptive information. This suggests that specifically the left insula is a hub where social, interoceptive and emotional perceptive components are processed. Further meta-analyses of fMRI data on social rejection confirmed the insula as one of three regions that was reliably recruited during experimental induction of social exclusion, in addition to the inferior frontal cortex and the left anterior cingulate cortex. Further studies supported the involvement of the insula in the processing of social rejection. The prominent role of the insula is further underlined by its extensive connections to other brain areas. Specifically, the insula shows strong connections to ventral parts of the striatum. Greater anatomical connection strength between both areas (measured using MRI-based tractography) was related to less-risky gambling choices, stressing the role of the insula and its connections to addictive behavior. Further, the anterior insula is reciprocally connected with the amygdala, and it has been suggested that these connections might link social stress and drug seeking.) proposed that the insula and connected brain circuits might be neural substrates for a social \u2018spiral of distress\u2019. The correlations between insula GM volume and specifically the left insula GM volume with subjective feelings of exclusion during a social ostracism Cyberball task, as well as social interaction anxiety scores, social phobia symptoms and, importantly, social rejection sensitivity, support the role of the insula as part of the neural basis of social rejection sensitivity and processing of negative social feedback. Previous studies also reported reduced GM volume in patients with social anxiety, supporting the idea that a loss of insula GM volume might play a role in social anxiety. The relevance of structural changes in the insula in OMT patients is further supported by evidence that demonstrates an association between negative social interaction and relapse risk in heroin addiction. The GM volume deficits in the insula and inferior frontal gyrus in the current patient sample might therefore influence social interaction and emotion processing and render OMT patients more vulnerable to psychosocial stressors and subsequent relapse.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27644, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The observation of a significant intercorrelation between the psychometric scales and associations with the extent of task-induced subjective feelings of exclusion during social ostracism task indicate that the different psychometric scales (SPS, SIAS, RSQ, BSI) and the social ostracism task measure, at least in part, a common construct. Previous research investigated whether the intercorrelation between SPS and SIAS and other scales measuring anxiety and depressive symptoms reflect a measure of \u2018general emotional distress\u2019 or if high levels of \u2018fear of negative evaluation\u2019 mediate the associations (the latter was measured using the specific \u2018Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale\u2019 (FNES). The results indicated that when the effects of the general emotional distress measures were controlled, FNES remained a significant predictor of both SPS and SIAS scores. This suggests that fear of negative evaluation might be an underlying construct of the associations between anxiety symptoms and social rejection sensitivity. Longitudinal studies also confirmed that social rejection sensitivity was associated with social anxiety and social withdrawal. While social anxiety and social rejection seem to be interconnected and both contribute to subjective experience of loneliness and dysfunctional social interaction patterns, it has been suggested that social rejection sensitivity is qualitatively different from social anxiety.

Importantly, heroin, but not methadone, has been associated with such unfavorable changes in perfusion, measured using brain spectroscopy and transcranial sonography, and brain metabolism, suggesting that OMT might not contribute to the progress of impairments. In contrast, studies suggested that patients that remained on stable OMT without relapse to heroin showed an amelioration of structural abnormalities in the superior frontal gyrus, while differences in the middle frontal gyrus, occipital gyrus and cingulate persisted. However, it should be noted that a study in Asian population investigating former heroin-dependent individuals (mean heroin use 20.43\u00a0years) without OMT that were in drug rehabilitation and remained abstinent for 5 months from any drugs still showed GM volume deficits in the insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Importantly, structural deficits were replicated in opioid-dependent patients with no concurrent use of other psychoactive substances. This suggests that current or past use of psychoactive substances other than heroine might not be the only relevant factor contributing to GM differences. This is corroborated by the data of our study that show no differences between groups with or without current use of psychoactive substances. Furthermore, differences in social anxiety scores, higher social phobia scores and increased rejection sensitivity could not be explained by absence or presence of comorbid substance consumption. Based on previous literature, we speculate that the frequent experience of stigmatization and social rejection in OMT patients might have fostered negative expectations and beliefs regarding social interactions and might have triggered social anxiety and social phobia. Additionally, current results may implicate that GM volume differences in limbic brain areas might also contribute to an increased social anxiety, social phobia and rejection sensitivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31465, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31477, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Current data do not allow statements about the chronology and causality of the development of opioid dependence and GM volume deficits. However, based on previous studies that established a negative association between heroin intake and both brain perfusion and brain metabolism, and associations between duration of heroin abuse and extent of GM deficits, it seems likely that heroin consumption contributed to the deficits that were found in the current study. In addition, the temporal connection between social rejection sensitivity and social anxiety and opioid dependence could not be determined based on current data. We speculate that there is a bidirectional interdependency between learning history and structural deficits in OMT patients that cannot be disentangled, based on the correlational design of the current study. Further research is warranted, in order to determine the relative contribution and temporal alignment of both factors. However, even without this information, the association between the extent of social rejection sensitivity and GM volume reductions in brain regions that are prominently involved in social cognition and emotion processing seems relevant and should be considered in treatment. A limitation of the current study is the small sample size that might have limited the possibility to detect smaller effects (e.g. associations between right insula GM volume and social perception). Additionally, the consideration of education level (which could be regarded as proxy for the socioeconomic status) as covariate in the group comparisons of psychometric data rendered some of the group differences on the SIAS, SPS, RSQ and BSI scales insignificant. This suggests that socioeconomic factors contribute significantly to the observed differences between patients and controls. This suggests that not patient status per se determines the extent of social rejection sensitivity and anxiety but that socioeconomic status\u2014independent of group\u2014might account for a relevant proportion of the inter-individual differences. While inferences should be drawn very carefully, the finding points toward the relevance of therapeutic strategies that aim at social rehabilitation of patients, which might contribute to an amelioration of social rejection sensitivity and social anxiety. The control of current partnership status in the group comparisons did not change the significance of most results (RSQ, SPS, BSI) with the exception of the SIAS scale that did not show significant difference after controlling for partnership status. While the current sample showed a relevant consumption of substances other than methadone and buprenorphine (e.g. benzodiazepines), the replication of GM volume deficits in brain areas that were implicated by recent meta-analyses (e.g. insula and inferior frontal gyrus) and the fact that statistical correction of concurrent substance use did not change significance of these results support the notion that the current sample might still reflect a representative sample of OMT patients. Some patients presented with positive HCV antibodies. Previous studies showed that HCV-infected patients displayed GM atrophy in the bilateral insula and thalamus and increasing atrophy over a 7-year follow-up in the left amygdala and left parahippocampal regions. While we cannot rule out the possibility that HCV infection might have contributed to smaller GM volume in the OMT patient sample, exploratory two-sample t-test did not show a significant effect of HCV antibody status on any GM volume measure. Additionally, all patients that were included in the current analyses did not present with suprathreshold HCV load at the time of the experiment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35185, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35196, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, current data show GM volume reductions in the bilateral insulae and bilateral inferior frontal gyri in OMT patients.

As negative social interaction is a potential trigger for relapse, this is a relevant finding, and patients might benefit from therapeutic strategies that aim at enhancing social coping skills by means of how to cope with negative social feedback.
