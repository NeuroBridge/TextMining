In the United States, recent data suggest an increasing trend in prenatal past-month illicit drug, tobacco product, and alcohol use from 2016 to 2017. Even for women able to abstain from substance use during pregnancy, most relapse within two years postpartum. Substance use during pregnancy may exert teratogenic effects on fetal development and neonatal complications upon delivery. Postpartum maternal substance use may also detrimentally impact child development. Substance-using mothers evidence less maternal sensitivity during interactions with their children as compared to non-substance-using mothers, interactions which can be marked by maternal disengagement as well as intrusiveness. Indeed, parental substance use is positively associated with child maltreatment and child welfare cases. Critically, disrupted maternal care, specifically in the context of addiction, may increase children\u2019s vulnerability for later substance use, abuse, and dependence, laying the foundation for the intergenerational transmission of addiction.

This approach provides insight into the neural mechanisms that may mediate optimal caregiving and suggest new directions for interventions to support parents in their caregiving role. In particular, given the typically positively valenced nature of mother-infant interactions, attention has been focused on regions implicated in reward processing at cortical (e.g., prefrontal cortex, PFC) and subcortical (e.g., striatum) levels, particularly when mothers view photographs of their own infant\u2019s emotional facial expressions. For instance, in non-substance-using mothers, viewing their own infant\u2019s face, as compared to an unknown infant\u2019s face, multiple brain regions are activated, including the striatum, substantia nigra, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and insula. Similarly, when listening to infant vocalizations, parents can be distinguished from non-parents by brain activation in the amygdala, ventral PFC, and insula, regions implicated in cognition and emotion. Thus, accumulating research indicates encoding of maternal responsiveness by corticolimbic brain regions. However, brain regions engaged by these affective infant cues, particularly those implicated in reward and stress reactivity and regulation (e.g., ventral striatum, PFC, amygdala), are also affected by addiction.

These latter studies have employed cry recordings longer in duration than the two-second cries employed here, perhaps explaining this discrepancy. Thus, our null findings of maternal substance-use status and familiarity may in part be attributable to these differences in cry parameters. That being said, it is worth noting differences in self-reported measures of cries that occurred after the scanning protocol wherein substance-using mothers rated the cry stimuli (own and unknown) as less sad and distressed than non-substance-using mothers. Furthermore, across the sample, mothers rated their own infant\u2019s cries as sadder and more distressed than the unknown infant\u2019s cries. Therefore, at a self-report level, maternal substance-use and familiarity effects emerge, but we do not see this same distinction at the level of neural function. This divergence in brain and behavioral measures might reflect a response bias, a limitation of subjective measures, or a decrease in salience in response to repeated exposure to the cries across the scanning protocol.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27820, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The strengths of our study included the well-characterized sample of substance-using and non-substance-using mothers and our simultaneous assessment of infant face and infant cry familiarity effects. However, important limitations and directions for future research should be noted. Importantly, this was a cross-sectional design, preventing causal inference regarding the potential impact of maternal substance use on neural responses to infant affective cues. Instead these findings are best viewed as associations between mothers with and without current substance use and their neural response to infant cues, rather than as evidence of substance use leading to changing neural responses to infant cues. Furthermore, there may be other factors that co-occur with substance use that might be associated with neuroanatomical and functional differences in neural responses to infant affective cues, such as differences in attachment or unresolved trauma. This warrants further investigation in future research \u2013 both within the substance-using group and in comparison with the non-substance-using group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28925, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In contrast to our hypothesis, our findings were not consistent with prior work which evidenced that when substance-using mothers viewed their own infant\u2019s happy face, relative to an unknown infant, there was decreased activation in the ventromedial PFC, hypothalamus, and ventral striatum. There may be two reasons for these differences. The first reflects differences between the maternal samples; the current study employed poly-substance-using mothers living in the community with only 7 women reporting receiving current substance-use treatment. In contrast, all mothers were receiving inpatient treatment for substance-use disorders in the study by. Secondly, we examined data collected across at least four functional runs in our maternal sample, whereas prior work examined functional data from only two runs.

Despite this limitation, it is important to note that, among substance-using mothers, polysubstance use (as opposed to limited use of only one substance) is common (e.g.,). In addition, while inconsistencies across studies of maternal substance use may relate to differences in substance use across samples, they may also reflect the absence of stability in responding to infant affective cues, which may vary at a within-subjects level, as well as at a group level, when considering the maternal substance-using group. Such variability may present as decreased reactivity (consistent with, and) as well as the increased reactivity observed here. This interpretation is consistent with behavioral studies demonstrating associations between substance use and mother-child interactions. Namely, past research has demonstrated that, while substance-using mothers may be passive and disengaged during their interactions with their child (e.g.,), they may also be hostile and intrusive (e.g.,). Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that variability in reactivity to infant affective cues (with respect to brain function or behavior) associated with maternal substance use may reflect differing points in the cycle of addiction, which warrant concurrent measurement and/or explicit manipulation (e.g., through completing experimental protocols during abstinent and satiated states) in future research. This work will be advanced by examining maternal brain function and behavior within the same session to more adequately inform whether changing neural responses to infant cues may translate to maternal behavior and child outcomes. Furthermore, as this work continues, it will also be important to address whether differential patterns of maternal brain activity (and behavior) vary as a function of the experimental context and/or task demands.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31898, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, this is one of the first studies to examine how mothers with and without substance use respond to cues from own and unknown infants and of varying affective states. Our findings suggest overlapping cortical and subcortical (e.g., striatal) brain regions are involved in responding to infant faces, and responses are influenced by infant familiarity, emotional expression, and maternal substance-use status. These findings advance our understanding of the neurobiology of parenting and addiction and highlight the need to more explicitly include in theoretical models and in empirical research increased reactivity to salient infant affective cues, in addition to attenuated neural responses, which are often the focus of this work.
