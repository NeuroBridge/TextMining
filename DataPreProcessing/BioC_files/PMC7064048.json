BDNF is a neurotrophin that mediates neuroplasticity and the formation, survival, and differentiation of neurons in the brain through interactions with the tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor and several signaling cascades. In rodents, acute alcohol administration increases BDNF messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, whereas prolonged excessive alcohol intake reduces BDNF, particularly in the amygdala, striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Studies have also shown that haplodeficient BDNF and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) responsive-element binding protein mice showing about 50% lower BDNF levels have an increased preference for alcohol and display exaggerated anxiety-like behaviors. Inhibition of BDNF expression in the central nucleus of amygdala via administration of BDNF antisense oligodeoxynucleotides increases both alcohol consumption and anxiety, which can be rescued by subsequent BDNF co-infusion. It has therefore been suggested that decreased BDNF levels in the amygdala are involved in regulating anxiety and alcohol consumption.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5071, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "With regard to clinical models, our recent study using human postmortem amygdala found that individuals with early onset-AUD (i.e., onset prior to age 21 years) but not late-onset AUD (i.e., onset after age 21 years) exhibited an upregulation of BDNF antisense and a decrease in amygdala BDNF expression relative to control participants. No other studies to our knowledge have directly measured BDNF levels in the human amygdala, although fortunately, peripheral measures of BDNF have been shown to correlate with brain levels in rodents; thus, it is purported that BDNF measured via serum or plasma reflects (to some extent) central BDNF activity. To date, numerous studies have tested differences in serum and/or plasma BDNF levels between individuals with and without AUD and have shown that AUD is associated with both increased BDNF and decreased BDNF compared with controls. An even larger set of studies showed no association between BDNF and AUD diagnoses. These discrepant findings are likely related to the fact that AUD is a heterogeneous diagnosis that can include varying symptom combinations and patterns of drinking behavior. More robust and consistent associations with BDNF may therefore be found at the level of individual differences, particularly biologically based individual differences. As has been discussed extensively in the field of genetics, the identification of intermediate biological phenotypes that serve as a link between molecular variables and human behavior may be a way to reduce heterogeneity and improve our understanding of the role of BDNF in AUD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6661, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "BDNF promotes synaptic plasticity and connectivity in the brain. Therefore, neural reactivity and functional connectivity measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be an important individual difference factor in humans that acts transiently and is associated with both BDNF levels and drinking behaviors. Indeed, a functional polymorphism in the BDNF gene, specifically, the valine-to-methionine substitution at codon 66 (Val66Met), is associated with alterations in functional connectivity within several large-scale neural networks during resting state and emotion processing. More broadly, Val66Met is associated with reductions in gray matter in memory and emotion regions, exaggerated limbic activation to negative stimuli, and deficits in cognitive function. There has been only 1 prior study to our knowledge that has investigated the impact of peripheral BDNF, measured in blood plasma, on functional connectivity associating increased levels of plasma BDNF with increased resting-state connectivity between motor areas in healthy older adults. Together these data highlight BDNF\u2019s key role in neural function; however, no study to date has specifically examined the association between peripheral measures of BDNF and amygdalar functioning in humans despite the plethora of animal studies demonstrating the impact of BDNF levels in the amygdala on alcohol consumption and anxiety-like behaviors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8086, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The broader human neuroimaging literature clearly indicates that anxiety and alcohol abuse are associated with abnormalities in amygdala-based neural networks.

Decreased amygdala-PFC connectivity at rest has also been shown to longitudinally predict increases in alcohol use in adolescents.
