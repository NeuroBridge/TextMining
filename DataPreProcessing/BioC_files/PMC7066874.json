During adolescence, there is pruning of dopamine receptors in reward-related areas of the brain, such as the ventral striatum (VS). These neurodevelopmental changes are thought to be important for understanding the neural underpinnings of reward-driven behavior and risk for alcohol misuse, especially because drugs of abuse enhance dopamine neurotransmission. Thus, adolescence is thought to be a time when the brain may be particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. Animal research supports this hypothesis, showing that the effects of alcohol on behavioral and cognitive functioning, as well as brain structure, are more pronounced during adolescence relative to adulthood. In humans, cross-sectional fMRI studies also document differences in the reactivity of reward-related neural systems among adolescents with AUD relative to healthy controls.

These findings highlight a mechanistic neural pathway through which greater adolescent alcohol use is associated with reward responsivity at age 20, leading to risk for persistent, clinically-significant AUD symptoms at age 22, a time of heightened vulnerability for AUD development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23247, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Consistent with prior findings from community samples, we found escalation in alcohol consumption across adolescence within an urban, low-income male sample, a group known to be at risk for AUD. Greater escalation in rate of adolescent alcohol use was related to brain reward-related functioning during the period of emerging adulthood involving ongoing brain maturation. Results are consistent with animal findings suggesting that adolescent drinking primes the brain for alcohol-related psychopathology through increased reward sensitivity. For example, alcohol exposure during adolescence was linked to persistence of an \u201cadolescent-like phenotype\u201d in adult rodents characterized by greater wanting of alcohol. Several receptor systems are thought to underpin increased reward sensitivity to alcohol, including the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor system, expressed in striato-cortical structures, such as the VS. This system undergoes significant developmental change during adolescence, providing a molecular mechanism through which adolescents may experience increased responsiveness to the positive aspects of alcohol. Thus, via changes to NMDA signaling, greater adolescent alcohol exposure may confer hypersensitivity of striato-cortical reward circuits, promoting adolescent-like, impulsive alcohol misuse that continues into adulthood, including AUD symptomatology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24628, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We also found an association between higher VS reactivity to reward anticipation at age 20 and increases in AUD symptom severity from ages 20\u201322. Although neurobiological models of psychopathology emphasize that individual differences in brain reactivity precede changes in symptomatology, only a handful of empirical studies have established such \u201cneuroprediction\u201d pathways, including for depression and criminal recidivism. Our results suggest that hypersensitive reward-related neural reactivity represents a predictive biomarker of risk for AUD. At the same time, caution is warranted as our results do not preclude the possibility that pre-existing neural alterations in reward circuity predisposed individuals to adolescent alcohol misuse or AUD. This possibility is supported by studies of adolescents with a family history of alcoholism who show functional and structural differences in reward circuitry relative to healthy controls prior to alcohol use onset. Although a limitation of this study is that we did not measure parent history of AUD, we did control for the effects of impulsivity and extraversion, which could be proxies for stable biologically-based predispositions for adolescent alcohol use or neural hypersensitivity to reward. Future prospective studies capable of identifying individual differences in reward circuity prior to initiation of alcohol use would help to address these issues. Notably, these issues do not apply to the neuroprediction pathway we established during early adulthood, where VS hypersensitivity to reward at age 20 predicted increases in AUD symptoms at age 22.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26242, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, we found a relationship between adolescent alcohol use and increased VS reactivity to reward anticipation, but not reward receipt. The anticipation phase is associated with appetitive processing, or \u201cwanting\u201d reward, whereas the receipt phase is linked to consumption, or \u201cliking\u201d a gained reward. Our results are consistent with a recent study that used a similar task, reporting increased VS activation during the anticipation of monetary reward among alcohol-dependent adults versus healthy controls. However, findings differ in direction from studies of adult alcoholics, who are typically reported to show reduced VS activation during monetary reward anticipation. Thus, a developmental dissociation may exist, such that adolescent drinking initially primes the brain for increased response to non-substance and substance-associated reward cues. However, following chronic alcohol exposure associated with alcohol dependency, a \u201chijacking\u201d of the reward system via dopaminergic modulation of signals in the VS may occur that \u201cflips\u201d motivational responses specifically to non-substance related rewards.

However, several limitations are worth noting. First, our sample consisted only of males raised in low-income, urban homes. Thus, the findings may not generalize to other populations, particularly women and/or those not living in low-income, urban environments. We focused on males because they are more likely to engage in risky behavior and drug use. However, there are important sex-specific volumetric developmental changes that occur in the VS across adolescence in the VS (cubic for males and linear for females). Accordingly, future studies of sex-balanced samples at risk for AUD are needed to explore potentially sex-specific neural pathways that impact VS reward-related responsivity and differentially increase risk for AUD. Second, the measure we used to assess alcohol and marijuana use across time had a limited frequency range (i.e., 0\u20132), which may have led to an underestimation of effect sizes. Future prospective studies are needed with measures that can more precisely assess alcohol consumption (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test).

In turn, this pathway predicted increases in AUD symptoms during early adulthood. Results provide evidence to support the hypothesis that greater acceleration in adolescent alcohol consumption is related to hypersensitivity of the brain to reward anticipation and in turn, clinically-significant alcohol use, which persists into adulthood.

We estimated latent factors for the intercept (mean starting level), slope (linear change over time), and quadratic slope (nonlinear change over time/acceleration). A quadratic LGCM showed the best fit to the alcohol use data across adolescence: \u03c72=1.52, df=1, p= 22, CFI=.99, RMSEA=.04).

The model shows only significant pathways but we modeled all pathways from predictors to outcomes and within-time covariance (i.e., between all measures at ages 20 and 22; see Supplemental Table 4). We tested whether accelerated adolescent alcohol use was related to AUD symptoms at age 22 via brain reward-related reactivity (Figure 1). The model included a quadratic factor of adolescent alcohol use extracted from LGCM (Figure 2) and three significant peaks that emerged within the anatomic VS ROI from the main effects of the reward task in the left and right VS (Supplemental Figure 1). The main variables of interest are shown in bold text. Covariates and correlated outcomes (i.e., to test specificity and uniqueness of effects) are shown in smaller, italicized, non-emphasized text. Direct paths were examined for statistical significance. Indirect pathways were estimated as the product of the coefficients (\u201cSobel test\u201d) as an index of effect size but we also present bootstrapped CI of the effects. To examine whether VS reward-related reactivity uniquely predicted increases in AUD symptoms at age 22, we controlled for AUD symptoms at age 20. To isolate effects of adolescent alcohol use, we also accounted for symptoms of other drug use disorders and antisocial personality disorder both when the fMRI scan was completed at age 20 and concurrently to the outcome of AUD symptoms at age 22. The model accounted for the effects of race and income.
