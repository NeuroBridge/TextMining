Evidence suggests that the globus pallidus externus (GPe), a substructure within the basal ganglia, participates in inhibitory control processes, as examined in stop-signaling tasks. In fact, studies in rodents have revealed that alcohol can change GPe activity by decreasing neuronal firing rates, suggesting that the GPe may have a central role in explaining impulsive behaviors and failures of inhibition that occur during binge drinking. In this study, twenty-five healthy volunteers underwent intravenous alcohol infusion to achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.08 g/dl, which is equivalent to a binge drinking episode. A resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan was collected prior to the infusion and at binge-level exposure. Functional connectivity analysis was used to investigate the association between alcohol-induced changes in GPe connectivity, drinking behaviors, and impulsivity traits. We found that individuals with greater number of drinks or heavy drinking days in the recent past had greater alcohol-induced deficits in GPe connectivity, particularly to the striatum. Our data also indicated an association between impulsivity and alcohol-induced deficits in GPe\u2014frontal/precentral connectivity. Moreover, alcohol induced changes in GPe-amygdala circuitry suggested greater vulnerabilities to stress-related drinking in some individuals. Taken together, these findings suggest that alcohol may interact with impulsive personality traits and drinking patterns to drive alterations in GPe circuitry associated with behavioral inhibition, possibly indicating a neural mechanism by which binge drinking could lead to impulsive behaviors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1912, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1925, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Harmful drinking behaviors like binge drinking contribute to 5.9% of all global deaths.

Based on preclinical work finding alcohol alters neuronal firing in the GPe, and findings that the pathway is involved in response inhibition, we hypothesized that alcohol infusion would more greatly impact GPe functional connectivity in individuals with heavier drinking and more impulsivity. We also hypothesized that the interaction between recent drinking behaviors and impulsivity would contribute to alcohol-induced changes in GPe functional connectivity. We found reductions in connectivity between the GPe and some subregions of the brain following alcohol infusion in individuals with more drinking in the past 30 days and more heavy drinking days. However, impulsivity was related to greater GPe connectivity while intoxicated. Heavier recent drinking behaviors in combination with higher impulsivity were associated with greater alcohol-induced connectivity change between GPe and amygdala regions, but for most of our connectivity findings, the contribution of drinking and impulsivity were distinct.

In these regions, individuals with patterns of heavy drinking had more coupling at baseline than individuals with lighter drinking patterns; in the binge infusion state, this association between heavy drinking history and GPe connectivity reversed. The alcohol-induced reduction in GPe-frontal pathways in heavier drinkers, as opposed to increased coupling, may specifically reflect impairment of stop signaling. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in particular has been demonstrated to control stop-signaling through the supplementary motor area, upstream from sub-cortical processes, possibly suggesting impaired behavioral inhibition or a shift towards reactive rather than proactive inhibition for individuals with more drinking. This pattern may also reflect an alcohol sensitization effect in heavier drinkers, consistent with sensitization effects seen for other drugs of abuse, particularly in basal ganglia regions. It is also notable that increased connectivity between the frontal gryus and the GPe at rest has also been seen in individuals with hepatic encephalopathy, a result of liver disease such as alcoholic cirrhosis. Our new findings may suggest these previously observed baseline differences reflect a pre-disease vulnerability in heavier drinkers, or indeed that the effects of alcohol even at a non-problem level on the liver contributes to damage to this pathway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32189, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We also found that heavier drinking individuals had less change caused by alcohol infusion in connectivity between the GPe and dorsal ACC, superior frontal gyrus, and insula regions. In fact, while alcohol decreased GPe connectivity with these regions in individuals with more recent drinking, the effect was reverse for those with less drinking. These regions are thought to play a role in signaling unsuccessful stopping, particularly in cases where errors are less common. Intoxication-related changes in connectivity between this region and the GPe in individuals with less recent drinking may reflect novelty of failures in stop-signaling. Individuals who drink more may expect failures of stop-signaling during intoxication, as opposed to those with infrequent drinking. A lack of baseline association between recent drinks and error feedback in the right insula is consistent with lack of differences in expectation of low-frequency errors at baseline. Alternatively, during intoxication, less stop-signaling could correspond to less failures, leading to a reduced need for error signaling. However, there may be other explanations; the insula in particular is a heterogeneous structure involved in a variety of functions. For example, Feng and colleagues suggest reductions in spontaneous activity in this posterior insula structure reflect input of emotional state feedback during fear memory consolidation. From that perspective, one might interpret our results to mean that in individuals with less recent drinking, alcohol decreases the integration of emotional state feedback into behavior.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33793, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "On the other hand, we found that alcohol increased subgenual ACC-GPe connectivity in individuals with more recent drinking.

Greater coupling of ACC-GPe at baseline may lead to a greater tendency to override the stop-signal in face of drinking; this would likely be more pronounced in individuals with positive experiences with alcohol, such as light social drinking, or from the rewarding nature of novelty. However, this override would be less necessary when the impulse control pathways are working sub-optimally and sending less stop-signals, such as during intoxication. Alcohol intoxication may also serve to reduce inhibition via increased connectivity to this override; our results may suggest alcohol has a reward heightening effect in individuals with more recent drinking but a dampening effect in lighter drinkers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34695, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This fronto-striatal circuit has also been described as subserving development of cognitive and motor behavioral plans; an alternative explanation for our findings, then, given baseline decoupling in individuals with more recent drinking, could be a general deficit in action planning.

It may be that individuals with lower GPe-ACC connectivity are more vulnerable to engaging in heavy drinking episodes. Another possibility is that drinking, even at a social level, has lasting effects on resting thresholds of GPe connectivity; for example, some work has shown that alcohol leads to hyperactive IFG response during stop-signaling.

The amygdala modulates striatum activity during reward learning and instrumental choice through direct connections within the limbic stream. Moreover, connectivity between the amygdala and basal ganglia is associated with greater stress-induced cortisol response dependent on the availability of mineralocorticoid receptors. Decoupling of the amygdala and GPe signaling during intoxication in heavier drinkers, particularly those with a tendency to act impulsively during negative emotions, may reflect drinking to reduce stress rather than drinking as a reward. This \u201cdrinking to reduce negative affect\u201d is a key feature in addiction, and may mean that individuals with this pattern of response are particularly vulnerable to developing alcohol use disorder.

Previous work has shown that increased SMA-dorsal striatum structural connectivity was associated with more motor impulsivity, such that these results may suggest that individuals with trait impulsivity have an alcohol-related vulnerability to greater behavioral impulsivity. Alternatively, SMA engagement is associated with reactive inhibition and is thought to influence inhibition through a hyperdirect rather than indirect pathway.

An alternative explanation is that individuals with higher negative urgency tend to engage in internal rumination more; the previous literature illustrates that decreases in activation in the postcentral gyrus at rest are more pronounced in interospective, eyes-closed conditions.

A resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan was collected prior to the infusion and at binge-level exposure. The authors were in particular interested in assessing alcohol-induced changes in globus pallidus externus (GPe) connectivity in relation to drinking behaviors and impulsivity traits.

The greater left-side increases in connectivity (both from ipsi- and contralateral GPe regions) may reflect this pattern as well. We would point out that there were mostly contralateral alcohol-decreases in connectivity from the left GPe, suggesting reductions in connectivity on the right side. We would also point out from the perspective of the role of the GPe pathways, previous work finds that connectivity strength in right-lateralized hyperdirect and indirect basal ganglia/frontal pathways predicted successful response inhibition (Jahfari et al., 2011). On the other hand, increases in left ipsilateral connectivity in individuals with chronic alcohol use has been associated with compensatory function (Chanraud et al., 2011).
