Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during novelty salience processing to investigate this model in people at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis according to their subsequent clinical outcomes. Seventy-six CHR participants as defined using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and 31 healthy controls (HC) were studied while performing a novelty salience fMRI task that engaged an a priori hippocampal-striatal-midbrain circuit of interest. The CHR sample was then followed clinically for a mean of 59.7 months (~5 y), when clinical outcomes were assessed in terms of transition (CHR-T) or non-transition (CHR-NT) to psychosis (CAARMS criteria): during this period, 13 individuals (17%) developed a psychotic disorder (CHR-T) and 63 did not. Functional activation and effective connectivity within a hippocampal-striatal-midbrain circuit were compared between groups. In CHR individuals compared to HC, hippocampal response to novel stimuli was significantly attenuated (P = .041 family-wise error corrected). Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed that stimulus novelty modulated effective connectivity from the hippocampus to the striatum, and from the midbrain to the hippocampus, significantly more in CHR participants than in HC. Conversely, stimulus novelty modulated connectivity from the midbrain to the striatum significantly less in CHR participants than in HC, and less in CHR participants who subsequently developed psychosis than in CHR individuals who did not become psychotic. Our findings are consistent with preclinical evidence implicating hippocampal-striatal-midbrain circuit dysfunction in altered salience processing and the onset of psychosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1957, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1970, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The inappropriate attribution of salience to what would normally be irrelevant or neutral stimuli is a robust feature of psychotic disorders and is linked to altered subcortical dopaminergic signaling. While there are a number of animal models that attempt to describe the pathology and development of psychosis (eg, chronic phencyclidine models, prenatal immune activation models (for review, see ref.), a particularly influential model proposes that psychosis develops when hippocampal dysfunction drives increased subcortical dopamine activity through descending projections to the striatum. Neuroimaging studies of reward salience suggest that salience processing and associated neural hippocampal-striatal-midbrain responses are perturbed in both patients with psychosis and individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis, and that this is associated with positive symptoms. In this context, although novelty has been less investigated as a dimension of salience than reward in psychosis, preclinical evidence indicates that dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain code the salience of unexpected stimuli and respond to novel stimuli. The first aim of the present study was to examine hippocampal-striatum-midbrain circuit activation and effective connectivity in CHR individuals.

PEB for DCM is performed by comparing the posterior density of any (reduced) model in terms of the posterior of its parent or full model. The first step is to estimate a full model (ie, with every connection switched \u201con\u201d) for every subject. Then, a nested model is constructed (ie, with certain conditions switched \u201coff\u201d), which allows the expression of the posterior density of any (reduced) model in terms of the posterior of its parent or full model. This process affords an efficient way to evaluate posterior densities under empirical priors. It is then possible to apply Bayesian model reduction to the posterior densities over the second-level parameters to find out where between-subject effects are expressed.

The result was not attributable to effects of age, treatment with antipsychotic or antidepressant medication, substance use, anxiety/depression symptoms, or differential behavioral engagement with the fMRI task. Complementary whole-brain analysis showed no significant between-group differences (as shown in the supplementary material), suggesting that during \u201cpure stimulus novelty\u201d processing, regions outside our a priori hippocampal-striatal-midbrain mask would not be differentially engaged by CHR individuals. The second major finding came from applying a circuit-based approach to examine functional coupling within a hippocampus\u2013striatal\u2013midbrain circuit during salience processing. CHR subjects showed significantly reduced effective connectivity from the midbrain to the striatum compared to controls, but greater connectivity from the hippocampus to the striatum and from the midbrain to the hippocampus. The reduction in midbrain-striatal connectivity in the whole sample was also evident in the subgroup who later became psychotic compared to the subgroup who did not.

Human imaging evidence has been largely consistent with this model. Resting cerebral blood volume (CBV) or flow (CBF) is elevated in the anterior hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia and CHR individuals. Higher levels of CBV/CBF are positively associated with psychotic symptoms in CHR subjects and with subclinical psychotic-like experiences in schizotypal individuals. Furthermore, CHR subjects show elevated striatal dopamine function, an association between striatal dopamine function and reduced hippocampal activation during a memory task, and altered hippocampal glutamate levels. In turn, altered hippocampal glutamate levels have been related to abnormal hippocampal activation during a memory task in CHR.

Our novelty salience paradigm was adapted from that employed by Bunzeck and Duzel, showing that the VTA/SN preferentially responds to stimulus novelty over other forms of stimulus salience. The contrast between novel and neutral oddballs allowed quantification of neural response to what the authors called \u201cpure stimulus novelty,\u201d as opposed to rareness/deviance per se.

While this analysis also indicated reduced modulation of connectivity from midbrain to striatum in CHR individuals, this effect was no longer significant once sex was adjusted for in the analysis, suggesting a potential relationship between midbrain-striatal connectivity and sex in the CHR state which merits further research. Overall, these findings suggest that, in CHR subjects, afferent and efferent connectivity of the hippocampus were increased, consistent with disrupted interactions within a hippocampal-striatal-midbrain circuit being associated with increased risk for psychosis. This pattern of dysconnectivity would be in line with the maximal tonic activation of dopamine neuron firing hypothesized to occur in psychosis, thought to obscure salience-driven increases in population activity of mesostriatal dopamine neurons, leading to all stimuli being inappropriately registered as salient. This could account for the increased response to non-novel stimuli, and the attenuation of the hippocampal response to salient stimuli, observed in the CHR group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27505, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although the later onset of psychosis in CHR subjects was not associated with significant differences in hippocampal activation, this subgroup showed reduced modulation by pure stimulus novelty of the effective connectivity from midbrain to striatum compared to CHR subjects who did not become psychotic. As a similar alteration in midbrain-striatal connectivity was also evident in the total CHR sample relative to controls (above), this suggests that among the changes in connectivity seen in the CHR sample, alterations in communication from midbrain to striatum may be particularly relevant to the subsequent onset of psychosis. This would be consistent with PET studies in CHR subjects showing elevated midbrain and striatal dopamine function linked to later transition to psychosis. An alternative explanation relates to a \u201cceiling effect\u201d for hippocampal activity and subcortical connectivity in dopamine-related regions; the lower hippocampal response to novel vs non-novel stimuli could reflect a reduced signal-to-noise ratio in the comparison between these 2 conditions in CHR individuals, supported by the (uncorrected) hyper-responsivity to the neutral comparator condition. This notion is consistent with previous findings on emotional salience in CHR groups that lower responses to emotional stimuli are driven by increased responses to the neutral, nonemotional condition, and by reports of increased resting hippocampal perfusion in CHR. Taken together, these results suggest that increased baseline activity/tonic dopamine signaling within this circuitry may render CHR/CHR-T individuals less able to \u201ceffectively\u201d distinguish between novel (salient) and non-novel (non-salient) stimuli.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29211, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite studying a relatively large sample of CHR subjects, the number in the CHR-T subgroup was small; the findings in this subgroup should, therefore, be interpreted with caution, and warrant replication in larger samples. Previous imaging studies of salience processing in CHR individuals relative to HCs have found significant differences in activation of the hippocampal-striatal-midbrain circuit in the context of reward/motivational salience, but not novelty or emotional salience. A possible explanation for this discrepancy might relate to modest sample sizes in previous studies, as we included a relatively large CHR sample (n = 76). Additional sources for discrepancies might relate to the use of different salience task paradigms, tapping on different dimensions of salience processing. More specifically, Roiser et al used the Salience Attribution Task (SAT), a monetary reward task measuring adaptive and aberrant motivational salience. In contrast, Winton-Brown et al used the Salience Integration Task (SIT), a monetary incentive delay task in which conditions were manipulated to examine reward (monetary), novelty (with half of the trials as pre-familiarized and the other half as novel), and aversion (with half of the pictures as emotionally aversive). Given that salience is a multifaceted construct, and that novelty salience had not been studied in relation to transition to psychosis, we used a task paradigm known to robustly isolate the specific processing of novelty. In terms of findings, Roiser et al focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and midbrain, and found that the magnitude of aberrant motivational salience attribution was positively correlated with ventral striatal responses to non-salient cue features. Winton-Brown et al focused on the hippocampus, striatum, and midbrain, and found significant group differences with CHR subjects showing greater activation than HC to reward-predicting stimuli in the ventral pallidum and in the midbrain/hippocampus, while they did not observe any significant effects for novelty or emotional salience. In the present study, using a specific \u201cpure stimulus novelty\u201d salience task, we observed a significant difference in hippocampal responsivity between HC and CHR individuals. Finally, Roiser et al had shown an abnormal association between hippocampal response to motivational salience and dopamine synthesis capacity in a smaller sample of CHR individuals.
