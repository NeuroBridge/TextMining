The ventral striatum may be activated by methamphetamine or cocaine administration in humans and animals. The ventral striatum receives projections of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and has been implicated in reward-based learning and drug-associated conditioned reinforcement learning; thus, it may mediate the rewarding effects of drugs. However, the transition from voluntary drug-taking to compulsive drug-seeking may be the result of dynamic shifts from ventral to dorsal striatal involvement. For example, chronic stimulant use may shift activation from the ventral to dorsal striatum during drug seeking.

Damage to the vmPFC has been associated with blunted emotional reactivity, poorly modulated emotional reactions, disadvantageous social decision-making, impaired goal-directed behaviors, and lack of insight.

Moreover, the relationship between cue-elicited anterior insula activation and treatment outcome has been shown in prior fMRI studies.

Enhanced PFC drug-related cue activation has been reported after short-term abstinence (up to a mean of 8 days) in studies of tobacco smoking. However, it was proposed in the iRISA model that in early abstinence, the sensitivity of the PFC to non-drug\u2013related rewards may be markedly attenuated, leading to impaired inhibitory control in individuals with drug use disorders and promoting relapse. As a result, drug seeking and drug taking may become main motivational drives relative to others during early abstinence. However, studies investigating the impact of abstinence on PFC cue reactivity on exposure to drug, drug-related, or non-drug\u2013related cues are limited. The evidence that methamphetamine may increase sexual desire and heighten sexual rewards may be contrary to the iRISA model.

First, consistent with addiction relapse theories, we hypothesized that when exposed to methamphetamine cues, both STMA and LTMA groups would exhibit increased activation in the ventral striatum, dorsal striatum, vmPFC, and anterior insula compared with HC participants. Second, consistent with evidence of increased sexual motivations associated with methamphetamine use, we hypothesized that both STMA and LTMA groups relative to HC participants would exhibit relatively increased activation in the ventral striatum, dorsal striatum, vmPFC, and anterior insula when exposed to sexual cues. Third, if protracted abstinence may be associated with recovery of functioning in these regions, we hypothesized that there was the possibility that the brain activation in the ventral striatum, dorsal striatum, vmPFC, and anterior insula in the LTMA groups would be approximating more close than the brain activation in HC participants when exposed to both methamphetamine and sexual cues and would exhibit relatively decreased activation compared with the STMA group.

First, this was a cross-sectional study. Preexisting differences in neural functioning in the LTMA and STMA groups may have been present; hence, future longitudinal studies are indicated. Second, STMA participants were not well matched on age and education to the LTMA or HC participants, as STMA participants tended to be younger and have more education. HC participants were not well matched on alcohol use to the STMA or LTMA participants, as HC participants were the least likely to report drinking alcohol among the 3 groups.

Third, STMA and LTMA participants were recruited from voluntary and compulsory drug rehabilitation centers, respectively. As such, differences in motivations for treatment and the abstention from sexual activities may have influenced neural responses to methamphetamine and sexual cues. Hence, future studies should gather information on motivations for treatment and other domains that may differ in voluntary vs compulsory treatment programs. Fourth, due to a limited number of methamphetamine-dependent females completing study procedures (n\u2009=\u20093), the current analyses were limited to males, and it will be important to examine neurofunctioning in women with methamphetamine dependence in future studies given gender-related differences noted in studies of stimulant dependence. Fifth, we did not evaluate participants\u2019 craving or other subjective responses to the sexual and methamphetamine cues, such as their use of methamphetamine for sexual purposes. This may have been relevant to the current study in that SFC activation has been related to cravings for drug and responses to drug-related cues. Sixth, we did not test the lateralized effects in the ROI analyses; further study could consider exploring each region for effects of laterality. Seventh, the whole-brain analysis was performed without covariates to adjust for group differences in age, education, and alcohol use.
