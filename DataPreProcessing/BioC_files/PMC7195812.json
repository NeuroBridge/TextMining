The standard treatment for peripartum women with OUD is buprenorphine. However, the maternal behavior neurocircuit that regulates maternal behavior and mother-infant bonding has not been previously studied for human mothers receiving buprenorphine treatment for OUD (BT). Rodent research shows opioid effects on reciprocal inhibition between maternal care and defence maternal brain subsystems: the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray, respectively. We conducted a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pilot study in humans to specifically examine resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) between the periaqueductal gray and hypothalamus, as well as to explore associations with maternal bonding for BT. We studied 32 mothers who completed fMRI scans at 1 month (T1) and 4 months postpartum (T2), including seven mothers receiving buprenorphine for OUD and 25 non-OUD mothers as a comparison group (CG). The participants underwent a 6-minute resting-state fMRI scan at each time point. We measured potential bonding impairments using the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire to explore how rs-FC with periaqueductal gray is associated with bonding impairments. Compared to CG, BT mothers differed in periaqueductal gray-dependent rs-FC with the hypothalamus, amygdala, insular cortex and other brain regions at T1, with many of these differences disappearing at T2, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of continuing buprenorphine treatment. In contrast, the \u201crejection and pathological anger\u201d subscale of the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire at T1 and T2 was associated with the T1-to-T2 increases in periaqueductal gray-dependent rs-FC with the hypothalamus and amygdala. Preliminary evidence links maternal bonding problems for mothers with OUD early in the postpartum to connectivity between specific care and defence maternal brain circuits, which may be mitigated by buprenorphine treatment.

The standard of care for OUD among pregnant women is opioid maintenance therapy with buprenorphine. Buprenorphine treatment for OUD (BT) is a common choice of treatment to mitigate the physiological stress associated with repeated cycles of maternal/foetal intoxication and withdrawal, preserving uterine stability via receptor occupancy. Compared to detoxification and possibly methadone treatment, BT may result in milder neonatal abstinence syndrome. However, the effects of buprenorphine treatment (BT) on the human maternal brain affected by OUD are not well understood. So far, there is just one study of mothers with polysubstance addictions showing reduced activation in reward regions of the brain in response to their own infant\u2019s face cues; and one of mothers with BT for OUD vs depressed controls showing increased own vs other baby cry responses in multiple motivation brain regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3591, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Maternal substance use in general places their infants at a four-fold increased risk for abuse or neglect, contributing to as much as 80% of child maltreatment cases and 60% of infant out-of-home placements. Opioid-induced deficits in homologous maternal behaviours have also been established in animal models. These effects appear to be mediated in part by activation of mu-opioid receptors in the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (mPOA). More recent findings have implicated the activation of select opioid receptor subtypes within the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in dysregulating maternal behaviour.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4193, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The PAG plays a pivotal role in switching from maternal caregiving behaviours to defensive/aggressive behaviours such as predation in rodents that are known to be regulated by mu and kappa opioid receptor activity. Indeed, infusion of a mu-opioid receptor agonist into the ventrolateral PAG disrupts the balance of maternal care and aggression and kappa-opioid receptor antagonism, shifting behaviours from maternal caring to predation behaviours in rodents. These recent results are particularly relevant for mothers receiving buprenorphine for OUD (BT) because buprenorphine is both a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. The hypothalamus and PAG are key parts of a maternal behaviour neurocircuit (MBN) (Figure 1) that is necessary for the survival of mammals from well-developed rodent models. In this scheme, maternal caregiving and defensive/aggressive systems are balanced with reciprocal inhibition of the hypothalamic mPOA and PAG respectively. Thus, mothers would not be distracted from sensitive maternal care in the absence of threat or exhibit insensitive or aggressive behaviour toward their infant.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5343, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We postulate that human mothers have a homologous MBN (Figure 1), including opposing maternal \u201ccare\u201d and \u201cdefence\u201d subsystems, that reciprocally inhibit each other to balance maternal sensitive infant care behaviours with need for defensive/aggressive behaviours that maintain safety. The care subsystem includes the mPOA in hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum that regulate maternal caregiving behaviours such as licking and grooming for rodents, as well as sensitive, attuned care, gentle gaze, voice, touch and movement for humans. In the defence subsystem, the PAG may activate maternal defensive behaviours, such as aggression toward intruders and predatory behaviours. Among humans, PAG has been activated a baby distress cry, with such activity being related to mental state talk. This is interesting because a mother would need to balance caring and defensive behaviours in response to a cry which may solicit care or signal emergent concerns for safety. The regulation of other regions of the two subsystems of the MBN to orchestrate parenting has been demonstrated with human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, including for the amygdala, insular cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hypothalamus in response to infant cues. These regions may also be affected by addiction and polysubstance use, suggesting the need for more research on task-based brain physiology in the maternal brain.

In another human study performed at 10 weeks postpartum, 14 depressed vs 23 healthy mothers showed decreased DMN activity using a PCC seed region. These results may be interpreted to reflect diminished self-reflection and social cognition, as well as thoughts about duties and responsibilities to others, which are important to parenting.

Slice timing correction was performed using a middle slice as a reference (slice 21). After slice time correction, images within each run were realigned to the mean image of the first run to correct for movement. Realigned functional images and structural images were spatially normalised using the DARTEL method in SPM8. The normalised functional images were re-sliced to 2 \u00d7 2\u00d72 mm voxels. Images were then spatially smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a full-width half-maximum value of 8 mm. To assess and mitigate movement artifact, we calculated the frame-wise displacement (FD), defined as the sum (in millimetres) of the absolute values of frame displacement in successive functional volumes, based on six translation and rotation parameters from the realignment file. Rotational displacements were converted from degrees to millimeters moved on the surface of a 50-mm sphere. A frame-scrubbing routine was used to censor out any frame with FD > 0.5 mm from the regression analysis described below, yielding a scrub ratio for each subject, with a cut-off of 60% censored-out frames for sample exclusion, in accordance with the literature showing that as many as 60% of frames can be removed and still yield analysable results. There was no BT vs CG difference in the averaged FD before scrubbing (BT: mean \u00b1 SD: 0.379 \u00b1 0.063; CG: mean \u00b1 SD: 0.300 \u00b1 0.028; F1,40 = 1.284, MSerror = 0.056, P = .264). This suggests no significant head movement as a potential confounding factor between groups. Three-compartment segmentation of the high-resolution structural image from the DARTEL normalisation were applied to the functional time series to extract cerebral spinal volume and white matter compartments, which then were subjected to a principal component analysis to identify the top five components in each, which should correspond to heart rate and respiratory effects on the BOLD signal. Adjusted time courses were derived from sequential regressions of the time series with the following regressors: linear trend of six motion parameters, their temporal derivatives, the quadratics of these 12 parameters, five components from the principal components analysis of cerebral spinal volume, five components of white matter, followed by band-pass filtering from 0.01 to 0.1 Hz, and then motion scrubbing. The seed mask of PAG, as a region of interest (ROI), in rs-fMRI analysis was generated using PICKATLAS software (WFU PickAtlas; http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/pickatlas) as a box-shaped mask centered at the ventrolateral PAG (MNI: x = 0, y = \u221227, z = \u22128, with 3 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm extensions), in accordance with the literature. In the first-level analysis, adjusted time courses were averaged across all voxels in the seed mask. The average time course in the seed was correlated with time courses from all other voxels in the brain, Fisher r-to-Z transformed, and taken to second level, between-group analyses. In the second-level analysis, statistical parametric maps in the first model were submitted to general linear models (GLMs) to test for the effects of interest. The effects of interest included the group difference (BT vs Controls) in the sample of 32 mothers and each of the three PBQ subscales in a subsample of BT and CG mothers (n = 5 in each group). All of the second-level models were controlled for whole-brain multiple comparisons at the cluster level for voxel-wise intensity threshold at P < .001, which is considered to yield reliable statistical inference.

In terms of Time by Group interaction, BT mothers, compared to CG, showed greater T1-to-T2 increases in the PAG-dependent rs-FC in the right middle temporal gyrus and insular cortex as a result of a reversal of the initial negative rs-FC with PAG in these regions; they also showed greater T1-to-T2 decreases in the PAG-dependent rs-FC in the septal area/caudate nucleus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, left orbital frontal cortex and dorsal precuneus as a result of a reversal of the initial positive rs-FC with PAG in these regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24923, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We also explored whether the PAG-dependent rs-FC in any of the brain regions, showing group differences, was associated with deficits in maternal behaviours, as measured by the PBQ. Although the BT and CG mothers did not differ with respect to the subscales of PBQ, such as for IB, RPA and IFA, we found that the T1-to-T2 changes in PAG-dependent rs-FC with the hypothalamus and right amygdala were positively correlated with some of the subscales of PBQ at T1 and T2. By contrast to group difference analysis, correlation analysis may have detected a difference because of the increased power resulting from data pooling across BT and CG groups. For the PAG-hypothalamus rs-FC, the IB and RPA (but not IFA) at T1 were correlated with the T1-to-T2 increases in the PAG-hypothalamus rs-FC; furthermore, the T1-to-T2 increases in the PAG-hypothalamus rs-FC were correlated with the RPA (but not IB and IFA) at T1. For the PAG-amygdala rs-FC, the RPA and IFA (but not IB) at T1 were correlated with the T1-to-T2 increases in the PAG-amygdala rs-FC; furthermore, the T1-to-T2 increases in the PAG-amygdala rs-FC were correlated with the IB and RPA (but not IFA) at T1. In sum, we found that, among the three subscales of PBQ, RPA was related to the PAG-dependent rs-FC to the greatest extent. Because RPA reflect outward expression of maternal aggression towards the infants, we have found preliminary evidence for the roles of the PAG-hypothalamus and PAG-amygdala rs-FC in the dysregulation of maternal aggression, which may reflect an impairment in the reciprocal inhibition between PAG and the hypothalamus and their roles in maternal aggression and caregiving behaviours, respectively.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26610, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among human mothers, PAG regional responses have been related to observing pictures of a mother\u2019s own child vs an unknown child. These task-based studies have not analysed the reciprocal inhibition between PAG and maternal care regions such as the hypothalamus. It is possible that PAG activation in these studies was part of a balanced response to own infant cues, in which mothers may have been preparing to exhibit caring or defensive behaviours depending on other circumstances. In support, in a recent study of mothers, PAG connectivity with OFC during own vs other baby picture task was inversely related to parenting stress. Perhaps, in that study, stress reduces OFC regulation of defensive and aggressive drives from the PAG, in accordance with circumstances in which a stressed mother must prepare to defend their infant. Future studies may be able to assess the timing of regional brain activity, aiming to describe the order by which brain regions influence each other. In the only rs-FC rodent study of the homologous maternal brain, connectivity between PAG and ACC was decreased for dams with early-life chronic social stress and interpreted as a decrease the reward salience of pups, resulting in depressed maternal care during early lactation. There was also an improvement in connectivity from early to late lactation (similar levels between groups during late lactation), which is considered to be the result of cumulative exposure to pup-related stimuli, such as that observed when nulliparous rats are induced to express maternal care by exposure to foster pups. Below, we discuss the possible maternal brain roles for regions that we report to have PAG-dependent rs-FC differences between BT and CG at T1 and T2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28345, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Connectivity of PAG with other regions of the care and defence subsystems of the MBN to orchestrate parenting in humans is consistent with task-based fMRI responses to infant stimuli in the amygdala, insular cortex, OFC and hypothalamus. In rodent studies, oxytocin neurones in the in mPOA of the hypothalamus regulate dopamine function in the ventral tegmental area and mediate the reward salience of pups. In another rat model, disrupted hypothalamus connectivity with PAG was related to impaired maternal care. Furthermore, rats that display low levels of maternal care exhibit lower oxytocin receptor binding in the mPOA of the hypothalamus, which strengthens the importance of this region with respect to regulating sensitive maternal care. The ACC also plays a key role in mediating appropriate responses to infant stimuli. In response to an infant cry, human mothers with lower depressive symptoms have increased activity in the dorsal ACC. Perhaps depression interferes with ACC-related empathy that has been demonstrated with human neuroimaging meta-analyses and parental brain studies. Furthermore, depressed mothers have been shown to exhibit decreases in the ACC-dependent rs-FC compared to healthy controls.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29566, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The present study is preliminary and has notable limitations. First, given that the CG mothers were not affected by OUD at all and there was no placebo control, we could not control the influence of previous opioid use in confounding the effects of buprenorphine per se. Given the ethical and feasibility barriers to a placebo control trial with OUD subjects, future studies may be able to approach the pure effects of opioids with longitudinal research in which subjects are their own controls at different doses and time points. Future studies will also require a full characterisation of participants with OUD, including the quantity and frequency of all prescriptions, as well as licit and illicit drug, using a \u201ctime-line follow back\u201d interview with calendar prompts and other memory aids to facilitate accurate recall. It will be also important to consider receptor occupancy as an important aspect of opioid dosing. Additional consideration will be required regarding the possible medical consequences of OUD, as well as sociodemographic and medical backgrounds, especially because we already know that parental stress, poverty, anxiety and postpartum depression affect the parental brain. Indeed, stress response dysregulation has been established in other substance use disorders. As noted in the Introduction, changes in rs-FC must be interpreted with caution because they do not capture the directionality of effect, and instead reflect basic associations of brain activity at rest, which are themselves under study . Next, as a result of the small sample size in the samples with PBQ, the results with respect to testing the group difference in PBQ and the associations between the PBQ subscales and PAG-dependent rs-FC warrant replication in future studies. Furthermore, there are complex caveats around the measurement of parental thoughts and behaviours. In the present study, we only used the PBQ, which is a self-report measure that may not capture aspects of parenting about which participants may be embarrassed or unaware. Future work would benefit from more comprehensive interviews such as the working model of the child interview and parental interview of thoughts and behaviours, as well as video-based objective measures of parenting sensitivity, intrusiveness, interfering, forcing, overriding, anger/hostility and criticising of their child. Finally, the translational validity of the MBN across species requires more ethologically valid neuroimaging paradigms connected to real-world behavioural condition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32101, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although preliminary, the present study probes potential buprenorphine effects on mothers affected by OUD. BT is currently the best practice for pregnant women suffering OUD, despite the potential adverse effects of any exogenous opioids on maternal behaviour. It is therefore important to examine whether buprenorphine treatment for OUD, as a partial mu-opioid agonist and kappa-opioid antagonist, exerts beneficial or harmful effects on maternal brain and behaviour during the postpartum. On the one hand, our work may have identified a brain mechanism for the potential benefits of buprenorphine treatment with respect to reversing abnormality of maternal brain function and behaviour: the initial group differences in PAG-dependent resting-state functional connectivity had dissipated by 4 months postpartum, perhaps representing postpartum adjustments in this sample of mothers with healthy infants who were receiving ongoing medical care. On the other hand, our work may have identified a potential link between excessive PAG-hypothalamus functional connectivity and bonding impairments, for which the effects of buprenorphine remain undetermined. In the future, this work may be combined with brain models of other conditions that interfere with parenting, such as parental stress, poverty, anxiety and postpartum depression, as well as potential brain mechanisms at work in parenting interventions, to inform and optimise comprehensive interventions for BT mothers and fathers and identify the potential links between parental brain function and child outcomes. In sum, our preliminary work calls for more attention to PAG-dependent functional connectivity in the MBN as a possible brain mechanism for better assessing opioid-sensitive parental brain functions
