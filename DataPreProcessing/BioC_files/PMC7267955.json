We recruited 42 FES patients (FESs) and 38 healthy controls (HCs), all of whom underwent rsfMRI. We identified 11 white\u2010matter functional networks, which could be further classified into deep, middle, and superficial layers of networks. We then examined network\u2010level interactions among these 11 white\u2010matter functional networks using coefficient Granger causality analysis. We employed group comparisons on the influences among 11 networks using network\u2010based statistic. Excitatory influences from the middle superior corona radiate network to the superficial orbitofrontal and deep networks were disrupted in FESs compared with HCs. Additionally, an extra failure of suppression within superficial networks (including the frontoparietal network, temporofrontal network, and the orbitofrontal network) was observed in FESs. We additionally recruited an independent cohort (13 FESs and 13 HCs) from another center to examine the replicability of our findings across centers. Similar replication results further verified the white\u2010matter functional network interaction model of schizophrenia.

Ji, Liao, Chen, Zhang, & Wang, 2017; Marussich, Lu, Wen, & Liu, 2017). By using these resting\u2010state functional signals, white matter can reproducibly be organized into several functional networks, which are associated with certain gray\u2010matter neurophysiological networks (Peer, Nitzan, Bick, Levin, & Arzy, 2017).

Moreover, regional\u2010level and network\u2010level white\u2010matter functional activity are both aberrant in Parkinson's disease, and are attributed to patient pathology (G. J. Ji et al., 2018). With regard to schizophrenia, network\u2010level white\u2010matter functional abnormalities have also been observed (Jiang et al., 2018).

We examined the interactions among white\u2010matter functional networks using Granger causality analysis (GCA) on the resting\u2010state functional MRI (rsfMRI) signals. Unlike delay correlation method which attempts to reveal temporal dependencies among networks (Jafri, Pearlson, Stevens, & Calhoun, 2008), GCA provides estimation of the direct information of their causality by using the multivariate autoregressive model (Liao et al., 2010). Moreover, coefficient GCA (cGCA), a type of GCA method, can yield information concerning about excitatory or inhibitory causal influences among functional networks by using the regression coefficient (Chen et al., 2009). Therefore, it may be an effective method to detect signed and directional interactions among white\u2010matter functional networks. To further investigate the total influence effect of each white\u2010matter functional network in the interaction model, we additionally examined the causal outflow/inflow of each network by using a traditionally graph\u2010theoretic metric, that is, out/in strength. In line with white\u2010matter functional networks coupling disturbances in schizophrenia documented in a previous study (Jiang et al., 2018), we hypothesized that FESs would exhibit disrupted interactions among white\u2010matter functional networks, and the disruptions would be associated with the patients' clinical symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7971, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "METHODS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7979, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Participants", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7992, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Primary cohort", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8007, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A total of 80 right\u2010handed participants were recruited, including 42 FESs, and 38 sex\u2010, age\u2010, and education level\u2010matched HCs with informed consent (see Table 1 for detailed demographic and clinical information).

T1\u2010weighted anatomical images were segmented into white\u2010matter, gray\u2010matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using SPM8's New Segment algorithm and then normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template. The first 10 volumes were discarded. The remaining volumes were then slice\u2010time corrected and motion corrected (cutoff <3\u2009mm or 3\u00b0) to the mean functional image, and coregistered with an anatomical image. One FES patient and one HC in the replication cohort were excluded for excessive head movement, and no participant was excluded in the primary cohort. The framewise displacement (FD) was calculated and used to determine motion \u201cspikes\u201d (FD\u2009>\u20091\u2009mm) to further minimize motion effects (J. Guo et al., 2019; X. Guo et al., 2019; Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, & Petersen, 2012). The functional images were then detrended to remove linear drifts. Next, nuisance covariates, including 24 head motion parameters (Friston, Williams, Howard, Frackowiak, & Turner, 1996) and the mean CSF signals were regressed out, while the white\u2010matter and global brain signals (Han et al., 2019) were not regressed out to avoid eliminating signals of interest.

For example, in addition to task\u2010related activation in distinct white\u2010matter tracts (Fabri et al., 2011; Fabri & Polonara, 2013; Gawryluk et al., 2011, 2014), the white\u2010matter signals also exhibit a topological organization during the resting state (G.\u2010J. Ji et al., 2017; J. Li et al., 2019), indicating that white\u2010matter signals are more than just noise. Moreover, abnormal white\u2010matter signals have been reported in various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (G. J. Ji et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Makedonov et al., 2016). Therefore, the white\u2010matter signals have a physiological function, and their abnormalities are closely linked to psychopathological status. In view of the network organization pattern of white\u2010matter suggested by a previous study (Peer et al., 2017), this study examined interactions among 11 white\u2010matter functional networks consisting of three layers (superficial, middle, and deep) in FESs and HCs. Despite that converging evidences have proved the neurobiological significance of white\u2010matter signals, the novelty of this field made it necessary to retest current results in another independent sample. However, as we expected, similar retest results confirmed the replicability of white\u2010matter functional network interaction model of schizophrenia. The present study is the first to investigate the white\u2010matter functional network interaction model in FESs to advance our understanding of psychiatric pathological mechanisms in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32276, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The neural substrate of functional interactions within white\u2010matter networks is an issue worthy of discussion. Anatomically, superficial white\u2010matter tracts connect distant cortical neuron cell bodies that are engaged in different functions, while deep white\u2010matter tracts are less surrounded by gray matter. With respect to brain function, there was synchronous neural activity within superficial white\u2010matter networks and cortical gray\u2010matter networks, whereas hardly no correlation pattern was observed between middle or deep white\u2010matter networks and any gray\u2010matter networks (Ding et al., 2018; Peer et al., 2017). In light of the notion that superficial white\u2010matter tracts and corresponding gray\u2010matter cortices share a common functional role (Peer et al., 2017), it is reasonable to infer that superficial white\u2010matter network interactions can be indirectly due to the interplay of cortical gray\u2010matter network. However, relative to surface white matter, deep white\u2010matter tracts exhibited more unique features, for example, different spectral profile (Jiang et al., 2018) and hemodynamic response function (M. Li, Newton, Anderson, Ding, & Gore, 2019) from gray matter, suggesting that interactions within middle/deep white\u2010matter networks subserve specific functions that are less relevant to gray\u2010matter networks. In conclusion, superficial white\u2010matter networks may indirectly interplay with each other through gray\u2010matter networks, while middle and deep white\u2010matter networks are more likely to communicate directly by axon\u2010to\u2010axon interactions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33835, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A generally impaired interactions among white\u2010matter functional networks was found in the present study, rather than a compensation mechanism on white\u2010matter networks functional connectivity as suggested by Jiang et al. (2018), that is, middle\u2010deep white\u2010matter networks had increased connectivity with superficial networks. This inconsistency may be partly due to the type of patients we recruited. The previous study used patients with chronic schizophrenia, while we used FES patients. These two types of schizophrenia show extensive differences in brain structures (Ellison\u2010Wright, Glahn, Laird, Thelen, & Bullmore, 2008) and functions (T. Li et al., 2017). Thus, our findings focus on FES patients' functional changes of white\u2010matter networks. Another possible explanation for the inconsistency in findings relates to the status of antipsychotic medications usage. Patients in the previous study received antipsychotic medications, while our patients were medication\u2010naive. Therefore, our study was able to explore brain changes derived from disease without the influence of antipsychotic medications (Kahn et al., 2008; Radua et al., 2012). A further potential explanation for the conflict may be the GCA method that we used. The functional connectivity analysis that was previously utilized can only measure the statistical dependence between neuronal activities in distinct networks, but it cannot evaluate the influence that one network exerts over another (Liao et al., 2010, 2011). Therefore, by using the GCA method, the present study explored the pathological alterations of schizophrenia from the perspective of white\u2010matter functional networks interactions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35508, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The influences from middle white\u2010matter functional networks to superficial and deep white\u2010matter functional networks were disrupted in FESs. The middle white\u2010matter networks were anchored on the corona radiata, which contain reciprocal connecting fibers that link cortex and subcortical bodies (e.g., the basal ganglia; Catani & Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008). Anatomically, the corona radiata first grows and then atrophies with age during normal development (Asato, Terwilliger, Woo, & Luna, 2010; Burzynska et al., 2010), while it abnormally atrophies in schizophrenia (Cui et al., 2011; Walther et al., 2011). By using a novel method, the present study enabled the detection of potential dynamic information transfer through the corona radiate fibers. Our results revealed damaged information export from the middle corona radiate networks in schizophrenia, which additionally support the structural disruption. Specifically, this information export disruption was decomposed into its descending excitatory regulation to deep white\u2010matter networks and its ascending excitatory regulation to superficial orbitofrontal white\u2010matter network. According to our inference, the middle corona radiate network should downstream regulate the deep white\u2010matter network through deep axon\u2010to\u2010axon white\u2010matter tracts, hinting that the path plausibly subserves a communication function (Peer et al., 2017). Combining with the impaired upstream regulation to the superficial orbitofrontal white\u2010matter network, the damaged information export of the middle networks might explain the cognitive and/or perceptual\u2010motor deficits in schizophrenia (Carlson, 2014).

Specifically, the regulation from frontoparietal white\u2010matter network was damaged in FESs, which are coincident with previous gray\u2010matter findings of a dominant disruption of frontoparietal control network in schizophrenia (Baker et al., 2014). Therefore, dysfunction of frontoparietal network, whether at cortical gray\u2010matter level or underlying white\u2010matter level, plays a critical role in the pathology of schizophrenia. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the major surface white\u2010matter disturbance, which involved in reduced suppression from frontoparietal white\u2010matter network to temporofrontal and orbitofrontal white\u2010matter networks, is in line with the dysconnection model of schizophrenia (Friston & Frith, 1995; Stephan et al., 2009). As Friston and Frith suggested, disrupted suppression from frontoparietal gray\u2010matter network to temporal gray\u2010matter network might result in a failure to integrate intrinsically generated behavior and extrinsically generated percepts, which could be a sufficient explanation for various symptoms in schizophrenia. More importantly, the correspondence between superficial white\u2010matter and gray\u2010matter findings in schizophrenia potentially confirmed our inference that superficial white\u2010matter network interactions were driven by the interplay of cortical gray\u2010matter networks.
