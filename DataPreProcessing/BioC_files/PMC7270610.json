At the beginning of each trial, participants viewed one of three symbols (a cue) that indicated the potential to gain fifty pence (square containing an ascending arrow), lose fifty pence (square containing a descending arrow) or experience no financial outcome (square containing a horizontal line - here referred to as a neutral trial). Each cue was presented for one second, with a variable duration (2\u20134\u00a0s) for the subsequent anticipation period. Following the anticipation period, participants made a button press response upon the presentation of a visual target (star located within a circle). Following their response to the visual target, participants received feedback (1.5\u00a0s) as to whether they were successful (\u201cHit\u201d) or unsuccessful (\u201cMiss\u201d) on that trial and saw a running total of their winnings up to that point in the task. Following feedback, there was an end fixation period (3\u20135\u00a0s) before the commencement of the next trial. Because the primary objective of ICCAM was to examine the neural correlates of reward anticipation, we chose to use a smaller number of loss trials in order to amplify the incentive salience of the gain trials during the task. Consequently, there was a total of 18 gain, 6 lose and 18 neutral trials on each run of the task. The MID task was tailored to adapt to the visual target reaction time of each participant by using a staircase algorithm, such that the presentation of the visual target became shorter as performance improved during the experiment. This enabled us to set a limit on the success rate of each participant (\u223c66%), which additionally served to incentivize participants to engage in the task. Participants were instructed to maximize their winnings and were told they would receive them at the end of the study.

The heterogenous nature of the ADD sample with respect to mono- and multiple- drug dependencies and the variable abstinence length from these substances, may have been a constraining factor, reflecting varying levels of restoration of function in the striatum (and other regions). For example, studies have shown there are deficits in markers of striatal dopamine functioning during early abstinence, with the variable abstinence length in the current sample masking possible disturbances in this region. Another possibility is that a voxel-wise approach was insufficiently sensitive to detect group differences across smaller regions such as the striatum. The results from the network analyses (discussed below) did reveal striatal regions (e.g., accumbens, caudate) that were part of a sub-network of nodes demonstrating less connectivity in the ADD group. This may further endorse the sensitivity of exploring measures of functional network connectivity over voxel-wise approaches for detecting more extensive disruptions in neural processing.
