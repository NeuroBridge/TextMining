The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is involved in the modulation of decision-making and executive control to behave appropriately by integrating sensory and emotional information. The frontal cortex lesion is related to behavioral impairments, such as inflexibility, social inappropriateness, isolation, and apathy. The right MFG has been well studied and may play a major role in integrating visual, auditory, and somatic information to obtain an extensive and generalized interpretation of the environment. Nevertheless, many research results are not entirely consistent and are even contradictory. For instance, some researchers have reported increased ReHo value in the frontal lobe, but others have failed to receive the same results and have even found decreased ReHo value in the frontal lobe. Several factors, such as head motion regression model, cultural backgrounds, illness courses, illness heterogeneity, experimental parameters, and statistical methods, may be accountable. The cuneus belongs to visual cortex which is involved in visual processing and associated with attention and working memory. The abnormal regional spontaneous activities in the cuneus in the early stages of schizophrenia may cause higher-level cognitive impairments. It was discovered that ReHo values decreased in right cuneus of patients with schizophrenia, which was partially consistent with previous findings.

Neuroimaging studies have indicated that right MFG aberrations possibly play a crucial role in the emergence of psychotic symptoms of auditory hallucinations, thought disorder, and positive psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. Frontal lobe dysfunction possibly correlates with the occurrence of negative symptoms, especially in right MFG, which is particularly vulnerable to long-term effects of schizophrenia. A partial brain area of right MFG overlapped the medial PFC, and a study on adolescent-onset schizophrenia has also shown that ReHo values in right medial PFC increased. Another study has found that concomitant structural and causal connectivity deficits in medial PFC correlate with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Similarly, our results suggested that negative symptoms positively correlated with ReHo values in right MFG in patients with dn-FES at the early stage. In summary, we found that ReHo values in right MFG were associated with not only positive symptoms but negative symptoms in dn-FES.

This brain area has input and output connectivity with the supramodal cortex and functions as a mediator of information processing and information transfer during multiple cognitive operations. The right MFG region is involved in higher cognitive functions, such as multitasking, planning of future actions, strategic processes in memory recall, various executive functions, and social cognition. Moreover, ReHo values of right MFG negatively correlated with social cognition in our study. Social cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are broad, thereby imposing a huge burden on functional recovery. Severe social cognitive deficits exist in patients with schizophrenia, and social cognitive deficits are associated with abnormal spontaneous activities of the medial PFC. The PFC is an important regulator in social cognition, and the disruption in prefrontal microcircuitry is thought to play an essential role in pathophysiology of schizophrenia with social deficits.
