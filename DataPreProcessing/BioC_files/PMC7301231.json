The current study tested whether the right DLPFC-left HF functional coupling showed plasticity during cognitive training (Study I) and whether rs1344706 affected the plasticity (Study II). In Study I, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with 30 subjects receiving 20 sessions of adaptive training on a memory span task (the training group) and 30 subjects practicing on a non-adaptive easy version of the same memory span task for 20 sessions (the control group). All subjects were scanned using fMRI before and after the training. Analyses of resting-state and task-state fMRI data consistently showed that the adaptive memory span training significantly strengthened the right DLPFC-left HF functional coupling. In Study II, we conducted a genetic association study with 101 subjects (combining the data from the training group in Study I with those from an additional subsequent sample of 71 subjects who received the same training and fMRI scans). Results showed that rs1344706 was significantly associated with training-induced changes in functional coupling. Subjects carrying the non-risk allele (C) of rs1344706 showed greater training-induced plasticity than the risk allele (A) homozygotes.

In contrast, the HF is suppressed when performing a working memory task but is activated during the resting state.

First, the functions of the anterior and posterior HF were similar regarding their contributions to working memory based on a most recent meta-analysis on brain activation and functional connectivity. An earlier structural MRI study also found that the anterior and posterior HF were similarly correlated with working memory. Within this current study, the left HF was deactivated along the anterior and posterior axis which covered the varied HF coordinates that were found in our resting-state functional connectivity analyses and task-state PPI analyses. In other words, despite their differences in specific coordinates, all of the significant HF locations were involved in working memory. The second plausible explanation is methodological.
