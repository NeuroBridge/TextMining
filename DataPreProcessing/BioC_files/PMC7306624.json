In this paper, we investigate if there is biological evidence to support the symptom-based clinical categories by looking across the three disorders using dynamic connectivity measures, and provide meaningful characteristics on which brain functional connectivity measures are commonly or uniquely impaired. Large-sample functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) datasets from 623 subjects including 238 healthy controls (HCs), 113 SZ patients, 132 SAD patients, and 140 BPP patients were analyzed. First, we computed whole-brain dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) using a sliding-window technique, and then extracted the individual connectivity states by applying our previously proposed decomposition-based DFC analysis method. Next, with the features from the dominant connectivity state, we assessed the clinical categories by performing both four-group (SZ, SAD, BPP and healthy control groups) and pair-wise classification using a support vector machine within cross-validation. Furthermore, we comprehensively summarized the shared and unique connectivity alterations among the disorders. In terms of the classification performance, our method achieved 69% in the four-group classification and >80% in the between-group classifications for the mean overall accuracy; and yielded 66% in the four-group classification and >80% in the between-group classifications for the mean balanced accuracy. Through summarizing the features that were automatically selected in the classifications, we found that among the three symptom-related disorders, their disorder-common impairments primarily included the decreased connectivity strength between thalamus and cerebellum and the increased strength between postcentral gyrus and thalamus.

Given the ambiguities between the two disorders, Kasanin introduced the concept of SAD, defined by a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorder, acknowledging their symptomatic overlap. The diagnosis of SAD is made when there are symptoms of major depression or mania, along with psychotic symptoms. SAD is likely to experience severe mood symptoms accounting for more than half of the total duration, while SZ may present brief mood symptoms. Once the psychotic symptoms predominate the illness period of SAD, the diagnosis leans towards SZ. As such, there is a great deal of confusion in differentiating SAD from BPP or SZ.

Combining the results with the observation from Fig. S4 that shows the mean strengths of those important connectivity features, the three disorders showed commonality in the decreased connectivity strength between thalamus and cerebellum as well as the increased strength between postcentral gyrus and thalamus, although strictly there were no common important features used for all HC vs. disorder classifications. Furthermore, our results also suggest that BPP and SZ showed similarity in the connectivity changes between cuneus and insula, between cuneus and putamen, and between cuneus and supramarginal gyrus.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37286, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to the shared alterations among these disorders, we also summarized the disorder-unique features in Table S4 and demonstrate them in Fig. S5.

It is observed that in general these disorders showed various changes relative to HC. To look further into their specificity, we compared Table S4 with Table 1, and found five connectivity features were used for both the four-group and HC vs. BPP classification, thus presenting more specificity in BPP. In a similar way, there were four and three connectivity features for SAD and SZ, separately. As shown in Table 3, BPP-specific alterations involved connectivities between left supramarginal gyrus and right caudate, between left middle temporal gyrus and right middle temporal pole, between right pallidum and right cerebellum crus, between left superior frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, between left supramarginal gyrus and vermis. For SAD, significant unique connections were between right middle frontal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus, between left rolandic and left Heschl\u2019s gyrus, between left cuneus and right middle temporal pole, and between left rectus and left cerebellum.

Although our classification accuracy is greater than the chance (25%), the classification using biological measures did not perfectly separate these clinical diagnostic groups. There are several issues that could cause the inaccuracy in separating these groups: the complexity of the multi-group classification problem, the difficulty of high-dimensional biological measures in representing the clinical symptoms, and the inherent unreliability of the clinically determined diagnosis itself. Some groups have therefore developed biologically-based subtypes across psychotic illnesses using features depending purely on empirical knowledge, and not on clinical symptoms. Such individual \u201cBiotypes\u201d showed more neurobiological homogeneity than diagnosis-based categories. This biological reclassification of psychosis is an important step forward, but does not yet invalidate traditional clinically-derived categories.

To date, a few studies have used dynamic functional connectivity measures to classify mental illnesses. Rashid et al. applied a clustering method to group dynamic connectivity patterns into different connectivity states. They then utilized the regression coefficients as features obtained by projecting the dynamic patterns onto the states to classify among HC, SZ and BPP (159 subjects in total), resulting in an average classification accuracy of 84.28%, but their study mixed SAD patients into the SZ group probably due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two highly-related disorders. Rabany et al. performed classification across HC, SZ and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on state-related measures (such as fraction rate of dwell time) derived from dynamic connectivity patterns, providing 81.8% accuracy for SZ, 50% for ASD, and 41.2% for HC. A recent work utilized the dynamics of interaction between default mode network, salience network and executive network to classify schizophrenia patients from healthy controls, resulting in 78% accuracy.

Our finding provides clear evidence that thalamic connectivity changes consistently exist in these psychiatric disorders, which accords with previous studies. One paper studying SZ using resting fMRI connectivity suggests that thalamic connectivity with sensorimotor areas is related to the severity of cognitive deficits and clinical symptom, and the thalamic functional connectivity in the cerebellum is positively correlated with processing speed. Another study confirms the changes of SZ in connectivity between thalamic and post-central regions, and between thalamic and cerebellar regions in combination with their relationship to clinical features.

More importantly, our results highlight these disorder-common and disorder-specific abnormalities in brain connectivity. This provides clues for understanding the current symptom-based categories and hopefully providing prior information for future development of biologically meaningful categories. It is worth noting that since different hypotheses were proposed in analyzing functional dynamics, there have been various approaches such as clustering and decomposition that can be used for extracting connectivity states. In our work, we extended our previously proposed decomposition method by performing ICA on all subjects\u2019 data so as to yield direct and unbiased connectivity-related features for classification. Previous studies have shown better performance using dynamic connectivity, compared to static connectivity. To test this point using our data, we employed the AAL-based static connectivity measures to classify the four groups, under the same 10-fold cross-validation pipeline and SVM classifier. As shown in Fig. S6, the mean classification accuracy was 60.01%, the mean balanced accuracy was 56.92%, and the mean balanced precision was 59.04%.

We also summarized the important features used in the four-group classification in Table S6. These significant connections primarily consisted of frontal, temporal and cerebellar regions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48668, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several aspects of our work may need future refinement. First, functional connectivity based on fixed AAL regions can be limiting. While there is no gold standard for the selection of ROIs, functional connectivity obtained using different parcellation strategies can result in various classification performances. In this paper, we employed AAL regions to estimate dynamic connectivity so as to have a convenient comparison with our previous study that analyzed the same datasets. Although the classical AAL atlas has been widely applied for the classification between patients with brain disorders and healthy controls, atlas-based template might not perfectly adapt to signals in the individual fMRI data. In the future, we or others can adopt data-driven methods, such as ICA-driven regions, parcellations through clustering approaches, and functional connectivity boundary mapping, which could further improve classification performance by allowing the regions to adapt to the individuals rather than using fixed ROIs. Second, in this paper the group-level connectivity states were obtained by performing a group ICA on the dynamic connectivity patterns of all subjects so as to decrease the computation load, which is consistent to previous studies. For a more unbiased manner, the group-level states should be estimated using only the training data and then used to guide the computation of the individual states for both the training and testing data. To access the possible influence, we performed group ICA on the randomly selected training data for ten times. Our results show that the connectivity states from different training datasets were highly similar to the states computed using all subjects, with the correlations (reflecting the similarity) between the dominant states all higher than 0.98 (See Fig. S7). Third, although our results show some biological support for these existing categories of mental illness, given that symptoms are known to be an imperfect way to identify medical disorders of any type from, further work should focus on refining categories by taking advantage of neuroimaging measures. The question of whether traditional categories of mental illness should be ultimately replaced by those based purely on biology is a related issue. Fourth, in our method, for facilitating the classification and enabling the feature correspondence, we used a fixed number of components (i.e. the number of states) while performing decomposition on all data. Previous work identified more inconsistent connectivity states between disease and healthy groups. Using our decomposition method, the dominant state would be similar between different groups (as shown in Fig. S8). How to estimate unique but comparable states from dynamics with the lack of group labels deserves further study. In this paper, we set the state number to five, consistent to many previous studies. How to determine an optimal component number is difficult in the blind signal processing problem. But, our additional experiments support that the estimated connectivity states under different number of states (M\u00a0=\u00a03, 4, 5, 6 and 7) tended to be stable under different settings (Fig. S9). Fifth, due to the limited sample size, the four groups included different subject numbers, which could affect the results to some extent. To verify this, we randomly selected 100 subjects from each group, and reran all analyses. In general, the results were consistent with our original results. Regarding the four-group classification, the mean overall classification accuracy was 71.25% in distinguishing among HC, BPP, SAD and SZ groups. For individual class accuracy, the mean value was 72.9% for HC, 73.62% for BPP, 72.78% for SAD and 65.7% for SZ; for individual class precision, the mean value was 74.66%, 69.11%, 74.06% and 71.96%, respectively. We summarized the 28 important features in Table S7, six of which consistently presented in the original results. These features also involved the frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions. However, further evaluations are still needed when more data are available.
