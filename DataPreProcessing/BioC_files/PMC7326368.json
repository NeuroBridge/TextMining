Altered functional connectivity within the executive control network (ECN) might underlie the progressive inability to control consumption of alcohol and other drugs as substance use disorders progress. Genetic and epigenetic factors have been associated with substance use disorders (SUDs). For example, dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) functioning has been associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and related phenotypes, including correlates of executive functioning. The present study aims to explore the relationship between a continuous measure of alcohol-related problems, epigenetic markers (methylation) within the DRD2 gene, and functional connectivity within the ECN among a sample of polysubstance users. A community sample of 658 subjects, whose consumption of alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis span across a spectrum of quantity and frequency of use, were obtained across previous studies in polysubstance using populations. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed to identify intrinsic connectivity networks using a priori regions of interest. Methylation measurement of functionally relevant sites within the DRD2 gene was achieved via pyrosequencing. Regression-based models, including mediation and moderation models, tested the association between DRD2 methylation, functional connectivity within intrinsic neural networks (including the ECN), and severity of alcohol problems. Results suggest that average DRD2 methylation was negatively associated with right ECN (RECN) and left ECN (LECN) connectivity, but not associated with other networks tested, and DRD2 methylation was significantly associated with alcohol problems severity. Mediation models were not supported, although moderation models suggested that connectivity between edges within the RECN moderated the relationship between DRD2 methylation and AUD severity.

Executive functioning is a psychological construct that has been defined by experts as \u201cthe ability to maintain an appropriate problem solving set for attainment of a future goal.\u201d As outlined in Talpos and Shoaib, executive functioning is operationalized by a variety of task-based measures that fall into three broad categories, namely, rule generation and selection (eg, attentional set shifting), adapting behavioral responses to incoming stimuli (eg, stop signal, go/no-go), and overcoming a habit (eg, reversal learning). Results suggest that drug-addicted rats with ventral striatal D2 dysfunction fail to learn to inhibit responding to drug-related cues even when they are followed by punishment. In the human literature, D2 dysfunction has also been associated with decrements in response inhibition to drug cues, and degree of dopamine signaling has been associated with sensitivity of prefrontal activation during risk taking.

Such connectivity analyses have allowed researchers to investigate neural networks underlying executive control processes within the context of substance use disorders. Research in this area has shown that chronic heavy alcohol use is associated with altered strength of connectivity, or temporal correlation of activity, between brain regions, namely, the frontal and limbic areas. For example, recently abstinent alcoholic patients compared with healthy controls showed reduced connectivity in the fronto-cerebellar network taken from a motor task, and reduced fronto-striatal connectivity during a response inhibition task paradigm. Reduced connectivity among regions associated with executive control (eg, reduced prefrontal cortical connectivity) has been associated with bias towards reward-seeking behavior in drug users. It follows that chronic heavy drinking has been shown to confer risk for disrupted cognitive processes, namely, executive functioning. Throughout the paper, we refer to the executive control network (ECN). This network includes dorsolateral frontal and parietal regions.

Additionally, individuals with problematic alcohol use showed reduced connectivity strength across several networks, including the left executive control network (LECN), in particular between the DLPFC and parietal temporal regions.

The dopamine receptor 2 gene (DRD2) has been shown to regulate D2 receptor functioning (eg, Hirvonen et al; thus, mechanisms that alter DRD2 gene expression could possibly underlie D2 functioning and executive functioning. Epigenetic modifications are one set of processes that might underlie D2 receptor functioning and neural decrements associated with chronic alcohol use. Epigenetics refers to chemical processes that modulate the surrounding structures of DNA as opposed to changing the sequence itself. Methylation, one type of epigenetic modification, involves the addition of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of cytosine residues. Epigenetic modifications, including methylation, have been associated with alterations in gene expression. Although DRD2 methylation has yet to be investigated extensively in the context of AUD phenotypes, Hillemacher and colleagues demonstrated that lower D2 methylation was associated with abstinence among individuals with a history of pathologic gambling (Hillemacher et al, 2015), which shares common neural mechanisms with substance use disorders. Furthermore, among a sample of alcohol and nicotine dependent patients, methylation of the DRD2 gene was associated with alcohol and nicotine codependence, along with methylation of additional addiction-related genes.

See Table 1 for descriptive statistics on substance use by source study. Two of the three studies were clinical trials involving pharmacotherapies (olanzapine and varenicline); however, the imaging data included in the present set of analyses were collected during baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Therefore, the imaging data were collected prior to the initiation of the medication regimens. Briefly, participants were recruited from the Albuquerque or the Boulder/Denver metropolitan regions through advertisements in local print, online media, and radio advertisements. Exclusionary criteria across studies included previous brain injury or loss of consciousness for more than 5 minutes, history of bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder, or a positive pregnancy test. Additionally, across the three studies, subjects were excluded if they tested positive for illicit drugs of abuse (other than marijuana). Subjects abstained from smoking for 2 hours before scanning, from alcohol consumption for 24 hours (per patient report), and were required to pass a breathalyzer test immediately prior to participation. The resting state neuroimaging and methylation analysis procedures were identical across all studies that were included in these analyses. Written informed consent, approved by the University of New Mexico Human Research Committee, was obtained from all participants.

We hypothesized that DRD2 methylation would be associated with reduced connectivity within the ECN and measures of drinking problems severity. Results suggest that methylation of the DRD2 gene is indeed associated with reduced connectivity within the right and left, ECN. Additionally, DRD2 methylation demonstrates clinical relevance, as average DRD2 methylation across sites within a regulatory region of the gene is associated with measures of drinking problems severity in our sample of polysubstance users. This suggests that greater DRD2 methylation, on average across the sites of interest, is associated with greater severity of problem drinking, which is consistent with the Bidwell and colleagues\u2019 findings. We also hypothesized that ECN connectivity would mediate the relationship between DRD2 methylation and AUDIT, thereby serving as a mechanism linking epigenetic changes to behavioral measures, but this model was not supported. Connectivity of certain edges connecting the frontal and parietal regions within the RECN did, however, moderate the relationship between DRD2 methylation and AUDIT, suggesting the possibility that ECN connectivity and DRD2 methylation have a synergistic effect on disorder severity. Importantly, due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, it is not clear whether the ECN connectivity and DRD2 methylation contribute to the development of AUD, if connectivity decrements within the ECN and DRD2 hypermethylation are consequences of the disorder, or both.

For example, a review by Volkow and Morales discusses a series of studies suggesting that reduced D2 signaling in the striatum is associated with reduced neural activity in regions within the control network (eg, PFC). These findings provide evidence that D2 signaling might be associated with neural correlates of ECN functioning. The present analyses add to this literature by suggesting an association between D2 methylation and another neural correlate of ECN functioning (ie, connectivity). Additionally, one particular study found that lower extrastriatal D2 binding is associated with variability in executive functioning. Similarly, literature suggests that downregulation of D2 availability has been associated with and poor reversal learning. Additionally, researchers have proposed that changes in D2 functioning is a mechanism by which frontocorticostriatal circuitry becomes dysregulated, which in turn contributes to poor reversal learning within states of addiction. Furthermore, D2 functioning has been associated with functional measures of executive functioning. The \u201cGo-No-Go\u201d paradigm, a frequently used in-scanner task that taps executive functioning, has demonstrated differences between AUD populations and controls.

Of particular import, three of these regions, the DLPFC, OFC, and inferior parietal gyrus, also demonstrate network edge sensitivity to D2 receptor function. For instance, impaired attentional control and response inhibition has been associated with reduced connectivity between prefrontal regions and inferior parietal regions. Such fronto-parietal connectivity, particularly in the right hemisphere, plays a major role in maintaining attention towards current goals, and responding flexibly to new and relevant environmental information. Indeed, the orbitofrontal cortex and its relationship with DLPFC and inferior parietal regions has been shown to matter in several cognitive functions associated with AUD.

Fronto-parietal connectivity appears to be central to highly adaptive control processes, where proper functioning might prevent onset or worsening of AUD symptoms. D2 receptor function has been implicated in disruption of nodes within these ECN edges, which are in turn linked to behavioral outcomes involved in AUD. Prefrontal regions appear to be particularly affected and have downstream impact on the functional integrity of edges that they are a part of, such as the DLPFC-inferior parietal edge. Methylation-induced change in D2 receptor expression may also influence ECN through altered ratio with D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex, with functional implications for components of executive function such as working memory and behavioral flexibility, and information processing during times of executive demand. Optimal balance between D1 and D2 receptors in prefrontal cortical regions is credited with maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio of incoming information.

However, quantifying methylation using peripheral tissue types, such as saliva samples, is feasible on a large scale. Therefore, our methods allow for a larger sample size than would be feasible with a PET study design, and with this increased power, we are able to flesh out the mediating vs moderating role of executive network connectivity in the relationship among DRD2 methlyation and AUD severity.
