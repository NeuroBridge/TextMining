As these gesture deficits can be found early in the course of illness and as they can predict later outcomes, exploring their neural basis may lead to a better understanding of schizophrenia. While gesturing has been reported to rely on a left lateralized network of brain regions, termed praxis network, in healthy subjects and lesioned patients, studies in patients with schizophrenia are sparse. It is currently unclear whether within-network connectivity at rest is linked to gesture deficit. Here, we compared the functional connectivity between regions of the praxis network at rest between 46 patients and 44 healthy controls. All participants completed a validated test of hand gesture performance before resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was acquired. Patients performed gestures poorer than controls in all categories and domains. In patients, we also found significantly higher resting-state functional connectivity between left precentral gyrus and bilateral superior and inferior parietal lobule. Likewise, patients had higher connectivity from right precentral gyrus to left inferior and bilateral superior parietal lobule (SPL). In contrast, they exhibited lower connectivity between bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG). Connectivity between right precentral gyrus and left SPL, as well as connectivity between bilateral STG, correlated with gesture performance in healthy controls. We failed to detect similar correlations in patients. We suggest that altered resting-state functional connectivity within the praxis network perturbs correct gesture planning in patients, reflecting the gesture deficit often seen in schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1952, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1965, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Gestures are an integral part of communication.

These impairments are part of a generalized nonverbal communication deficit in schizophrenia. Gesture deficits may occur in first episode or chronic patients.

In contrast, another study found no differences in brain activation between controls and patients with schizophrenia, neither during observation, imitation, nor during execution (ie, pantomime) of finger movements.

The question remains, whether the resting-state connectivity alterations also affect task activation or real-world functioning. In healthy controls, this association seems to be the case. In an fMRI study on motor imagination and motor execution, resting-state functional connectivity in a network including precentral gyrus, IPL, and SPL correlated with activation in contralateral (left) precentral gyrus and parietal cortex during the consecutive task. Likewise, in our study, we found that lower resting-state connectivity between precentral gyrus and SPL or IPL was associated with better gesture performance. Given that patients had increased functional connectivity at rest, and that they performed inferior to controls in the TULIA, we may speculate that abnormal balance within the IPL/SPL components of the praxis network at rest could drive the inferior gesture performance. Interestingly, during the fMRI task, gesture performance in patients was better when the left IPL had increased neural activity during gesture planning. Abnormally increased resting-state functional connectivity to IPL may perturb correct gesture planning via faulty information flow. Transfer of spatiotemporal representations of a movement from IPL to premotor cortex may be impaired by increased functional connectivity at rest, leading to inaccurate motor program generation in premotor cortex and SMA. Aberrant resting-state functional connectivity to IPL and SPL could also render the praxis network less efficient for flexible recruitment and allocation of neural resources to the task. The increased connectivity between premotor cortex and IPL/SPL may be a compensation for other pathological processes, such as aberrant connectivity in the motor system.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25482, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The STG has previously been associated with language and gesture processing, which is particularly relevant linking semantic meaning to sensory input.

Patients also showed hypoactivation in bilateral IFG during planning of gestures. In contrast, resting-state connectivity between IFG and other parts of the praxis network did not differ between groups. Moreover, there was no relevant association of IFG connectivity and gesture performance in the exploratory analyses. This could have 2 explanations: Either the IFG connectivity within the praxis network is adjusted according to task demands in both groups or IFG resting-state connectivity is preserved in schizophrenia. The absence of any correlation between IFG connectivity and gesture behavior in patients and the previous task fMRI results, however, argue against preserved IFG function in schizophrenia.

Indeed, correlation analyses in the total sample revealed that performance correlated negatively with connectivity between bilateral precentral gyrus and left IPL or SPL, and positively with connectivity between STGs. Analyses in controls yielded less but similar associations while we failed to detect any associations in patients. The higher number of significant correlations in the total sample compared with the control group is likely caused by the higher statistical power due to the larger N (90 in total sample vs 44 in control group).

Thereby, we found a strong positive correlation of TULIA and connectivity only between right SPL and right STG in patients. This association may point to a deficit in some patients when linking motor and spatial information with gesture semantics. Again, disruption or dysbalance of resting-state functional connectivity is linked to inferior gesture performance in schizophrenia. However, the group differences during the task fMRI study in a subset of our participants were much larger than the differences in resting-state connectivity. We therefore suggest that while recruitment of the praxis network is clearly impaired in patients with schizophrenia during gesture planning, differences in resting-state connectivity of the same network are less pronounced. Some of the relevant group differences will only appear when the network has to adjust according to task demands. Thus, future studies on gesture in schizophrenia should take both task and resting-state fMRI into account.
