The case-control differences in frontal or parietal lobar gene transcription reported by Gandal et\u00a0al. and Fromer et\u00a0al., although based on a relatively large number of patients, are not as precisely localized or representative of the whole brain as the AHBA and MRI data. This study has a considerably larger sample size than any previously reported MRI study of schizotypy, and it is the first to evaluate a microstructural MRI marker, which was more strongly related to schizotypy than the more conventional macrostructural MRI marker of cortical thickness. Nonetheless, it is theoretically surprising that there was limited evidence for significant SRM of the frontal and lateral temporal cortex (although magnetization of the medial prefrontal cortex was significantly associated with the disorganized component of schizotypy) (Figure\u00a01E), possibly reflecting limited statistical power. The SPQ is a self-report questionnaire measure of schizotypy; more refined and objective assessments of schizotypal traits would likely add value to future studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations":
