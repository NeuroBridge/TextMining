Follow-up analyses indicated that parental education differences did not account for differences in functional connectivity. Nevertheless, there may be other environmental variables not assessed here (eg, family income, housing status) that may account for differences in functional connectivity. In addition, future studies should examine the degree to which connectivity differences in FHPs are specific to having a parent with AUD or generalize to other forms of substance use disorders in the parents.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26652, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This sensorimotor network connectivity finding is consistent with other studies that have found deficits in regions involved in motor behavior in FHPs. Interestingly, functional connectivity appears to be reduced in participants with AUD in BA6 and other regions implicated in motor behaviors; however, in AUD, the reductions in connectivity appear to be more pronounced and additionally include fronto-parietal networks implicated in executive control. Although more research is clearly warranted, these results suggest that lower excecutive control related connectivity may manifest after years of problematic alcohol use but may not necessarily be present in high-risk, FHP youth. The family history effect appears to be substantially weaker and largely independent of the robust age differences in internetwork connectivity found in this sample. We found differences in internetwork connectivity between the groups 13 to 14 years and 17 to 18 years of age, indicating that although the basic pattern of resting state networks is well established by adolescence, the strength of correlation between networks continues to change over a few short years. The general pattern of results points to greater connectivity between networks in the older age group. However, the cerebellum appears to have very different internetwork connectivity in the two age groups. In the group 13 to 14 years versus 17 to 18 year of age, connectivity was higher between the cerebellum network and sensory/sensorimotor areas. On the other hand, in the group 17 to 18 years versus 13 to 14 years of age, cerebellum connectivity was higher with frontal lobe networks. This could imply a shift in cerebellar connectivity patterns from basic sensorimotor to higher-order cognitive functions. These results are consistent with a recent study that found age differences in cerebellar connectivity; maturation was associated with a shift from cerebellar sensorimotor connectivity to cerebellar cortical connectivity. We did not obtain evidence for a family history \u00d7 age group effect, suggesting that the basic pattern of age differences in internetwork connectivity was similar for both FHP and FHN groups.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28833, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These findings should be considered within the context of the following potential limitations. First, potential motion-related noise in the neuroimaging data may have influenced the results of ICA and subsequent examination of functional connectivity indices. However, careful pre-inspection of neuroimaging data was undertaken to eliminate artifacts, and ICA parses out noise-related variance when delineating components. FHP and FHN groups did differ on parental education, and although controlling for education did not alter the connectivity difference, it will be important for future studies to match FHN to FHP on education and other related variables. In addition, although our cross-sectional analyses found evidence for age differences in connectivity, a longitudinal design would be better suited to examine change in connectivity as a function of age and in relation to family history. Also, although we examined associations between number of family members with AUD and functional connectivity, we did not assess family history of other drug use disorders. Similarly, although we collected retrospective information from mothers about alcohol and drug use during pregnancy, a more extensive interview with the mothers may have provided additional information about substance use during pregnancy, potentially allowing for a more systematic investigation between family history, maternal use of alcohol and other drugs during pregnancy, and brain connectivity. From the data that we did have available, the reduced connectivity in the FHP group in premotor cortex was not modified after removing participants whose mothers reported alcohol or other drug use during pregnancy. In terms of substance use in the adolescent participants themselves, our inclusion criteria allowed some degree of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use, as these substances are commonly used during adolescence. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that some modest amount of past use may have altered functional connectivity. Future studies should study FHP children prior to adolescence when there is no substance use history. Indeed, some brain measures may show a more striking difference between FHP and FHN participants prior to adolescence. Our resting state scan, albeit at least as long as other resting state studies in FHP individuals, could have benefited from longer duration. Finally, because we used a data-driven ICA approach to examine connectivity across the entire set of brain voxels, we did not focus on specific brain regions. In addition, unlike region of interest based approaches, it is not possible to \u201cscrub\u201d individual time points of high motion data, as these analyses require all participants to have an equal number of time points of fMRI data.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31591, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "With these caveats in mind, our study, which to date is the largest study of resting state connectivity in FHP and FHN participants, found evidence for reduced sensorimotor network connectivity, a finding that was related to the number of family members with alcohol use and mood disorders. At the same time, family history group differences in connectivity were much weaker than the large number of internetwork connectivity differences that were found comparing participants 13 to 14 years of age to those 17 to 18 years of age.
