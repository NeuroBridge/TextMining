Although the psychiatric symptoms, especially for motivation and emotion, could be increased in schizophrenia, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We employed a longitudinal study to measure the alteration of striatum functional networks in schizophrenic subjects undergoing Mozart music listening using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Forty-five schizophrenic inpatients were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups. Under the standard care with antipsychotic medication, one group received music intervention for 1 month and the other group is set as control. Both schizophrenic groups were compared to healthy subjects. Resting-state fMRI was acquired from schizophrenic subjects at baseline and after one-month music intervention and from healthy subjects at baseline. Striatum network was assessed through seed-based static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC) analyses. After music intervention, increased static FC was observed between pallidum and ventral hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. Increased dynamic FCs were also found between pallidus and subregions of default mode network (DMN), including cerebellum crus and posterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, static pallidus-hippocampus FC increment was positively correlated with the improvement of negative symptoms in schizophrenic subjects. Together, these findings provided evidence that music intervention might have an effect on the FC of the striatum-DMN circuit and might be related to the remission of symptoms of schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1762, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Previous studies have indicated that music intervention might improve schizophrenic subjects' positive symptoms through normalizing the salience, sensorimotor, and visual networks, while there are few research studies investigating the relationship between improved negative symptom and altered functional feature within the brain network of schizophrenic subjects. One prominent theory documented that schizophrenic subjects are associated with increased subcortical dopamine. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia could be related to a hyperactive subcortical dopaminergic system. Excellent research has also revealed that abnormality in dopamine-mediated striatum system may be related to multiple deficient reward processing, which contributes to the negative symptoms of schizophrenic subjects. The striatum is differentiated into caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. These subregions of striatum receive and send back information with the cortex.
