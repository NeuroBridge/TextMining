Specifically, no prior work has investigated FC in individuals with APS using subregions of the AMY as seed regions of interest. The present study examined AMY subregion-based FC in individuals with APS and first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and healthy controls (HCs). The resting state FC maps of the three AMY subregions were computed and compared across the three groups. Correlation analysis was also performed to examine the relationship between the Z-values of regions showing significant group differences and symptom rating scores. Individuals with APS showed hyperconnectivity between the right centromedial AMY (CMA) and left frontal pole cortex (FPC) and between the laterobasal AMY and brain stem and right inferior lateral occipital cortex compared to HCs. Patients with FES showed hyperconnectivity between the right superficial AMY and left occipital pole cortex and between the left CMA and left thalamus compared to the APS and HCs respectively. A negative relationship was observed between the connectivity strength of the CMA with the FPC and negative-others score of the Brief Core Schema Scales in the APS group. We observed different altered FC with subregions of the AMY in individuals with APS and FES compared to HCs.

A leading hypothesis is that SZ is a brain disconnection syndrome involving abnormal interactions among widespread brain networks. Widespread network disconnectivity in SZ has been reported using both seed-based analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) with rs-fMRI data (for a review, see Ref.). More specifically, most seed-based studies have found decreased connectivity, whereas ICA studies have reported both increases and decreases. The medial frontal cortex (mPFC) has often been shown by both approaches to be involved in aberrant connectivity in SZ. The main findings of rs-fMRI studies in first-episode schizophrenia (FES) are similar. Robust regional brain changes were found in the prefrontal and temporal lobes, including decreased functional connectivity (FC) in the mPFC, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbital frontal cortex, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and increased or decreased FC in the temporal lobe, with prominence in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) (for a review, see Ref.).

Studies on the resting-state FC (rsFC) in subjects with APS is ongoing, and evidence is limited. Most previous FC studies have investigated networks seeded from a priori defined regions of interest (ROIs): the amygdala (AMY), cerebellum, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), striatum (ST), STG, and thalamus.

The laterobasal AMY (LBA) facilitates associative learning processes such as fear conditioning through afferent nerves from cortical and subcortical regions, including the thalamus, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. The centromedial AMY (CMA) plays an important role in generating behavioral responses through projections to the brainstem, as well as cortical and striatal regions, and facilitates attention to salient stimuli. The superficial AMY (SA) lies adjacent to the laterobasal group and includes the cortical nuclei involved in olfactory and affective processes. Despite the potential importance of understanding AMY-related dysfunction in APS and SZ, relatively few studies have directly examined alterations in AMY connectivity across the illness phases; only five studies on SZ and two studies on APS have done so. Of note, only two studies on SZ used subregions of the AMY as a seed ROI. Given the different roles of AMY subregions and the aberrant rsFC of specific AMY subregions in SZ, it is crucial to investigate rsFC in the AMY subregions of individuals with APS.

An earlier study of individuals at high risk for SZ identified no significantly altered FC relative to HCs using the AMY as a single ROI. However, if three subregions of the AMY had been used as seed ROIs, the results may have been different. The CMA plays a significant role in regulating attentional processing of cues during associative conditioning and generating emotional and associated physiological responses to threat or pain through projections to the brainstem, as well as the cortical and striatal regions. Stimulation of the central nucleus of the AMY leads to fast, desynchronized cortical EEG activity, which is associated with increased attention and vigilance. Projections from the central nucleus to the ventral tegmental area mediate stress-induced increases in dopamine metabolites in the prefrontal cortex. The FPC occupying the most anterior part of the prefrontal cortex is functionally correlated with the default mode network. Its role is specialized for disengaging cognitive control from the current task and re-distributing cognitive resources to other novel goals present in the environment. At-risk and symptomatic individuals for psychosis show abnormalities in both structure and activation of the FPC. Considering the functions of the CMA and FPC, our finding suggests that individuals with APS are in an increased state of attention and vigilance to novel stimuli in the environment.

Increased connectivity of the LBA with the brain stem is supported by a previous study reporting that increased AMY connectivity with a brainstem was found in individuals at high risk for SZ. The brainstem is home to a group of modulatory neurotransmitter pathways, such as those arising from the raphe nuclei (serotonergic), ventral tegmental area (dopaminergic), and locus coeruleus (noradrenergic), thereby controlling level-setting in sensory and arousal systems and emotional behaviors. The LOC is involved in face perception or object recognition. Therefore, our findings may be interpreted to indicate that individuals with APS who are exposed to negative facial stimuli are likely to exhibit physiological arousal. Unexpectedly, individuals with APS exhibited hypoconnectivity between the right CMA and right FPC compared to HCs. Several studies in which right FPC activity was measured via fMRI and EEG suggest that the right FPC plays a role in directed exploration. Hence, it may be that this decreased connectivity with right FPC could be associated with negative symptoms such as decreased exploration in individuals with APS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14659, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In patients with FES, increased levels of connectivity were observed between the right SA and left OPC and between the left CMA and left thalamus compared to individuals with APS and HCs, respectively. The SA is implicated in olfactory and affective processes particularly related to facial emotions. The occipital pole is the posterior-most part of the occipital lobe and is primarily responsible for visual processing. The traditional role of thalamus has been that of a passive relay station of information from sensory organs or subcortical structures to the cortex. However, its role has recently been extended to that of a critical hub region that could integrate diverse information being processed throughout the cerebral cortex as well as maintain the modular structure of cortical functional networks. Increased connectivity between the AMY and thalamus in patients with FES is a relatively unique finding considering most of the previous studies on SZ reported decreased connectivity in amygdalo- or thalamo-cortical circuits. Deficits in amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex coupling have been reported in both early course and chronic SZ. Even though we did not observe altered amygdalo-cortical connectivity in FES group, our key finding is an aberrant connectivity between the AMY and sensory information processing regions, i.e., OPC and thalamus. This may suggest that individuals with FES are hypervigilant via sensory stimulation including facial perception. Moreover, it is in line with previous studies reporting strong connections between the AMY and auditory regions of the cortex and thalamus as well as disrupted pathways from limbic areas to thalamus in SZ. Especially, it is interesting to note that strong connections between the AMY and auditory regions of the cortex and thalamus were shown in patients with SZ during the perception of aversive auditory stimuli mimicking the content of auditory verbal hallucinations. The scores of P3 (hallucinatory behavior) in the PANSS were 1.82\u2009\u00b1\u20091.01 and 3.68\u2009\u00b1\u20091.77 for the APS and FES groups respectively. Therefore, it may be speculated that increased connectivity between the AMY and thalamus is associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in the FES group.

This result seems counterintuitive considering our previous result from seed to voxel FC analysis, i.e. increased connectivity strength between the right CMA and left FPC in the APS group. A possible interpretation may be that although the strength of the connectivity between the CMA and FPC was stronger in individuals with APS than in HCs, greater connectivity is correlated with lower negative-others score within the APS group itself. Though clinical implication of inverse correlation within the APS group is ambiguous, it would be interesting to explore its relationship with conversion to psychosis. Alternatively, it may be that resting state brain activity does not reflect appropriately actual mental state, i.e., BCSS score and may be showing decompensated activity for negative schema. This study has several limitations. First, in the APS group, the sample size was small, and the sex ratio was male-biased. Second, because we used a cross-sectional design, there was no information about conversions to psychosis among individuals with APS. Therefore, the findings in APS should be interpreted cautiously. Third, some of the participants with FES were taking atypical antipsychotics, raising the possibility of a medication confound.

Especially for the CMA, increased connectivity with the FPC and thalamus was observed in the APS and FES groups, respectively. This suggests that the APS group may be hypervigilant to cognitive stimuli and FES group to sensory stimuli. Increased AMY connectivity with thalamus in the FES group may be associated with the development of auditory verbal hallucinations.
