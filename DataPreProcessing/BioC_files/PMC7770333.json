Convergently, ToM deficits, which are prevalent in schizophrenia and a well-established feature and vulnerability marker of this disorder, are known to associate with symptoms of disorganization. Abnormal neural activation in response to tasks targeting ToM has also been reported in schizophrenia involving temporo-parietal junction as well as prefrontal and temporal regions where the current ToM meta-network is distributed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25699, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It is interesting to note that the ToM network also predicted negative symptoms in the main sample though this did not generalize to the B-SNIP data. Given that the subnetworks of ToM predicting negative and cognitive dimensions, respectively, were largely divergent (Figure 3B, Figure S4), this resonates with the notion that ToM encompasses multiple components.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26063, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Intriguingly, cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia were also linked to socio-affective processes via the prediction using the eSAD network. This corroborates recent studies consistently linked neural activity patterns in the default-mode network (DMN) to cognitive abilities, and that the implication of the DMN-derived eSAD network in cognitive processing is hence unsurprising. Our finding moreover resonates well with a literature suggesting that socio-affective factors impact and modulate cognitive performance like working memory and attention in schizophrenia patients. The use of seemingly non-cognitive psychosocial methods has been proposed as a potential remediation strategy for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, and indeed successfully applied in practice. Consequentially, we would hypothesize that the cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia might relate to an impaired integration of self- and other-related processes. Since the interaction of the (core) DMN with other brain regions and networks is more reflective of schizophrenia symptoms than within-DMN connectivity, it is not surprising that the DMN was not predictive, but the eSAD was which comprises regions going beyond the DMN.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27270, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Molecular architecture of the networks robustly predicted cognitive dimension", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27348, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cognitive deficits are a lifelong burden for patients with schizophrenia because there are so few effective medications including mainstay anti-dopaminergic agents. In line with the notion that dopaminergic dysfunction alone doesn\u2019t account for the whole picture of schizophrenia psychopathology, here we revealed that the networks and nodes predictive of individual cognitive symptom-load are related to both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. These data extend previous region-of-interest analyses to a comprehensive topographical level and are supported by findings that cognitive deficits relate to D1 receptor elevation in schizophrenia. The current extension to a network-level investigation is important, as schizophrenia patients are characterized by dysconnection between distant brain regions and network-based analyses can nominate mechanisms of action for the development of novel pharmacological treatments. In line with involvement of dopamine functioning in cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, the cognitive dimension of psychopathology was associated with dopamine-synthesis-capacity. Increased dopamine-synthesis-capacity in schizophrenia was not only reported in the striatum but also cortical areas including prefrontal cortex where multiple nodes within the ToM and the eSAD networks are located.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28670, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Moreover, cognitive symptoms were linked to the density of 5-HTT, which plays a critical role in regulating serotonergic concentration and signaling. Serotonergic dysfunction and 5-HTT polymorphism have been involved in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Previous postmortem and in vivo PET studies have yielded inconsistent results on the alteration of 5-HTT density in schizophrenia, while an over-expression of 5-HTT mRNA in the prefrontal and temporal cortex has been demonstrated. We here revealed a potential role of 5-HTT in cognitive deficits via the networks involved in socio-affective processes, resonating with the proposed implication of 5-HTT in the affective domain. While atypical anti-psychotics including olanzapine and risperidone target also the 5-HT2a serotonin receptor, their effects on 5-HTT seems to be equivocal. Interestingly, anti-psychotic drugs, pimavanserin and SEP-363856 have just been introduced that preferentially target serotonin and not dopamine receptors, suggesting increased focus also on serotonergic pathways.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29719, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Limitations and Considerations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29750, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "First, the effect sizes for the correlation between the symptom scores and their predictions were moderate. However, despite the clinical complexity of the population and the heterogeneities in scanners and protocols, the effect sizes are similar to the previously reported for predicting, e.g., creativity, personality, and memory performance in healthy subjects (r-values mostly around 0.2-0.35). Since olanzapine-equivalent dosage did not correlate with symptom scores or alter the prediction pattern after additionally controlling for the dosage in cross-validation, medication would be largely a source of random variation in our data and hence make our results more conservative. Second, we acknowledge that task-specific changes in network topology and related dynamics may also explain the variance in individual symptoms and should be the scope of future studies to complement our resting-state findings. Third, although meta-analytically derived peak coordinates are the most likely location of specific functional networks, there may exist individual-specific topological differences which in turn may reflect pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning individual symptoms. Future studies assessing the contribution of individual-specific topology to the prediction of symptoms are desired. Forth, although glutamatergic dysfunction has been increasingly implicated in schizophrenia neurocognitive deficits, there are no publicly available in vivo maps reflecting the glutamatergic system. Fifth, within-subject (longitudinal) studies assessing symptoms, rs-FC and receptor densities are needed.
