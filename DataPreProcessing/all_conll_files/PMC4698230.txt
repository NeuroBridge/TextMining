as O
a O
seed O
to O
map O
thalamic O

the O

. O

The O
primary O
advantage O
of O
the O
first O
method O
is O
that O
it O
can O
map O
multiple O
thalamic O
networks O
and O
segment O
the O
thalamus O
according O
to O
its O
functional O

However O
, O
the O
use O

cortical O
ROIs O
limits O
spatial O
specificity O
within O
the O

. O

Using O
the O
whole O
thalamus O
as O
a O
seed O
overcomes O
this O
limitation O
, O
but O
, O
by O
averaging O
BOLD O
signals O
from O
the O
entire O
thalamus O
, O
precludes O
an O
analysis O
of O

thalamocortical O

. O

To O
overcome O
these O
limitations O
, O
we O
combined O
elements O
of O
both O

was O
calculated O
and O
compared O
