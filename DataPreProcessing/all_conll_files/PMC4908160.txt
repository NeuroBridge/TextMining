Dexamphetamine O
( O
dAMPH O
) O
is O
not O
only O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
attention O
deficit O
hyperactivity O
disorder O
( O
ADHD O
) O
, O
but O
also O
as O
a O
recreational O
drug O
. O

Acutely O
, O
dAMPH O
induces O
release O
of O
predominantly O
dopamine O
( O
DA O
) O
in O
the O
striatum O
, O
and O
in O
the O
cortex O
both O
DA O
and O
noradrenaline O
. O

Recent O
animal O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
chronic O
dAMPH O
administration O
can O
induce O
changes O
in O
the O
DA O
system O
following O
long-term O
exposure O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
reductions O
in O
DA O
transporters O
, O
D2/3 O
receptors O
and O
endogenous O

levels O
. O

However O
, O
only O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
studies O
have O
investigated O
the O
effects O
of O
dAMPH O
in O
the O
human O
brain O
. O

We O
used O
a O
combination O
of O

( O

) O
and O
[ O

( O

) O
in O
15 O
recreational O

20 O
matched O
healthy O

to O
investigate O
the O
short- O
, O
and O
long-term O
effects O
of O
AMPH O
before O
and O
after O
an O
acute O
intravenous O
challenge O
with O
dAMPH O
. O

We O
found O
that O
acute O
dAMPH O
administration O
reduced O
functional O
connectivity O
in O
the O
cortico-striatal-thalamic O
network O
. O

dAMPH-induced O
DA O
release O
, O
but O
not O
DA O
D2/3 O
receptor O
binding O
, O
was O
positively O
associated O
with O
connectivity O
changes O
in O
this O
network O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
acute O
dAMPH O
reduced O
connectivity O
in O
default O
mode O
networks O
and O
salience-executive-networks O
networks O
in O
both O
groups O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
our O
hypothesis O
, O
no O
significant O
group O
differences O
were O
found O
in O
any O
of O
the O
rs-fMRI O
networks O
investigated O
, O
possibly O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
sensitivity O
or O

Our O

the O
