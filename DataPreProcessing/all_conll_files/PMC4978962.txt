period O

brain O

characterized O
by O
hierarchical O
changes O
in O
the O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
young O
brain O
is O
particularly O
vulnerable O
to O
the O
toxic O
effects O
of O
alcohol O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
binge O

is O
a O
pattern O
of O
alcohol O

increasingly O
prevalent O
among O

. O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
is O
to O
evaluate O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
functional O
and O
anatomical O

The O

two O

displayed O

These O

point O
out O
that O

In O

In O
the O
intra-ROI O

we O

The O
procedure O
started O
by O
assessing O

by O

of O
ANCOVA O
with O

The O

assessed O
using O

, O
Only O
those O

were O
kept O
and O
included O
in O
the O
following O
steps O
of O
the O

. O

Then O
, O
we O
aimed O
to O
extract O
a O
robust O

network O
, O
so-called O
network O

These O
networks O
consisted O

We O

the O

i.e O

there O

The O

Then O
, O
we O
submitted O
all O
the O

composed O
the O

At O
this O
point O

we O
wanted O
to O
offer O
a O
value O

would O
characterize O
the O
network O

Thus O
, O
we O
calculate O
for O

their O

degree O
, O
i.e O
. O

the O
average O

across O
all O

Then O
we O
performed O
an O
ANCOVA O
with O

covariate O
between O
groups O
, O
which O
was O
corrected O
by O
multiplying O
the O

account O
for O
the O

Finally O
, O
we O
