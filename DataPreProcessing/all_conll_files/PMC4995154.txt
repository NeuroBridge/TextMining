remain O
a O
key O
puzzle O
in O
understanding O
the O
cognitive O
deficits O
and O
dysfunction O
of O
dorsolateral O
prefrontal O
cortex O
observed O
in O
the O
disorder O
. O

We O
sought O
to O
determine O
whether O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
exhibit O
an O
alteration O
in O
the O
inverted-U O
relationship O
between O
WM O
load O
and O
activation O
that O
we O
recently O
observed O
in O
healthy O
individuals O
, O
and O
whether O
this O
could O
account O
for O
WM O
deficits O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Methods O
Medicated O
( O
N=30 O
) O
and O
unmedicated O
( O
N=21 O
) O
patients O

( O
N=45 O
) O
performed O
the O
self-ordered O

We O
identified O
regions O

an O
altered O

an O
inverted-U O

WM O

Results O
A O
blunted O
inverted-U O
response O
was O
observed O
in O
left O
DLPFC O
in O
patients O
and O
was O
associated O
with O
behavioral O
deficits O
in O
WM O
capacity O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
suppression O
of O
medial O
prefrontal O
cortex O
( O
mPFC O
) O
during O
WM O
was O
reduced O
in O
patients O
, O
and O
was O
also O
associated O
with O
poorer O
WM O
capacity O
in O
patients O
. O

Finally O
, O
activation O
of O
visual O
cortex O
in O
the O
cuneus O
was O
elevated O
in O
patients O
and O
associated O
with O
improved O
WM O
capacity O
. O

Together O
, O
these O
findings O
explained O
55 O
% O
of O
the O
interindividual O
variance O
in O
WM O
capacity O
when O
combined O
with O
diagnostic O
and O

, O
which O
alone O
accounted O
for O
only O
22 O
% O
of O
the O
variance O

Conclusions O
These O
findings O
identify O
a O
novel O
biomarker O
and O
putative O
mechanism O
of O
WM O
deficits O
in O
patients O

schizophrenia O
, O
a O

Task O

been O
described O
previously O
. O

Briefly O
, O
eight O
line-drawings O
of O
difficult-to-verbalize O
objects O
were O
presented O
, O
and O
participants O
were O
instructed O
to O
select O
each O
object O
once O
, O
in O
any O
order O
. O

After O
each O
object O
was O
selected O
, O
all O
objects O
were O
pseudo-randomly O
rearranged O
on O
the O
screen O
. O

Participants O
then O
had O
to O
select O
an O
object O
not O
already O
selected O
, O
so O
that O
at O
each O
step O
there O
was O
one O
more O
previously-selected O
object O
to O
remember O
. O

A O
perceptual O
and O
motor O
control O
task O
was O
used O
following O
identical O
procedures O
, O
except O
that O
one O
object O
was O
marked O
with O
an O
asterisk O
and O
participants O
were O
instructed O
to O
simply O
select O
the O
marked O
object O
. O

Participants O
were O
paid O
$ O
0.25 O

correct O

for O
both O
tasks O
. O

Our O

Two O
primary O
outcome O
measures O
were O
calculated O
for O
each O
subject O

First O
, O
the O
fit O
to O
an O
empirical O
inverted-U O
shape O
( O
obtained O
from O
an O
independent O

; O

in O

) O
was O
calculated O
at O
each O
voxel O
for O
each O
participant O
. O

This O
fit O
was O
obtained O
by O
regressing O
observed O
task O
activation O
at O
each O
step O
on O
the O
inverted-U O
shape O
, O
such O
that O
larger O
positive O
values O
indicate O
better O
fit O
. O

Second O
, O
a O
task O
- O
control O
contrast O
was O
calculated O
as O
the O
average O
activation O
across O
the O
first O
seven O
steps O
of O
the O
SOT O
minus O
activation O
to O
the O
control O
task O
. O

Although O
we O
did O
not O
hypothesize O
a O
between-group O
difference O
in O
this O
contrast O
, O
it O
is O
a O
commonly O
used O
and O
straightforward O
measure O
of O
regional O
brain O
activation O
to O
the O
SOT O
relative O
to O
the O
control O
task O
