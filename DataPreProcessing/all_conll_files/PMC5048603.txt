Background O
Real-time O
functional O

This O

Methods/design O
Participants O
are O
alcohol-dependent O
patients O
who O
have O
completed O
a O
detoxification O
programme O
within O
the O
past O
6 O
months O
and O
have O
remained O
abstinent O
. O

Potential O
participants O
are O
screened O
for O
eligibility O
, O
and O
those O
who O
are O
eligible O
are O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
the O
treatment O
group O
( O
receiving O
rtfMRI O
NFT O
in O
addition O
to O
treatment O
as O
usual O
) O
or O
the O
control O
group O
( O
receiving O
only O
treatment O
as O
usual O
) O
. O

Participants O
in O
both O
groups O
are O
administered O
baseline O
assessments O
to O
measure O
their O
alcohol O
consumption O
and O
severity O
of O
dependence O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
psychological O
and O
behavioural O
characteristics O
that O
are O
hypothesised O
to O
predict O
success O
with O
rtfMRI O
NFT O
. O

During O
the O
following O
4 O
months O
, O
experimental O
participants O
are O
given O
six O
NFT O
sessions O
, O
and O
before O
and O
after O
each O
session O
various O
alcohol-related O
measures O
are O
taken O
. O

Participants O
in O
the O
control O
group O
are O
given O
the O
same O
measures O
to O
coincide O
with O
their O
timing O
in O
the O
experimental O
group O
. O

Eight O
and O
12 O
months O
after O
the O
baseline O
assessment O
, O
both O
groups O
are O
followed O
up O
with O
a O
battery O
of O
measures O
. O

The O
primary O
research O
questions O
are O
whether O
NFT O
can O
be O
used O
to O
teach O
participants O
to O
down-regulate O
their O
brain O
activation O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
alcohol O
stimuli O
or O
to O
up-regulate O
their O
brain O
activation O
in O
response O
to O
pictures O
related O
to O
healthy O
goal O
pursuits O
, O
and O
, O
if O
so O
, O
whether O
this O
translates O
into O
reductions O
in O
alcohol O
consumption O
. O

The O
primary O
outcome O
measures O
will O
be O
those O
derived O
from O
the O
functional O
brain O
imaging O
data O
. O

We O
are O
interested O
in O
improvements O
( O
i.e. O
, O
reductions O
) O
in O
participants O
’ O
alcohol O
consumption O
from O
pretreatment O
levels O
, O
as O
indicated O
by O
three O
continuous O
variables O
, O
not O
simply O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
person O
has O
remained O
abstinent O
. O

The O
indices O
of O
interest O
are O
percentage O
of O
days O
abstinent O
, O
drinks O
per O
drinking O
day O
, O
and O
percentage O
of O
days O
of O
heavy O
drinking O
. O

General O
linear O
models O
will O
be O
used O
to O
compare O
the O
NFT O
group O
and O
the O

group O
on O
these O
measures O

For O
each O
alcohol-related O
picture O
, O
participants O
are O
asked O
to O
indicate O
( O
by O
using O
the O
mouse O
to O
move O
the O
cursor O
along O
a O
visual O
analogue O
scale O
on O

) O
how O
much O
this O
specific O
picture O
makes O
them O
want O
a O
drink O
of O
alcohol O
; O
response O
options O
range O
from O
not O
at O
all O
to O
very O
strongly O
. O

Using O
the O
same O
response O
modalities O
, O
participants O
rate O
each O
of O
the O
pictures O
related O
to O
an O
alternative O
goal O
with O
regard O
to O
how O
much O
it O
reminds O
them O
of O
a O
positive O
goal O
that O
they O
are O
currently O
pursuing O
. O

For O
each O
of O
the O
subsequent O
NFT O
sessions O
in O
which O
alcohol-related O
pictures O
are O
down-regulated O
or O
alternative O
goal-related O
pictures O
are O
up-regulated O
, O
the O
pictures O
are O
randomly O
selected O
from O
the O
14 O
pictures O
in O
each O
category O
that O
the O
participant O
rated O
most O
highly O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
stimulus O
sets O
are O
tailored O
to O
each O
participant O
’ O
s O
specific O
drinking O
preferences O
and O
hierarchy O
of O
alternative O
goals O
. O

The O
NFT O
involves O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
( O
MRI O
) O
during O
which O
patients O
lie O
on O
a O
movable O
bed O
inside O
the O
bore O
of O
an O
MRI O
scanner O
. O

Before O
entering O
the O
MRI O
suite O
, O
patients O
undergo O
a O
detailed O
MRI O
safety O
screening O
( O
as O
described O
earlier O
) O
, O
including O
a O
determination O
of O
potential O
safety O
hazards O
( O
see O
exclusion O
criteria O
) O
and O
the O
removal O
of O
all O
metal O
objects O
, O
such O
as O
keys O
or O
jewellery O
, O
from O
their O
body O
. O

While O
in O
the O
scanner O
, O
participants O
in O
the O
experimental O
group O
are O
again O
exposed O
to O
alcohol-related O
stimuli O
, O
such O
as O
pictures O
of O
alcoholic O
drinks O
, O
and O
they O
are O
trained O
to O
regulate O
their O
responses O
in O
specific O
brain O
regions O
that O
are O
activated O
by O
the O
stimuli O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
participants O
are O
exposed O
to O
pictures O
showing O
alternative O
, O
socially O
desirable O
goals O
, O
such O
as O
family/relationships O
or O
employment O
. O

The O
rationale O
for O
including O
the O
two O
categories O
of O
stimuli O
is O
that O
we O
earlier O
demonstrated O
at O
a O
neural O
level O
that O
heavy O
drinking O
is O
associated O
with O
overvaluation O
of O
alcohol O
and O
undervaluation O
of O
alternative O
, O
socially O
desirable O
goals O
. O

Moreover O
, O
consistent O
with O
motivational O
theory O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
problem O
drinkers O
’ O
success O
in O
reducing O
their O
drinking O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
they O
have O
other O
satisfying O
alternative O
goals O
to O
pursue O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
size O
of O
the O
images O
that O
participants O
see O
corresponds O
to O
the O
level O
of O
activation O
. O

They O
are O
told O
to O
use O
any O
kind O
of O
mental O
strategy O
at O
their O
disposal O
( O
e.g O
. O

thinking O
about O
the O
negative O
consequences O
of O
drinking O
) O
that O
helps O
to O
reduce O
size O
of O
the O
image O
( O
in O
the O
case O
of O
alcohol O
pictures O
) O
or O
increase O
size O
of O
the O
image O
and O
thereby O
the O
degree O
of O
brain O
activation O
( O
in O
the O
case O
of O

goal-related O
pictures O
) O
