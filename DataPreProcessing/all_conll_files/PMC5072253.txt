Background O
: O
Previous O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
interhemispheric O
functional O
connectivity O
alterations O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

However O
, O
the O
relationship O
between O
these O
alterations O
and O
the O
disease O
state O
of O
schizophrenia O
is O
largely O
unknown O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
this O
relationship O
using O
voxel-mirrored O
homotopic O
connectivity O
( O
VMHC O
) O
method O
. O

Methods O
: O
This O
study O
enrolled O
36 O
schizophrenia O
patients O
with O
complete O
remission O
, O
58 O
schizophrenia O
patients O
with O
incomplete O
remission O
and O
55 O
healthy O

. O

The O
VMHC O
was O
calculated O
based O
on O
resting-state O
functional O
magnetic O

imaging O
data O
. O

Differences O
in O
VMHC O
among O
three O
groups O
were O
compared O
using O
one-way O
analysis O
of O
variance O
. O

A O
brain O
region O
with O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
VMHC O
was O
defined O
as O
a O
region O
of O
interest O
( O
ROI O
) O
, O
and O
the O
mean O
VMHC O
value O
in O
the O
ROI O
was O
extracted O
for O
the O
post O

analysis O
, O
i.e. O
, O
pair-wise O
comparisons O
across O
the O
three O
groups O
. O

Results O
: O
VMHC O
in O
the O
visual O
region O
( O
inferior O
occipital O
and O
fusiform O
gyri O
) O
and O
the O
sensorimotor O
region O
( O
paracentral O

showed O
significant O

among O

three O

( O

) O
. O

Pair-wise O
comparisons O
in O
the O
post O

analysis O
showed O
that O
VMHC O
of O
the O
visual O
and O
sensorimotor O
regions O
in O
schizophrenia O
patients O
with O
complete O
remission O
and O
incomplete O

was O
lower O
than O
that O
in O
healthy O
controls O
( O
P O

; O
however O
, O
there O
was O
no O

between O
the O
two O
patient O
subgroups O
. O

Conclusions O
: O
Interhemispheric O
functional O
connectivity O
in O
the O
sensorimotor O
and O
visual O
processing O
pathways O
was O
reduced O
in O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
, O
but O
this O
reduction O
was O
unrelated O
to O
the O
disease O
state O
; O
thus O
, O
this O
reduction O
may O
serve O
as O
a O
trait O
marker O
of O
schizophrenia O
