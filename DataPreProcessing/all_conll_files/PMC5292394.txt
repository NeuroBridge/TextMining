Introduction O

The O
present O
study O
was O
intended O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effects O
of O
a O
rehabilitative O
training O
, O
the O
Cognitive O
Pragmatic O

( O
CPT O
) O
, O
aimed O
at O
improving O
communicative-pragmatic O
abilities O
and O
the O
related O
cognitive O
components O
, O
on O
the O
cerebral O
modifications O
of O
a O
single O
case O
patient O
diagnosed O
with O
schizophrenia O
. O

Methods O
. O

The O
patient O
underwent O
two O
functional O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
( O
fMRI O
) O
sessions O
, O
before O
and O
after O
the O
treatment O
. O

In O
order O
to O
assess O
brain O
changes O
, O
we O
calculated O
the O
Amplitude O
of O
Low O
Frequency O
Fluctuation O
( O
ALFF O
) O
index O
of O
the O
resting-state O
fMRI O
signal O
, O
which O
is O
interpreted O
as O
reflecting O
the O
intensity O
of O
the O
spontaneous O
regional O
activity O
of O
the O
brain O
. O

Behavioural O
measures O
of O
the O
patient O
's O
communicative O
performance O
were O
also O
gathered O
before O
and O
after O
training O
and O
at O
follow-up O
. O

Results O
. O

The O
patient O
improved O
his O
communicative O
performance O
in O
almost O
all O
tests O
. O

Posttraining O
stronger O
ALFF O
signal O
emerged O
in O
the O
superior O
, O

, O
and O

, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
superior O

. O

Conclusions O
. O

Even O
if O
based O
on O
a O
single O
case O
study O
, O
these O
preliminary O
results O
show O
functional O
changes O
at O
the O
cerebral O
level O
that O
seem O
to O

The O
Cognitive O
Pragmatic O
Treatment O
The O
patient O
took O
part O
in O
the O
CPT O
, O
and O
he O
underwent O
the O
fMRI O
scanning O
before O
and O
after O
treatment O
. O

The O
CPT O
lasted O
10 O
weeks O
and O
it O
was O
structured O
in O
two O
sessions O
per O
week O
, O
each O
one O
lasting O
90 O
minutes O
. O

Patients O
attended O
the O
sessions O
in O
small O
groups O
of O
five/six O
, O
led O
by O
a O
psychologist O
. O

The O
treatment O
mainly O
concentrated O
on O
the O
different O
expressive O
modalities O
of O
communication O
, O
that O
is O
, O
linguistic O
, O
extralinguistic O
, O
paralinguistic O
, O
social O
appropriateness O
, O
and O
conversational O
abilities O
. O

Moreover O
, O
other O
sessions O
were O
focused O
on O
aspects O
such O
as O
awareness O
, O
theory O
of O
mind O
, O
and O
planning O
, O
which O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
a O
role O
to O
play O
in O
communicative O
performance O
. O

The O
training O
provided O
the O
patients O
with O
an O
ecological O
setting O
where O
they O
were O
encouraged O
to O
exercise O
their O
communicative O
abilities O
and O
learn O
how O
to O
face O
typical O
situations O
of O
everyday O
interactions O
; O
this O
goal O
was O
realized O
through O
self-monitoring O
strategies O
and O
feedback O
provided O
by O
the O
therapist O
. O

Communicative-pragmatic O
difficulties O
displayed O
by O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
are O
related O
to O
their O
difficulties O
in O
filling O
the O
gap O
between O
what O
is O
literally O
said O
and O
what O
is O
meant O
, O
as O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
indirect O
speech O
acts O
and O
figurative O
language O
( O
e.g. O
, O
) O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
many O
activities O
along O
the O
training O
were O
focused O
on O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
partner O
's O
intended O
meaning O
starting O
from O
the O
expressed O
literal O
message O
. O

Specific O
attention O
was O
also O
given O
to O
the O
ability O
to O
interpret O
and O
use O
nonverbal O
and O
paralinguistic O
cues O
, O
such O
as O
facial O
expression O
and O
the O
tone O
of O
voice O
, O
in O
order O
to O
identify O
the O
correct O
speaker O
's O
communicative O
intention O
; O
irony O
, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
characterized O
by O
specific O
paralinguistic O
cues O
that O
help O
a O
person O
to O
distinguish O
it O
from O
deceit O
. O

Moreover O
, O
frequently O
these O
patients O
have O
difficulty O
in O
modulating O
their O
speech O
according O
to O
the O
contextual O
information O
. O

This O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
many O
activities O
of O
the O
training O
were O
focused O
on O
the O
ability O
to O
decode O
violations O
of O
the O
conversational O
implicatures O
and O
to O
avoid O
digressions O
and O
derailments O
. O

Behavioural O
Measures O
The O
communicative-pragmatic O
abilities O
of O
the O
patient O
were O
measured O
through O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
equivalent O
forms O
of O
ABaCo O
before O
and O
after O
treatment O
. O

The O
equivalent O
forms O
of O
the O
ABaCo O
have O
shown O
a O
good O
internal O
consistency O
, O
a O
good O
correlation O
between O
forms O
, O
and O
an O
excellent O
interrater O
agreement O
. O

They O
are O
comprised O
of O
four O
evaluation O
scales O

that O
is O

linguistic O
, O
extralinguistic O
, O

, O
and O

, O
aimed O
at O
assessing O
the O
main O
pragmatic O
components O
of O
communication O
. O

Each O
scale O
is O
divided O
into O
two O
subscales O

The O

At O

The O

the O

Using O
the O

we O
transformed O

Afterwards O
, O
the O

Then O
the O
filtered O

have O
been O
transformed O
into O
a O

with O
the O

this O

allows O
decomposing O

. O

The O

represents O
the O

We O
then O
calculated O
the O

( O

of O
the O

The O
