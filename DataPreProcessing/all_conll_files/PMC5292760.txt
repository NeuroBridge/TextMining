Reality O
monitoring O
impairment O
is O
often O
reported O
in O
schizophrenia O
but O
the O
neural O
basis O
of O
this O
deficit O
is O
poorly O
understood O
. O

Difficulties O
with O
reality O
monitoring O
could O
be O
attributable O
to O
the O
same O
pattern O
of O
neural O
dysfunction O
as O
other O
cognitive O
deficits O
that O
characterize O
schizophrenia O
, O
or O
might O
instead O
represent O
a O
separable O
and O
dissociable O
impairment O
. O

This O
question O
was O
addressed O
through O
direct O
comparison O
of O
behavioral O
performance O
and O
neural O
activity O
associated O
with O
reality O
monitoring O
and O
working O
memory O
in O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
and O
matched O
healthy O
controls O
. O

Participants O
performed O
a O
word-pair O
reality O
monitoring O
task O
and O
a O
Sternberg O
working O
memory O
task O
while O
undergoing O
fMRI O
scanning O
. O

Distinct O
behavioral O
deficits O
were O
observed O
in O
the O
patients O
during O
performance O
of O
each O
task O
, O
which O
were O
associated O
with O
separable O
task- O
and O
region-specific O
dysfunction O
in O
the O
medial O
anterior O
prefrontal O
cortex O
for O
reality O
monitoring O
and O
dorsolateral O
prefrontal O

for O

. O

The O
results O
suggest O
that O
reality O
monitoring O
impairment O
is O
a O
distinct O
neurocognitive O
deficit O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

The O
findings O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
range O
of O
dissociable O
cognitive O
