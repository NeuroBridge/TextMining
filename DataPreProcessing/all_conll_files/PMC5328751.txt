It O
is O
important O
to O
choose O
an O
appropriate O
P-threshold O
to O
define O
PGRS O
and O
methods O
are O
proposed O
to O
choose O
the O
threshold O
. O

However O
, O
since O
this O
is O
a O
data O
driven O
study O
without O
predefined O
phenotypes O
, O
this O
method O
could O
not O
work O
on O
our O
study O
. O

A O
more O
stringent O
threshold O
generates O
a O
SNP O
set O
with O
less O
SNPs O
being O
truly O
associated O
with O
the O
disorders O
. O

With O
a O
more O
liberal O
threshold O
, O
more O
SNPs O
will O
be O
included O
, O
which O
will O
help O
increase O
the O
statistical O
power O
. O

But O
too O
liberal O
threshold O
will O
include O
SNPs O
that O
are O
too O
weakly O
associated O
with O
the O
disorders O
. O

So O
the O
statistical O
power O
will O
decrease O
. O

Among O
these O
four O
thresholds O
, O
PT O
< O
0.05 O
could O
be O
a O
balance O
of O
statistical O
power O
and O
the O
number O
of O
SNPs O
. O

So O
our O
research O
was O
primarily O
based O
on O
the O
PGRS O
calculated O
at O
PT O
< O
0.05 O
, O
and O
we O
analyzed O
PGRS O
at O
other O
thresholds O
based O
on O
the O
results O
of O
PT O
< O
0.05 O
. O

We O
calculated O
the O
PGRS O
using O
the O
method O
described O
in O
a O
previous O
paper O
. O

First O
we O
calculated O
the O
cross-disorder O

then O
calculated O
