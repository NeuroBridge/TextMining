Schizophrenia O
Individuals O
with O

demonstrate O
difficulties O
in O
attending O
to O
important O
stimuli O
( O
e.g. O
, O

) O
and O
ignoring O
distractors O
( O
e.g. O
, O
non-targets O
) O
. O

We O
used O
a O
visual O
oddball O
task O
during O
fMRI O
to O
examine O
functional O
connectivity O
within O
and O
between O
the O
ventral O

dorsal O
attention O
networks O
to O
determine O
the O
relative O
contribution O
of O
each O
network O
to O
detection O
of O

in O

. O

The O
sample O
comprised O
25 O
schizophrenia O

27 O
healthy O

. O

Psychophysiological O
interaction O

was O
used O
to O
examine O
whole-brain O

We O
used O
the O
right O

) O
as O
the O
seed O
region O
for O
the O
ventral O

the O

intraparietal O
sulcus O
( O
IPS O
) O
as O
the O
seed O

We O
found O
that O
connectivity O

( O

; O
a O
component O

. O

Expected O
patterns O
of O

for O

were O
observed O
in O

, O
and O
not O
significantly O

These O
findings O
indicate O
functional O

deficits O
between O
the O

in O

that O
may O
