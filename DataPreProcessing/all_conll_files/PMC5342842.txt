The O
Role O
of O
Attentional O
Engagement O
Individuals O
with O
schizophrenia O
exhibit O
problems O
in O
language O
comprehension O
that O
are O
most O
evident O
during O
discourse O
processing O
. O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
deficits O
in O
cognitive O
control O
contribute O
to O
these O
comprehension O
deficits O
during O
discourse O
processing O
, O
and O
investigated O
the O
underlying O
cognitive-neural O
mechanisms O
using O
EEG O
( O
alpha O
power O
) O
and O
ERPs O
( O
N400 O
) O
. O

N400 O
amplitudes O
to O
globally O
supported O
or O
unsupported O
target O
words O
near O
the O
end O
of O
stories O
were O
used O
to O
index O
sensitivity O
to O
previous O
context O
. O

ERPs O
showed O
reduced O
sensitivity O
to O
context O
in O
patients O
versus O
controls O
. O

EEG O
alpha-band O
activity O
was O
used O
to O
index O
attentional O
engagement O
while O
participants O
listened O
to O
the O
stories O
. O

We O
found O
that O
context O
effects O
varied O
with O
attentional O
engagement O
in O
both O
groups O
, O
as O
well O
as O
with O
negative O
symptom O
severity O
in O
patients O
. O

Both O
groups O
demonstrated O
trial-to-trial O
fluctuations O
in O
alpha O
. O

Relatively O
high O
alpha O
power O
was O
associated O
with O
compromised O
discourse O
processing O
in O
participants O
with O
schizophrenia O
when O
it O
occurred O
during O
any O
early O
portion O
of O
the O
story O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
discourse O
processing O
was O
only O
compromised O
in O
controls O
only O
when O
alpha O
was O
relatively O
high O
for O
longer O
segments O
of O
the O
stories O
. O

Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
shifts O
in O
attention O
from O
the O
story O
context O
may O
be O
more O
detrimental O
to O
discourse O
processing O
for O
participants O
with O
schizophrenia O
than O
for O
controls O
, O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
an O
impaired O
ability O
to O
benefit O
from O

context O
. O

Task O
Stimuli O
The O
stimuli O
consisted O
of O
80 O
story O
sets O
. O

A O
set O
was O
comprised O
of O
two O
conditions O
of O
the O
same O
story O
: O
Animate O
and O
Inanimate O
. O

Stories O
were O
translated O
from O
Dutch O
to O
English O
and O
adapted O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
current O
study O
from O
those O
used O
in O
. O

Each O
story O
contained O
4 O
sentences O
. O

For O
all O
stories O
, O
an O
inanimate O
, O
cartoon-like O
character O
was O
introduced O
in O
the O
first O
sentence O
( O
e.g O
. O

a O
peanut O
that O
is O
described O
as O
happy O
and O
smiling O
) O
. O

The O
passages O
were O
written O
so O
that O
each O
sentence O
reinforced O
that O
the O
normally O
inanimate O
object O
( O
e.g. O
, O
the O
peanut O
) O
served O
as O
an O
animate O
character O
in O
this O
context O
. O

This O
was O
accomplished O
by O
references O
in O
the O
first O
three O
sentences O
to O
the O
character O
using O
pronouns O
reserved O
for O
animate O
characters O
( O
he/she O
) O
, O
and O
by O
the O
use O
of O
verbs O

likewise O
reserved O

characters O
( O
e.g O
. O

the O
peanut O
had O
a O
big O
smile… O
; O
the O
peanut O
was O
amazed… O
) O
. O

Then O
, O
in O
sentence O
4 O
, O
the O
character O
was O
described O
using O
a O
critical O
word O
that O
requires O
an O
animate O
or O
inanimate O
object O
to O
fill O
one O
of O
its O
thematic O
roles O
. O

This O
critical O
word O
was O
therefore O
consistent O
with O
either O
the O
immediately O
preceding O
context O
( O
cartoon-style O
context-Animate O
critical O
word O
) O
, O
or O
inconsistent O
( O
cartoon-style O
context-Inanimate O
critical O
word O
) O
. O

Inanimate O
critical O
words O
were O
chosen O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
the O
most O
typical O
, O
non-cartoon-style O
meaning O
of O
the O
inanimate O
objects O
that O
served O
as O
the O
animate O
character O
. O

The O
critical O

Therefore O
