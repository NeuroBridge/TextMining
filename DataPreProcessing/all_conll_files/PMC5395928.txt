is O
widely O
linked O

the O

, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
regulating O

, O

Over O
the O
past O
two O

, O
neuroimaging O
has O
provided O
significant O
contributions O
revealing O
functional O

We O
first O
presented O
a O

investigation O
to O
examine O
local O

through O
resting-state O
functional O

( O

using O

from O

( O

) O
and O
seven O

in O
a O

. O

We O
discovered O
that O
the O

manifested O

rsFC O
. O

Moreover O
, O
small-worldness O
was O
explored O
in O

In O
addition O
to O
the O

our O

The O

provides O
important O

the O

Interhemispheric O

analysis O
We O
used O
interhemispheric O
correlations O
to O
demonstrate O
the O
long-range O
connectivity O
of O
the O
right O
and O
left O
lateral O
OFC O
( O
lOFC O
) O
and O
medial O
OFC O
( O
mOFC O
) O
in O
both O
the O
HDs O
and O

. O

All O
ROIs O
within O
the O
OFC O
were O
investigated O
for O
local O
connectivity O
between O
the O
right O
and O
left O
hemispheres O
( O
see O
Supplementary O
Table O
S2 O
) O
. O

The O
typical O
patterns O
observed O
in O
the O
cortical O
blood O
flow O
during O
brain O
activation O
are O
an O
increase O
in O
HbO O
and O
a O
decrease O
in O
Hb O
. O

As O
the O
regions O
covered O
by O
the O
channels O
were O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other O
anatomically O
, O
we O
assume O
that O
the O
long-range O
activation O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
the O
connectivity O
because O
the O
interhemispheric O
correlations O
analysis O
is O
designed O
to O
study O
a O
long-distance O
brain O
connectivity O
that O
is O
likely O
connected O
to O
the O
intravascular O
( O
HbO O

events O

Therefore O
both O

were O

Functional O

whole-brain O
correlation O
analyses O
To O
analyze O
the O
rsFC O
of O
the O
HDs O
and O
CGs O
, O
we O
used O
two O
approaches O
: O
( O
1 O
) O
a O
seed-based O
correlation O
analysis O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
a O
whole-brain O
correlation O
analysis O
. O

The O
former O
approach O
was O
used O
in O
order O
to O
estimate O
and O
detect O
the O
strength O
of O
pairwise O
relationships O
between O
a O
predefined O
seed O
channel O
and O
other O
channels O
covering O
other O
OFC O
regions O
. O

This O
allowed O
us O
to O
identify O
intrinsic O
functional O
connectivity O
in O
different O
OFC O
region O
systems O
. O

The O
second O
approach O
aimed O
to O
compute O
a O
functional O
connectivity O
map O
between O
any O
two O
channel O
pairs O
in O
the O
entire O
OFC O
system O
, O
where O
the O
measurement O
channels O
represented O
nodes O
, O
and O
the O
functional O
connections O
with O
correlation O
coefficients O
greater O
than O
a O
predefined O
threshold O
were O
considered O
edges O
. O

The O
change O
in O
HbO O
concentration O
is O
recognized O
to O
be O
the O
most O
responsive O
indicator O
of O
differences O
in O
cortical O
blood O
flow O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
HbO O
signals O
would O
be O
responsive O
enough O
to O
indicate O
changes O
in O
the O
local O
activity O
in O
the O
regions O
covered O
by O
the O
channels O
that O
were O
not O
far O
apart O
from O
each O
other O
as O
abovementioned O
. O

For O
simplicity O
, O
HbO O
was O
therefore O
considered O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
analyses O
. O

The O
Hb O
data O
was O
served O
as O
a O
reference O
only O
when O
needed O
. O

The O
gambling O

data O
were O
processed O
using O
a O
general O
linear O

to O
estimate O
the O
task-induced O

The O

The O

used O
included O
small-world O

In O

These O
global O
network O
metrics O
provided O
a O
global O
topological O
framework O
of O
the O
whole-brain O
network O
, O
taking O
into O

all-channel O

In O

nodal O
network O

the O
nodal O

These O

Traditionally O

a O
small-world O

is O
one O
where O
the O
clustering O
coefficient O
of O
a O

is O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
a O
random O
network O
and O
where O
the O
path-length O
is O
characteristically O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
a O
random O
graph O
. O

Thus O
, O
normalization O
of O
clustering O
coefficients O
and O
path-length O
are O
traditionally O
computed O
with O
respect O
to O
random O
networks O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
uncommon O
to O
compare O

Intuitively O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
this O
tradition O
, O
we O
wanted O
to O
explore O
whether O
the O
HD O
network O
is O
“ O
small-world O
” O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
CG O
network O
; O
thus O
, O
small-worldness O
was O
computed O
by O
comparing O
the O
HDs O
with O
the O
CGs O
( O
i.e. O
, O

As O

this O
preliminary O
investigation O
may O
provide O
a O

access O
“ O
