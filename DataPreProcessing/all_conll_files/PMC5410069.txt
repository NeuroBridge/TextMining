Background O
Alcohol O
use O
disorder O
and O
depression O
occur O
commonly O
in O
the O
community O
. O

Even O
though O
this O
high-prevalence O
comorbidity O
is O
associated O
with O
poorer O
posttreatment O
outcomes O
and O
greater O
utilization O
of O
costly O
treatment O
services O
, O
existing O
treatment O
trials O
often O
exclude O
patients O
with O
comorbid O
depressive O
and O
alcohol O
use O
disorders O
. O

Past O
research O
suggests O
that O
symptoms O
such O
as O
craving O
and O
anhedonia O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
alterations O
within O
the O
reward O
circuit O
, O
while O
emotion O
regulation O
deficits O
are O
related O
to O
disruptions O
within O
the O
default O
mode O
network O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
clinical O
neuroimaging O
study O
is O
to O
transfer O
previous O
research O
about O
the O
reward O
circuit O
and O
default O
mode O
network O
underlying O
alcohol O
use O
disorder O
and O
depression O
to O
achieve O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
neural O
signatures O
characterizing O
their O
comorbidity O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
neurobiological O
results O
will O
be O
used O
to O
test O
whether O
two O
psychotherapeutic O
intervention O
programs O
, O
mindfulness-based O
training O
and O
behavioral O
activation O
training O
, O
are O
able O
to O
positively O
influence O
the O
identified O
pathomechanisms O

either O

and O
asked O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
second O

and O
3 O

. O

Thereby O
, O
we O
plan O
to O
explore O
whether O
these O
brief O
group O
psychotherapeutic O
intervention O
programs O
are O
able O
to O
positively O
influence O
the O
identified O
neurobiological O
pathomechanisms O

The O
primary O
outcomes O
are O

and O
connectivity O
evoked O
by O
paradigms O
measuring O
different O
facets O
of O
reward O
and O
emotion O

. O

Secondary O
outcome O
measures O
include O
craving O
and O
depression O
scores O
, O
as O

as O
relapse O

. O

Predictors O
include O

Discussion O
The O
objective O
of O
the O
project O
is O
to O
identify O
common O
and/or O
distinct O
neural O
signatures O
underlying O
the O
comorbidity O
of O
alcohol O
dependence O
and O
depression O
. O

If O
the O
neurobiological O
understanding O
of O
alcohol O
addiction O
and O
depression O
is O
improved O
, O
this O
could O
potentially O
serve O
as O
a O
key O
predictor O
of O
treatment O
response O
to O
specific O
types O
of O
behavioral O
or O
mindfulness O
therapies O
hypothesized O
to O
alter O
reward O
and O

The O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
neurobiological O
underpinnings O
is O
to O
develop O
preventive O
and O
more O
effective O
treatment O
strategies O
. O

Compared O
to O
antidepressant O
or O
anticraving O
medication O
, O
less O
research O
has O
examined O
functional O
neural O
responses O
after O
psychotherapy O
. O

Available O
data O
suggest O
that O
psychotherapy O
predicts O
metabolic O
changes O
in O
reward O
, O
cingulate O
and O
frontal O
cortices O
in O
alcohol O
dependence O
and O
depression O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
only O
a O
few O
studies O
evaluated O
the O
effects O
of O
a O
specific O
psychotherapeutic O
intervention O
like O
the O
brief O
Behavioral O
Activation O
Treatment O
( O
BAT O
) O
for O
depression O
on O
brain O
activation O
. O

Dichter O
and O
colleagues O
report O
functional O
changes O
in O
reward O
associated O
structures O
including O
the O
dorsal O
striatum O
during O
reward O
anticipation O
after O
a O
BAT O
intervention O
but O
did O
not O
include O
a O
depressed O
control O
group O
. O

Looking O
on O
the O
DMN O
connectivity O
, O
Crowther O
and O
colleagues O
found O
that O
the O
response O
to O
BAT O
in O
depressed O
patients O
was O
predicted O
by O
pretreatment O
connectivity O
of O
the O
right O
insula O
with O
the O
right O
middle O
temporal O
gyrus O
and O
the O
left O
intraparietal O
sulcus O
. O

Another O
psychotherapeutic O
intervention O
with O
potential O
effects O
on O
resting O
state O
networks O
is O
mindfulness O
based O
therapy O
( O
MBT O
) O
. O

MBT O
is O
a O
meditation O
practice O
that O
is O
recently O
receiving O
growing O
attention O
for O
its O
potential O
clinical O
applications O
in O
the O
context O
of O
alcohol O
dependence O
and O
depression O
. O

Neuroimaging O
studies O
showed O
that O
long-term O
meditators O
showed O
increased O
activation O
of O
prefrontal O
areas O
during O
meditation O
as O
compared O
with O
a O
rest O
condition O
or O
with O
matched O
control O
subjects O
naïve O
to O
meditation O
practice O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
dysfunctions O
in O
the O
reward O
circuit O
, O
as O
well O
as O
DMN O
have O
been O
identified O
as O
key O
domains O
underlying O
alcohol O
dependence O
and O
depression O
. O

We O
assume O
that O
these O
mechanisms O
also O
characterize O
the O
neurobiological O
underpinning O
of O
their O
comorbidity O
. O

Thereby O
, O
the O
identification O
of O
neural O
risk O
factors O
associated O
with O
their O
co-occurrence O
might O
help O
in O
understanding O
the O
pathophysiological O
mechanisms O
leading O
to O
their O
onset O
and O
course O
. O

The O
overall O
goal O
of O
improving O
our O
understanding O
of O
neurobiological O
mechanisms O
is O
to O
improve O
treatment O
. O

If O
the O
neurobiological O
understanding O
of O
alcohol O
dependence O
and O
depression O
is O
improved O
, O
this O
could O
potentially O
serve O
as O
a O
key O
predictor O
of O
treatment O
response O
to O
specific O
types O
of O
behavioral O

Resting O

paradigm O
The O
so O
called O
mood O

paradigm O
has O
been O
successfully O
implemented O
in O
different O
studies O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
will O
use O
a O

version O
of O
the O
paradigm O
in O
order O
to O
directly O
test O
intervention O
associated O

. O

The O
paradigm O
consists O
of O
five O
blocks O
, O
each O
of O
which O
lasts O
4.5 O
min O
: O
a O

The O
mindfulness-based O
block O
and O
the O

block O
are O
counterbalanced O
. O

During O
the O

phase O
, O
participants O
are O
told O
to O
keep O
their O

During O
the O

Participants O
are O
asked O
to O
concentrate O
on O
the O

with O
the O

. O

During O
the O

In O
the O
mindfulness- O

phase O
, O
again O
, O
participants O
are O

they O
listen O
to O
mindfulness-based O
audio O
instructions O
. O

Correspondingly O
, O
in O
the O
behavioral O
activation O
training O
phase O
, O
participants O
are O
played O
audio O
instructions O
associated O
with O
imagining O
activities O
while O
viewing O
alcohol-associated O
pictures O
. O

In O
each O
phase O
, O
9 O
alcohol-associated O
cues O
are O
presented O
for O
15 O
s O
, O
while O
simultaneously O
9 O
audio O
statements O
are O
played O
. O

After O
each O
picture O
a O
fixation O
cross O
is O
presented O
for O
also O
15 O
s. O
After O
each O
block O
, O
participants O
are O
instructed O
to O
rate O
their O
mood O
by O
means O
of O
the O
Positive O
and O
Negative O
Affect O
Schedule O
( O
PANAS O
) O
, O
as O

as O
their O

For O
the O
T2 O
assessment O
, O
a O

set O
of O
alcohol-associated O

As O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
mindfulness-based O
block O
and O
the O
behavioral O

are O
counterbalanced O
