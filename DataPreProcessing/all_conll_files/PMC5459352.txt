Schizophrenia O
is O
a O
disease O
with O
disruptions O
in O
thought O
, O
emotion O
, O
and O
behavior O
. O

The O
dysconnectivity O
hypothesis O
suggests O
these O
disruptions O
are O
due O
to O
aberrant O
brain O
connectivity O
. O

Many O
studies O
have O
identified O
connectivity O
differences O
but O
few O
have O
been O
able O
to O
unify O
gray O
and O
white O

findings O
into O
one O
model O
. O

Here O
we O
develop O
an O
extension O
of O
the O
Network-Based O
Statistic O
( O
NBS O
) O
called O
NBSm O
( O
Multimodal O
Network-based O
statistic O
) O
to O
compare O
functional O
and O
anatomical O

in O
schizophrenia O
. O

Structural O

data O
were O
collected O
from O
29 O

. O

Images O

and O
average O

were O
extracted O
for O
90 O
regions O
of O

( O

. O

Functional O

were O
estimated O
by O
pairwise O

. O

Following O

of O
ROIs O
. O

Global O
and O
regional O

were O
calculated O
for O
each O

. O

NBSm O
was O
used O
to O
find O
significant O
overlap O
between O
functional O
and O
anatomical O
components O
that O
distinguished O
health O
from O
schizophrenia O
. O

Global O
strength O
was O
decreased O
in O
patients O
in O
both O
functional O
and O
anatomical O

. O

Regional O
strength O
was O
decreased O
in O
all O
regions O
in O
functional O
networks O
and O
only O
one O
region O
in O
anatomical O
networks O
. O

NBSm O
identified O
a O
distinguishing O
functional O
component O
consisting O
of O
46 O
nodes O
with O
113 O

( O

and O
a O
distinguishing O
intermodal O
component O
with O
26 O

( O
p O
< O
0.001 O

. O

NBSm O
is O
a O
powerful O
technique O
for O
understanding O
network-based O
group O
differences O
present O
in O
both O
anatomical O
and O
functional O
data O
. O

In O
light O
of O
the O
dysconnectivity O
hypothesis O
, O
these O
results O
provide O
compelling O
evidence O
for O
the O
presence O
of O

in O

A O
novel O

for O

The O
methodology O
extends O

In O
this O

we O

The O

An O

A O

Since O

Once O

each O

The O
