that O

individuals O
have O
an O
attenuated O

relative O

that O
this O

Results O
Cocaine-dependent O

Conclusion O
The O
dampened O
neural O
response O
to O
typically O
arousing O
stimuli O
among O
cocaine-dependent O
polydrug O
users O
suggests O
decreased O
salience O
processing O
for O
nondrug O
stimuli O
, O
particularly O
among O
female O
users O
. O

This O
decreased O
responding O
is O
consistent O
with O
data O
from O
other O
substance O
using O
populations O
and O
suggests O
that O
this O
may O
be O
a O
general O
feature O
of O
addiction O
. O

Amplifying O
the O
