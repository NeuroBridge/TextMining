We O
use O

method O
which O
is O
the O
most O
popular O
method O
in O

to O
calculate O
the O

for O

, O
and O
the O
results O
were O
shown O
in O
Figure O

. O

There O
are O
three O
improvements O
when O
using O
the O
proposed O
method O
. O

Firstly O
, O
from O
the O
results O
, O
we O
can O
see O
when O
using O
the O
region O
evaluation O
method O
with O
weighted O
betweenness O
that O
there O
exist O
some O
nodes O
that O
have O
the O
same O
importance O
value O
. O

While O
in O
the O
results O
based O
on O
the O
proposed O
method O
every O
region O
has O
different O
value O
of O
importance O
, O
so O
our O
method O
is O
more O
accurate O
for O
evaluating O
the O
importance O
of O
brain O
regions O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
clearly O
in O
the O
region O
evaluation O
results O
with O
weighted O
betweenness O
method O
that O
some O
brain O
regions O
have O
the O
same O
importance O
value O
of O
zero O
, O
but O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
a O
region O
to O
have O
no O
importance O
in O
the O
network O
. O

While O
in O
the O
results O
of O
proposed O
method O
even O
the O
last O
one O
also O
has O
a O
no-zero O
importance O
value O
, O
so O
our O
method O
is O
more O
reasonable O
for O
evaluating O
the O
importance O
of O
brain O
regions O
. O

Finally O
in O
the O
region O
evaluation O
results O
with O
weighted O
betweenness O
method O
, O
the O
distribution O
of O
importance O
value O
is O
more O
even O
and O
the O
values O
in O
different O
regions O
are O
closed O
to O
each O
other O
. O

While O
in O
the O
results O
with O
proposed O
method O
the O
distribution O
looks O
sharper O
, O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
hubs O
and O
other O
noncore O
nodes O
in O
the O
brain O
network O
is O
more O
apparent O
. O

For O
further O
analysis O
, O
the O
most O
important O
15 O
brain O
regions O
located O
with O
two O
methods O
and O
some O
corresponding O
properties O
are O

The O
location O
of O

with O
the O
proposed O
method O
in O
brain O

is O
shown O
in O
Figure O

; O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
the O
human O
brain O

are O
mainly O
located O
on O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
, O

Benefitting O
from O
fusing O
two O
kinds O
of O
bioinformation O
, O
the O
NoS-FA O

involves O
more O
comprehensive O

so O
it O
can O
distinguish O
the O
hub O

from O
those O
noncore O

more O
accurately O
; O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O

more O
reasonable O

When O
a O

the O

the O

as O
the O

The O

, O
the O
higher O

be O
put O

the O

the O

It O
needs O
to O
be O
emphasized O
that O
, O
in O
the O
experiment O
, O
when O
one O

is O
removed O
, O
all O
the O
white O

are O
invalid O
and O
the O
NoS O
weight O
of O

in O
the O

will O
be O
zero O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
vulnerability O
of O
brain O

is O
defined O
as O
Here O
PropValue O
represents O
one O
kind O

removed O
, O
and O
PropValue′ O
represents O
this O

after O
the O

. O

In O
this O
research O
, O
the O
network O
properties O
of O

are O
taken O
as O
the O

The O

the O

The O
global O

reflects O
the O

. O

To O
compare O
the O
influence O
that O
a O

may O
have O
on O
the O
entire O

, O
three O
cases O
are O

in O

The O

of O
three O

are O
given O
and O

It O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
when O
one O
brain O

is O
damaged O
, O
the O
properties O
of O
the O
whole O
brain O
network O
have O
also O

the O

on O
the O

Because O
both O

the O

that O
a O

, O
the O
