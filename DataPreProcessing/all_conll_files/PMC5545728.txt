Little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
psychobiological O
mechanisms O
of O
cognitive O
behavioural O
therapy O
for O
psychosis O
( O
CBTp O
) O
and O
which O
specific O
processes O
are O
key O
in O
predicting O
favourable O
long-term O
outcomes O
. O

Following O
theoretical O
models O
of O
psychosis O
, O
this O
proof-of-concept O
study O
investigated O
whether O
the O
long-term O
recovery O
path O
of O
CBTp O
completers O
can O
be O
predicted O
by O
the O
neural O
changes O
in O
threat-based O
social O
affective O
processing O
that O
occur O
during O
CBTp O
. O

We O
followed O
up O
22 O
participants O
who O
had O
undergone O
a O
social O
affective O
processing O
task O
during O
functional O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
along O
with O
self-report O
and O
clinician-administered O
symptom O
measures O
, O
before O
and O
after O
receiving O
CBTp O
. O

Monthly O
ratings O
of O
psychotic O
and O
affective O
symptoms O
were O
obtained O
retrospectively O
across O
8 O
years O
since O
receiving O
CBTp O
, O
plus O
self-reported O
recovery O
at O
final O
follow-up O
. O

We O
investigated O
whether O
these O
long-term O
outcomes O
were O
predicted O
by O
CBTp-led O
changes O
in O
functional O
connections O
with O
dorsal O
prefrontal O
cortical O
and O
amygdala O
during O
the O
processing O
of O
threatening O
and O
prosocial O
facial O
affect O
. O

Although O
long-term O
psychotic O
symptoms O
were O
predicted O
by O
changes O
in O
prefrontal O
connections O
during O
prosocial O
facial O
affective O
processing O
, O
long-term O
affective O
symptoms O
were O
predicted O
by O
threat-related O
amygdalo-inferior O
parietal O
lobule O
connectivity O
. O

Greater O
increases O
in O
dorsolateral O
prefrontal O
cortex O
connectivity O
with O
amygdala O
following O
CBTp O
also O
predicted O
higher O
subjective O
ratings O
of O
recovery O
at O
long-term O
follow-up O
. O

These O
findings O
show O
that O
reorganisation O
occurring O
at O
the O
neural O
level O
following O
psychological O
therapy O
can O
predict O
the O
subsequent O
recovery O
path O
of O
people O
with O
psychosis O
across O
8 O
years O
. O

This O
novel O
methodology O
shows O
promise O
for O
further O
studies O
with O
larger O
sample O

, O
which O
are O
needed O
to O
better O
examine O
the O

Functional O

As O
described O
in O

were O
presented O
with O
monochrome O

and O
had O
to O
indicate O
the O

These O

repeated O
in O

Changes O

Significant O

For O
the O

we O

on O
the O
change O
in O
DLPFC-amygdala O

because O
of O
the O
