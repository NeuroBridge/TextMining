Abstract O
Background O
Evidence O
for O
olfactory O
dysfunction O
in O
schizophrenia O
has O
been O
firmly O
established O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
typical O
understanding O
of O
schizophrenia O
, O
olfaction O
is O
not O
recognized O
to O
contribute O
to O
or O
interact O
with O
the O
illness O
. O

Despite O
the O
solid O
presence O
of O
olfactory O
dysfunction O
in O
schizophrenia O
, O
its O
relation O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
illness O
remains O
largely O
unclear O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
aimed O
to O
examine O
functional O
connectivity O
of O
the O
olfactory O
bulb O
, O
olfactory O
tract O
, O
and O
piriform O
cortices O
and O
isolate O
the O
network O
that O
would O
account O
for O
the O
altered O
olfaction O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

Methods O
We O
examined O
the O
functional O
connectivity O
of O
these O
specific O
olfactory O
regions O
in O
order O
to O
isolate O
other O
brain O
regions O
associated O
with O
olfactory O
processing O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

Using O
the O
resting O

functional O

data O
from O
the O
Center O

Biomedical O
Research O
Excellence O
in O
Brain O

Mental O
Illness O
, O
we O
compared O
84 O
patients O
of O
schizophrenia O
and O
90 O
individuals O
without O
schizophrenia O
. O

Results O
The O
schizophrenia O
group O
showed O
disconnectivity O
between O
the O
anterior O
piriform O
cortex O
and O
the O
nucleus O
accumbens O
, O
between O
the O
posterior O
piriform O
cortex O
and O
the O
middle O
frontal O
gyrus O
, O
and O
between O
the O
olfactory O
tract O
and O
the O
visual O
cortices O
. O

Conclusions O
The O
current O
results O
suggest O
functional O
disconnectivity O
of O
olfactory O
regions O
in O
schizophrenia O
, O
which O
may O
account O
for O
olfactory O
dysfunction O
and O
disrupted O
