Estimating O

using O
GIG-ICA O
We O
applied O
GIG-ICA O
to O
the O

data O
of O
all O

to O
estimate O

, O
resulting O
in O
INs O
with O

across O
subjects O
while O
also O
retaining O
subject-specific O
network O
features O
. O

Our O
method O
primarily O
involved O
the O
following O
three O
steps O
. O

First O
, O
based O
on O
the O
temporally-concatenated O
fMRI O
data O
of O
181 O
subjects O
, O
ICA O
with O
the O
Infomax O
algorithm O
was O
used O
to O
estimate O
the O
group-level O
ICs O
. O

In O
order O
to O
decrease O
the O
influence O
of O
random O
initializations O
, O
we O
performed O
ICASSO O
with O
20 O
ICA O
runs O
followed O
by O
selection O
of O
the O
most O
reliable O
ICA O
run O
to O
obtain O
reliable O
group-level O
ICs O
. O

Before O
the O
group-level O
ICA O
, O
subject-level O
and O
group-level O
PCAs O
were O
applied O
to O
reduce O
the O
dimensionality O
of O
the O
fMRI O
data O
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
the O
number O
of O
ICs O
was O
set O
to O
30 O
based O
on O
previous O
work O
, O
and O
the O
number O
of O
principle O
components O
used O
in O
the O
subject-level O
PCAs O
was O
specified O
as O
a O
greater O
number O
( O
i.e. O
, O
60 O
) O
as O
recommended O
. O

Thus O
, O
30 O
group O
-level O
ICs O
were O
obtained O
and O
Z-scored O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
the O
sign O
of O
each O
resulting O
group-level O
IC O
is O
arbitrary O
. O

In O
our O
study O
, O
we O
computed O
the O
skewness O
of O
each O
IC O
and O
flipped O
the O
IC O
if O
its O
skewness O
was O
negative O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
positive O
Z-scores O
in O
each O
IC O
represented O
the O
voxels O
contributing O
the O
most O
to O
the O
associated O
network O
. O

Second O
, O
we O
manually O
identified O
the O
meaningful O
group-level O
networks O
after O
carefully O
inspecting O
all O
group-level O
ICs O
' O
spatial O
maps O
. O

If O
the O
primary O
activation O
of O
one O
IC O
's O
spatial O
map O
is O
located O
in O
gray O
matter O
, O
smooth O
and O
continuous O
, O
we O
preferred O
to O
regard O
it O
as O
an O
interesting O
functional O
network O
. O

Also O
, O
we O
referred O
to O
networks O
reported O
in O
previous O
studies O
to O
further O
confirm O
. O

The O
removed O
noise-related O
group-level O
ICs O
reflected O
head O
motion O
, O
physiological O
noise O
, O
and O
influence O
of O
scanner O
. O

Third O
, O
the O
remaining O
meaningful O
group-level O
ICs O
were O
characterized O
as O
the O
group-level O
INs O
and O
then O
used O
to O
calculate O
the O
subject-specific O
INs O
based O
on O
a O
multi-objective O
function O
optimization O
algorithm O
. O

GIG-ICA O
automatically O
yields O
Z-scored O
the O
subject-specific O
INs O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
regression O
model O
was O
utilized O
to O
estimate O
the O
corresponding O
time O
courses O
( O
reflecting O
fluctuations O
) O
of O
the O
individual O
INs O
for O
each O
subject O
's O
fMRI O
data O
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
for O
each O
voxel O
in O
a O
given O
individual O
IN O
, O
a O
positive O
Z-score O
indicates O
that O
the O
time O
series O
( O
after O
preprocessing O
) O
in O
the O
voxel O
has O
a O
positive O
correlation O
with O
the O
time O
course O
of O
the O
IN O
; O
in O
contrast O
a O
negative O
Z-score O
represents O
that O
the O
time O
series O
in O
the O
voxel O
has O
a O
negative O
correlation O
with O
the O
time O
course O
of O
the O
IN O
. O

Therefore O
, O
for O
one O
specific O
IN O
, O
a O
region O
containing O
voxels O
with O
high O
positive O
Z-scores O
( O
taking O
a O
region O
only O
including O
two O
voxels O
as O
an O
example O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
10 O
and O
9 O
) O
tends O
to O
have O
stronger O
co-activation O
( O
i.e. O
, O
positive O
correlation O
) O
within O
the O
IN O
compared O
to O
a O
region O
containing O
voxels O
with O
low O
positive O
Z-scores O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
2 O
and O
1 O
) O
. O

In O
such O
case O
, O
the O
mean O
of O
the O
Z-scores O
in O
one O
region O
can O
reflect O
the O
co-activation O
extent O
of O
the O
region O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
if O
a O
region O
contains O
voxels O
with O
greater O
negative O
Z-scores O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
− O
10 O
and O
− O
9 O
) O
relative O
to O
the O
other O
region O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
− O
2 O
and O
− O
1 O
) O
, O
the O
former O
also O
tends O
to O
have O
stronger O
co-activation O
than O
the O
later O
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
considering O
that O
the O
positive O
Z-scores O
contributing O
the O
most O
include O
important O
spatial O
maps O
in O
each O
IN O
, O
we O
focused O
on O
investigating O
group O
differences O
in O
voxels O
primarily O
associated O
with O
positive O
Z-scores O
to O
simplify O
the O
subsequent O
analyses O
. O

It O
is O
also O
worth O
pointing O
out O
that O
if O
one O
region O
includes O
both O
higher O
and O
lower O
positive O
Z-scores O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
10 O
and O
1 O
) O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
region O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
2 O
and O
8 O
) O
, O
we O
can O
not O
determine O
which O
region O
has O
greater O
co-activation O
using O
Z-scores O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
this O
work O
, O
we O
applied O
two-sample O
t-tests O
( O
rather O
than O
analysis O
of O
variance O
) O
to O
identify O
brain O
regions O
including O
voxels O
with O
consistent O

between O

we O

most O

The O

Additionally O
, O
we O

our O

So O
, O
we O

For O

as O

the O
parameter O

We O

In O
the O
second O

we O
defined O
19 O
non-overlapping O

that O
reflect O
all O

based O
on O
statistical O

results O
from O

then O
identified O
regions O

voxels O

Specifically O
, O
for O

we O
performed O
two-tailed O
two-sample O
t-tests O

) O
on O

Z-score O
for O
three O

groups O
( O

, O
CHR O

) O
and O
then O
examined O
whether O
its O

one O
of O
19 O

Among O
the O
19 O
patterns O
, O
two O
patterns O
( O

corresponded O
to O
strictly O

strictly O

For O
example O
, O
for O
the O

required O
for O
both O

Four O
patterns O
( O

1C–F O
) O
involved O
situations O
where O
the O

For O

Six O
additional O
patterns O
( O

2G–L O
) O
were O
CHR-unique O
alteration O

patterns O
in O
which O
the O
CHR O

had O
significantly O
lower O
or O
higher O
Z-scores O

two O

For O

in O

of O

, O
we O
required O

groups O
. O

There O
were O
also O
six O
patterns O
( O
Fig O

1M–R O
) O
in O
which O
only O
one O
pair O
of O
groups O
showed O
a O
group O

. O

Taking O
the O
HC O

ESZ O
pattern O
for O
an O
example O
, O
t-value O

0 O
for O
the O
HC O

ESZ O
comparison O
and O
no O
group O

for O
other O
comparisons O
were O
required O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
no-difference O
pattern O
( O
Fig O
. O

2S O
) O
was O
possible O
, O
where O
all O
three O
groups O
showed O
no O
significant O
differences O
( O
i.e. O
, O
p O
> O
0.05 O
for O
all O
comparisons O
) O
. O

Regarding O
each O
pattern O
, O
the O
associated O
voxels O
were O
identified O
and O
then O
corrected O
( O
p O
< O
0.05 O
) O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
using O
Monte O

simulation O
( O
N O
= O
1000 O
) O
to O
obtain O
regions O
each O
of O
which O
were O
spatially O
continuous O
. O

Thus O
, O
each O
remaining O
region O
was O
required O
to O
have O
a O
size O
greater O
than O
a O
given O
voxel O
number O
that O
was O
determined O
by O
the O
threshold O
p O
< O
0.05 O

the O

the O
voxel-wise O
one-sample O
t-tests O

1000 O
Monte O

simulations O
. O

Except O
for O
the O
last O
pattern O
representing O
no O
significant O
difference O
across O
groups O
, O
we O
named O
the O
identified O
regions O
as O
significant O
discriminative O
regions O
( O

within O
the O

INs O

In O
our O
work O
, O
we O
applied O
two-tailed O
two-sample O
t-tests O
to O
define O
the O
changing O
patterns O
because O
we O
can O
not O
make O
a O
hypothesis O
that O
one O
group O
( O
e.g. O
, O

) O
shows O
higher O
( O
or O
lower O
) O
Z-scores O
in O
network O
than O
the O
other O
group O
( O
e.g. O
, O

. O

We O
are O
testing O
for O
the O
possibility O
of O
the O
relationship O
in O
both O
directions O
( O
i.e. O
, O
the O

In O
the O
third O
step O
, O
for O
each O
SDR O
including O
voxels O
with O
the O
same O
pattern O
in O
a O

we O
tested O
whether O
its O
co-activation O

significantly O
among O
the O
HC O

Based O

from O
the O
above O
mentioned O
voxel-wise O
two-sample O
t-tests O

different O
voxels O

we O
applied O
a O

measure O
the O

for O
any O

Since O

proposed O
originally O
under O
an O

we O
also O
performed O
a O
non-parametric O

The O

The O

If O
