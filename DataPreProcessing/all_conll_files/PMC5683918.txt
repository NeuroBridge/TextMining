A O
pilot O
study O
Background O
Individuals O
who O
use O
cocaine O
have O
fewer O
cognitive O
resources O
needed O
to O
maintain O
abstinence O
. O

This O
is O
evidenced O
by O
blunted O
brain O
function O
during O
cognitive O
control O
tasks O
and O
reduced O
communication O
between O
brain O
regions O
associated O
with O
cognitive O
function O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
relapse O
vulnerability O
is O
heightened O
in O
individuals O
with O
less O
communication O
between O
the O
right O
and O
left O
frontoparietal O
executive O
control O
network O
( O
ECN O
) O
. O

Given O
that O
recent O
cocaine O
use O
enhances O
such O
communication O
, O
it O
is O
plausible O
that O
recency O
of O
cocaine O
use O
influences O
interhemispheric O
ECN O
communication O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
ECN O
communication O
weakens O
over O
the O
course O
of O
early O
cocaine O
abstinence O
, O
which O
may O
then O
enhance O
relapse O
risk O
. O

Methods O
In O
ten O
men O
with O
cocaine O
use O
disorder O
, O
we O
conducted O
a O
preliminary O
assessment O
of O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
number O
of O
days O
since O
last O
cocaine O
use O
( O
1–3 O
days O
) O
and O
interhemispheric O
ECN O
coupling O
using O
resting O
state O
functional O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
( O
fMRI O
) O
. O

Results O
Reduced O
interhemispheric O
ECN O
coupling O
was O
associated O
with O
increasing O
days O
since O
last O
cocaine O
use O
; O
weaker O
coupling O
was O
also O
associated O
with O
lower O
urine O
cocaine O
metabolite O
concentrations O
. O

This O
association O
was O
more O
prominent O
in O
prefrontal O
than O
parietal O
ECN-subregions O
. O

Conclusions O
Preliminary O
results O
indicate O
that O
resting O
state O
interhemispheric O
ECN O
coupling O
weakens O
within O
the O
first O
few O
days O
following O
last O
cocaine O
use O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
known O
link O
between O
reduced O
ECN O
interhemispheric O
coupling O
and O
relapse O
vulnerability O
, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
relapse O
risk O
may O
increase O
the O
longer O
an O
individual O
abstains O
during O
an O
early O
quit O
attempt O
. O

Treatments O
focused O
on O
reversing O
this O
coupling O
deficit O
may O
facilitate O
abstinence O
