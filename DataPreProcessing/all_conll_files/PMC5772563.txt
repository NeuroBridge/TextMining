Previously O
, O
task-based O
fMRI O
and O
resting-state O
EEG O
studies O
have O
revealed O
that O
craving O
, O
a O
critical O
component O
of O
addiction O
, O
is O
linked O
to O
abnormal O
activity O
in O
cortical O
regions O
including O
the O

cortex O
( O

, O

. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
we O
combine O
these O
two O
imaging O
techniques O
to O
investigate O
a O
group O
of O
alcohol-addicted O
patients O
and O
provide O

for O
the O
neural O
correlates O
of O
craving O
not O
only O
in O

in O

We O
observe O

are O
consistent O
with O

in O

We O
further O
observe O
