Combining O

data O
for O
searching O

in O
schizophrenia O
Identification O
of O
imaging O
biomarkers O
for O
schizophrenia O
is O
an O
important O
but O
still O
challenging O
problem O
. O

Even O
though O
considerable O
efforts O
have O
been O
made O
over O
the O
past O
decades O
, O
quantitative O
alterations O
between O
patients O

have O
not O
yet O
provided O
a O
diagnostic O
measure O
with O
sufficient O
high O
sensitivity O
and O
specificity O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
important O
reasons O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
consistent O
findings O
, O
which O
is O
in O
part O
due O
to O
single-mode O
study O
, O
which O
only O
detects O
single O
dimensional O
information O
by O
each O
modality O
, O
and O
thus O
misses O
the O
most O
crucial O
differences O
between O
groups O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
hypothesize O
that O
multimodal O
integration O
of O
functional O
MRI O
( O
fMRI O
) O
, O
structural O
MRI O
( O
sMRI O
) O
, O
and O
diffusion O
tensor O
imaging O
( O
DTI O
) O
might O
yield O
more O
power O
for O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
schizophrenia O
. O

A O
novel O
multivariate O
data O
fusion O
method O
for O
combining O
these O
modalities O
is O
introduced O
without O
reducing O
the O
dimension O
or O
using O
the O
priors O
from O
161 O
schizophrenia O
patients O
and O
168 O
matched O
healthy O
controls O
. O

The O
multi-index O
feature O
for O
each O
ROI O
is O
constructed O
and O
summarized O
with O
Wilk O
's O
lambda O
by O
performing O
multivariate O
analysis O
of O
variance O
to O
calculate O
the O
significant O
difference O
between O
different O
groups O
. O

Our O
results O
show O
that O
, O
among O
these O
modalities O
, O
fMRI O
has O
the O
most O
significant O
featureby O
calculating O
the O
Jaccard O
similarity O
coefficient O
( O
0.7416 O
) O
and O

( O
0.4833 O
) O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
fusion O
of O
these O
modalities O
provides O
the O
most O
plentiful O
information O
and O
the O
highest O
predictive O
accuracy O

This O
work O
indicates O
that O
multimodal O
integration O
can O
improve O
the O
ability O
of O
distinguishing O
differences O
between O
groups O
and O
might O
be O
assisting O
in O

Since O

SVM O
has O

the O

SVM O

that O

Diversity O

As O

, O
a O

have O
indicated O
that O

In O

measure O

, O
we O
use O
Jaccard O

to O
achieve O
these O
goals O
. O

The O
Jaccard O

The O

is O
the O
relative O

among O

When O

we O
can O
obtain O
fMRI O

The O

we O

Suppose O

In O

the O
contribution O
of O

we O
use O
R2 O

defined O
by O
Cox O

to O
describe O
how O
well O
the O
features O
Xi O
fit O
a O
set O
of O
observations O
( O
i.e. O

. O

We O
denote O

, O
as O
the O
R2 O

of O
four O

when O
we O
use O
fusion O
, O
fMRI O
, O
sMRI O

and O

as O

We O
define O
the O
contribution O

to O
fusion O
data O
as O
the O
ratio O

R2 O
of O
each O
