Abstract O
Naltrexone O
, O
an O
opioid O
receptor O
antagonist O
, O
is O
commonly O
used O
as O
a O
relapse O
prevention O
medication O
in O
alcohol O
and O
opiate O
addiction O
, O
but O
its O
efficacy O
and O
the O
mechanisms O
underpinning O
its O
clinical O
usefulness O
are O
not O
well O
characterized O
. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
, O
we O
examined O
the O
effects O
of O
50‐mg O
naltrexone O
compared O
with O
placebo O
on O

with O

alcohol O
and O

revealed O
that O

functional O

of O

compared O
with O
both O
poly‐drug‐dependent O
and O

observed O
in O

Naltrexone O
normalized O
heightened O
local O

the O

, O

the O

as O

Naltrexone O
failed O
to O
have O
an O

on O

Across O

. O

These O
findings O
suggest O
one O
possible O
mechanism O
for O

clinical O

of O

, O
namely O
