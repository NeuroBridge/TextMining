Abnormalities O

have O
been O
studied O
by O
examining O

However O
, O
the O

( O

) O
vary O
depending O
on O
the O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
and O
how O
these O

are O
inter-related O
. O

In O
order O
to O
assess O
relationships O
between O
abnormal O
patterns O
of O
FC O
during O
intrinsic O
activity O
and O
those O
during O

, O
we O
adopted O
a O

For O
the O

we O

Specifically O

The O
