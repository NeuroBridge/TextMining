Hypercoupling O

to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
generation O

( O

; O
however O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
this O
hypercoupling O
extends O
to O

. O

We O
investigated O
this O
by O
comparing O
schizophrenia O
patients O
with O

without O

Data O
from O

simultaneously O
analyzed O
using O
group O

for O
fMRI O
( O

, O
which O
allowed O

comparison O

across O

tasks O
while O
holding O
the O

constant O

leading O
to O
determination O
of O
the O
degree O
to O
which O

are O
common O
to O

, O
and O
which O
show O

Three O

emerged O
: O

Combining O
the O
AO O
and O
sentence O
tasks O
allowed O
the O
auditory-motor O

networks O
to O
separately O
emerge O
, O
whereas O
they O
were O
aggregated O
when O
individual O
tasks O
were O
analyzed O

AVH O
patients O
showed O
greater O

( O
deactivity O
for O

) O
than O
non-AVH O
patients O
during O
SP O
in O
all O
networks O
, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
extend O
to O
VTG O
or O

. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
hypercoupling O
in O
AVH O
patients O
in O
speech-perception-related O
brain O
networks O
is O
specific O
to O
perceived O

does O
not O
