Three O

interest O
( O

Results O
Abstinence-induced O
physiological O
, O
subjective O
, O

cognitive O

were O
observed O
. O

Overall O

was O
reduced O
during O

as O

Specifically O
, O
dorsal O
and O
posterior O
insular O
connections O
to O
the O

enhanced O
, O
while O
a O

Further O
, O

Conclusions O
As O

, O
divergent O

observed O
