The O

examines O
39 O
male O

with O
different O

of O
cocaine O
addiction O
and O
long-term O

( O
from O

) O
and O
evaluates O
plausible O
changes O
in O
brain O
structure O
and O
function O
of O
specific O
brain O
regions O
that O
sub-serve O

. O

These O
include O
the O
striatum O
that O
is O
involved O
in O
cocaine O
reward O
; O
the O
lateral O

( O

the O

) O
that O
plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O

; O
the O

which O

been O

shown O
to O
play O
key O

The O

that O
there O
are O

Examination O
of O
possible O
neural O
changes O
after O

suggests O
that O
presumed O
recovery O
occurs O
mostly O
in O
neural O
systems O
related O
to O

, O
but O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
in O

Given O
the O
limitations O
of O
the O
data O
in O
terms O
of O
a O
small O
sample O
size O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
lack O
of O
certainty O
about O
occasional O
use O
in O
the O
abstinent O
group O
, O
these O
results O
may O
be O
considered O
as O
preliminary O
. O

However O
, O
they O
are O
compelling O
in O
that O
they O
suggest O
that O
male O
military O
veterans O
cocaine O
USERS O
are O
indefinitely O
at O
a O
higher O
risk O
for O
making O
lapses O
in O
judgment O
and O
decision-making O
leading O
to O
possible O
relapse O
, O
if O
reward O
salience O
and O
craving O
become O
more O
intense O
. O

Understanding O
the O
neurobiology O
of O
long-term O
cocaine O

in O
vulnerable O

Since O
the O

we O
first O
examined O
