Background O
Functional O
dysconnectivity O
has O
been O
proposed O
as O
a O
major O
pathophysiological O
mechanism O
for O
cognitive O
dysfunction O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

The O
hippocampus O
is O
a O
focal O
point O
of O
dysconnectivity O
in O
schizophrenia O
, O
with O
decreased O
hippocampal O
functional O
connectivity O
contributing O
to O
the O
marked O
memory O
deficits O
observed O
in O
patients O
. O

Normal O
memory O
function O
relies O
on O
the O
interaction O
of O
complex O
cortico-hippocampal O
networks O
. O

However O
, O
only O
recent O
technological O
advances O
have O
enabled O
the O
large-scale O
exploration O
of O
functional O
networks O
with O
accuracy O
and O
precision O
. O

Methods O
We O
investigated O
the O
modularity O
of O
hippocampal O
resting-state O
functional O
networks O
in O
a O
sample O
of O
45 O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
spectrum O
disorders O
and O
38 O
healthy O
control O
subjects O
. O

Modularity O
was O
calculated O
for O
two O
distinct O
functional O
networks O
: O
a O
core O
hippocampal-medial O
temporal O
lobe O
cortex O
( O
MTLC O
) O
network O
; O
and O
an O
extended O
hippocampalcortical O
network O
. O

As O
hippocampal O
function O
differs O
along O
its O
longitudinal O
axis O
, O
follow-up O
analyses O
examined O
anterior O
and O
posterior O
networks O
separately O
. O

To O
explore O
effects O
of O
resting O
network O
function O
on O
behavior O
, O
we O
tested O
associations O
between O
modularity O
and O
relational O
memory O
ability O
. O

Age O
, O
sex O
, O
handedness O
, O
and O
parental O
education O
were O
similar O
between O
groups O
. O

Results O
Network O
modularity O
was O
lower O
in O
schizophrenia O
patients O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
posterior O
hippocampal O
network O
. O

Schizophrenia O
patients O
also O
showed O
markedly O
lower O
relational O
memory O
ability O
compared O
to O
control O
subjects O
. O

We O
found O
a O
distinct O
brain-behavior O
relationship O
in O
schizophrenia O
that O
differed O
from O
control O
subjects O
by O
network O
and O
anterior/posterior O
division—while O
relational O
memory O
in O
control O
subjects O
was O
associated O
with O
anterior O
hippocampal-cortical O
modularity O
, O
schizophrenia O
patients O
showed O
an O
association O
with O
posterior O
hippocampal-MTLC O
network O
modularity O
. O

Conclusions O
Our O
findings O
support O
a O
model O
of O
abnormal O
resting-state O
cortico-hippocampal O
network O
coherence O
in O
schizophrenia O
, O
which O
may O
contribute O
to O
