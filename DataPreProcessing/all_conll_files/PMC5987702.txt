we O

we O

The O

By O

we O

the O

We O
hypothesized O

such O

in O

A O
second O
set O
of O
analyses O
examined O
whether O
DLPFC O

FHR O

and O
social O

on O
the O

We O
refer O

these O

“ O

” O
These O

included O

their O

By O
“ O
previous-day O

” O
we O
mean O
the O
maximum O

experienced O
on O
the O
day O
before O
dependent O

These O
analyses O
let O
us O
( O

) O
examine O
whether O
social O
conflict O
impacted O
participants O
even O
the O
day O
after O
a O
conflict O
and O
( O

) O
establish O
whether O
social O
conflict O
temporally O

changes O

We O
again O
hypothesized O
three-way O
interactions O
such O
that O
weak O
DLPFC O

and O
FHR O
status O
would O
be O
specifically O
associated O
with O
exacerbated O
mood O
and O
symptom O

on O
days O
following O
distressing O
social O
conflicts O

For O
both O
same-day O
and O
following-day O
analyses O
, O
each O
dependent O
variable O
( O
i.e. O
, O
negative O

) O
was O
modeled O
at O
the O
daily O

in O
a O

mixed-effects O
model O

Fixed-effect O
predictors O

included O

( O

, O
and O
the O

these O
three O

. O

Note O
that O
each O
participant O

daily O
conflict O

and O
overall O
neural O

were O
input O

These O

Models O
controlled O
for O
diary O

the O
previous O

level O
of O
each O
dependent O
variable O
. O

Controlling O
for O
the O
previous-day O
rating O
of O
dependent O
variables O
effectively O
means O
we O
modeled O
the O
change O
in O
the O
dependent O
variable O
from O
the O
previous O
day O
. O

We O
“ O
nested O
” O
days O
within O
participants O
by O
modeling O
participants O
as O
a O
random O

Diary O
day O
was O
allowed O
to O
have O
a O
random O
slope O
across O
participants O
. O

All O
continuous O
predictors O
were O
centered O
. O

We O
unpacked O
significant O
interactions O
between O
conflict O
distress O
and O
DLPFC O
activity O
using O
simple O
slopes O
analyses O
. O

These O
analyses O
dissect O
interactions O
and O
uncover O
which O
combinations O
of O
group O

, O
DLPFC O
activity O
, O
and O
conflict O
distress O
were O
associated O
with O
outcomes O
. O

These O
analyses O
specifically O
tested O
whether O
DLPFC O

was O
associated O
with O
mood O

levels O
within O
both O
FHR O
and O
non-FHR O
groups O
on O
days O
with O
high O
or O
low O
conflict O

Such O
piecewise O
analyses O
clarify O
which O
group O
and O
level O
of O
conflict O
distress O
drove O
interactions O
, O
thereby O
testing O
whether O
interactions O
were O
due O
to O
the O
hypothesized O

of O

For O
each O

simple O

We O
tested O
the O

using O
the O

Correction O
for O
multiple O

Although O
mixed-effect O
model O

were O
planned O
a O

, O
these O
analyses O
involved O
a O
large O
number O
of O

Hence O
, O
we O
implemented O
the O
method O
to O
facilitate O
interpretation O
of O
which O
results O
survived O
correction O
for O
multiple O
comparisons O
. O

Each O
predictor O
across O
all O
8 O

was O
considered O
a O

We O
report O

Follow-up O
control O

We O
conducted O
a O

To O
test O
whether O
primary O

even O
after O
controlling O
for O

we O
added O
these O

simultaneous O

in O
a O

We O
report O

Note O
that O
these O

included O
only O
a O

because O

Demonstrating O
that O

increases O
confidence O

the O
