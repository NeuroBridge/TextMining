A O
few O
studies O
have O
shown O
altered O
distribution O
of O
connectivity O
within O
and O
between O
functional O
modules O
in O
SCZ O
patients O
, O
an O
indication O

. O

However O
, O
no O
major O
alterations O
of O

have O
been O
reported O
in O
patients O
, O
and O
unambiguous O
identification O
of O
the O

remains O
elusive O
. O

Recently O
, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
current O
modularity O
analysis O
methods O
suffer O
from O
a O
fundamental O
and O
severe O
resolution O
limit O
, O
as O
they O
fail O
to O
detect O
features O
that O
are O
smaller O
than O
a O
scale O
determined O
by O
the O
size O
of O
the O
entire O

. O

This O
resolution O
limit O
is O
likely O
to O
have O
hampered O
the O
ability O
to O
resolve O
differences O
between O
patients O
and O

in O

. O

Here O
, O
we O
apply O
Surprise O
, O
a O
novel O
resolution O
limit-free O
approach O
, O
to O
study O
the O
modular O
organization O
of O

networks O
in O
a O
large O
cohort O
of O
SCZ O
patients O
and O
in O
matched O
healthy O
controls O
. O

Leveraging O
these O
important O
methodological O
advances O
we O
find O
new O
evidence O
of O
substantial O
fragmentation O
and O
reorganization O
involving O
primary O
sensory O
, O
auditory O
and O
visual O
areas O
in O

. O

Conversely O
, O
frontal O

areas O
, O

appear O
to O
be O
largely O
unaffected O
, O
with O
changes O
selectively O
involving O
language O
and O

areas O
. O

Our O
findings O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
cognitive O

in O

may O
involve O
deficits O
occurring O
already O
at O
