Abstract O
Adolescents O
are O
notorious O
for O
engaging O
in O
risky O
, O
reward-motivated O
behavior O
, O
and O
this O
behavior O
occurs O
most O
often O
in O
response O
to O
social O
reward O
, O
typically O
in O
the O
form O
of O
peer O
contexts O
involving O
intense O
positive O
affect O
. O

A O
combination O
of O
greater O
neural O
and O
behavioral O
sensitivity O
to O
peer O
positive O
affect O
may O
characterize O
adolescents O
who O
are O
especially O
likely O
to O
engage O
in O
risky O
behaviors O
. O

To O
test O
this O
hypothesis O
, O
we O
examined O
50 O
adolescents O
’ O
reciprocal O
positive O
affect O
and O
neural O
response O
to O
a O
personally O
relevant O
, O
ecologically O
valid O
pleasant O
stimulus O
: O
positive O
affect O
expressed O
by O
their O
best O
friend O
during O
a O
conversation O
about O
past O
and O
future O
rewarding O
mutual O
experiences O
. O

were O
typically O
developing O
community O
adolescents O
( O
age O
14–18 O

, O
48.6 O
% O

, O
and O
risky O
behavior O
was O
defined O
as O
a O
factor O
including O
domains O
such O
as O
substance O
use O
, O
sexual O
behavior O
and O
suicidality O
. O

Adolescents O
who O
engaged O
in O
more O
real-life O
risk-taking O
behavior O
exhibited O
either O
a O
combination O
of O
high O
reciprocal O
positive O
affect O
behavior O
and O
high O
response O
in O
the O
left O
ventrolateral O
prefrontal O
cortex—a O
region O
associated O
with O
impulsive O
sensation-seeking—or O
the O
opposite O
combination O
. O

Behavioral O
and O
neural O
sensitivity O
to O
peer O
influence O
could O
combine O
to O
contribute O
to O
pathways O
from O
