Schizophrenia O
Background O
Childhood-onset O
schizophrenia O
( O
COS O
) O
is O
a O
rare O
, O
severe O
form O
of O
the O
adult-onset O
disorder O
( O
AOS O
) O
. O

Our O
previous O
resting-state O
fMRI O
study O
identified O
attenuated O
functional O
connectivity O
in O
COS O
compared O
with O
controls O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
ask O
whether O
COS O
and O
AOS O
patients O
and O
their O
siblings O
exhibit O
similar O
abnormalities O
of O
functional O
connectivity O
. O

Methods O
A O
whole-brain O
, O
data-driven O
approach O
was O
used O
to O
assess O
resting-state O
functional O
connectivity O
differences O
in O
COS O
( O
patients/siblings/controls O
, O
n O
: O
26/28/33 O
) O
and O
AOS O
( O
n O
: O
19/28/30 O
) O
. O

There O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
age O
, O
sex O
, O
or O
head O
motion O
across O
groups O
in O
each O
dataset O
and O
as O
designed O
, O
the O
COS O
dataset O
has O
a O
significantly O
lower O
age O
than O
the O
AOS O
. O

Results O
Both O
COS O
and O
AOS O
patients O
showed O
decreased O
functional O
connectivity O
relative O
to O
controls O
among O
a O
wide O
set O
of O
brain O
regions O
( O
P O
< O
0.05 O
, O
corrected O
) O
, O
but O
their O
siblings O
did O
not O
. O

Decreased O
connectivity O
in O
COS O
and O
AOS O
patients O
showed O
no O
amplitude O
differences O
and O
was O
not O
modulated O
by O
age-at-onset O
or O
medication O
doses O
. O

Cluster O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
these O
regions O
fell O
into O
two O
large-scale O
networks O
: O
one O
sensorimotor O
network O
and O
one O
centered O
on O
default-mode O
network O
regions O
, O
but O
including O
higher-order O
cognitive O
areas O
only O
in O
COS O
. O

Decreased O
connectivity O
between O
these O
two O
networks O
was O
notable O
( O
P O
< O
0.05 O
, O
corrected O
) O
for O
both O
patient O
groups O
. O

Conclusions O
A O
shared O
pattern O
of O
attenuated O
functional O
connectivity O
was O
found O
in O
COS O
and O
AOS O
, O
supporting O
the O
continuity O
of O
childhood-onset O
and O
adult-onset O
schizophrenia O
. O

Connections O
were O
altered O
between O
sensorimotor O
areas O
and O
default-mode O
areas O
in O
both O
COS O
and O
AOS O
, O
suggesting O
potential O
abnormalities O
in O
processes O
of O
self-monitoring O
and O
sensory O
prediction O
. O

The O
absence O
of O
substantial O
dysconnectivity O
in O
siblings O
indicates O
that O
attenuation O
is O
state-related O
. O
