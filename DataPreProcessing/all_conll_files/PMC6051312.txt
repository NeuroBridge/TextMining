Here O
, O
we O
used O
an O

to O
activate O
the O

20 O
CHR O

performed O
a O
second-order O

This O
was O
preceded O
and O
followed O
by O
the O
paradigm O
under O

In O
addition O
, O
all O
participants O
underwent O
structured O
clinical O
interviews O
to O
confirm O
a O

syndrome O
and O
assess O
symptom O

. O

The O
rate O
of O
learning O
did O
not O
differ O
between O
groups O
. O

However O
, O
the O
CHR O
group O
consistently O
performed O
more O
poorly O
under O

conditions O
, O
and O
exhibited O
a O
higher O

Further O
, O
learning O
rate O
in O
the O
CHR O
group O
was O
significantly O
associated O
with O
symptom O

. O

Both O
groups O
showed O
activation O
in O
regions O
of O
the O
CTCC O

During O
early O

, O
the O
CHR O
group O
exhibited O
greater O
engagement O
of O

, O
suggesting O
that O
they O
were O
less O

During O

there O
were O
qualitative O

Second-order O
rule O
learning O
task O
In O
order O
to O
assess O
non-motor O
rule O
learning O
while O
targeting O
the O
CTCC O
, O
we O
used O
a O
second-order O
rule O
learning O
task O
developed O
by O
. O

This O
task O
was O
designed O
to O
dissociate O
the O
motoric O
response O
to O
a O
visual O
stimulus O
from O
the O
rule-learning O
itself O
. O

To O
do O
so O
, O
we O
used O
an O
event-related O
imaging O
design O
( O
described O
in O
more O
detail O
below O
) O
wherein O
we O
were O
able O
to O
dissociate O
the O
activation O
associated O
with O
the O
rule O
itself O
, O
from O
that O
associated O
with O
the O
preparation O
and O
execution O
of O
the O
motor O
response O
. O

Because O
we O
were O
particularly O
interested O
in O
cerebellar O
activation O
during O
learning O
in O
a O
non-motor O
paradigm O
in O
CHR O
individuals O
, O
we O
adapted O
the O
second-order O
rule O
learning O
condition O
to O
investigate O
group O
differences O
in O
cerebellar O
activation O
during O
learning O
. O

In O
order O
to O
focus O
on O
learning O
of O
the O
associations O
over O
time O
, O
we O
adapted O
the O
task O
such O
that O
participants O
completed O
6 O
blocks O
of O
learning O
, O
whereas O
, O
also O
included O
several O
additional O
conditions O
, O
including O
a O
first-order O
rule O
. O

Just O
learning O
blocks O
allow O
for O
the O
collection O
of O
enough O
data O
to O
look O
at O
early O
versus O
late O
learning O
, O
and O
to O
asses O
group O
differences O
in O
both O
behavior O
and O
brain O
activation O
during O
these O
phases O
. O

Further O
, O
we O
modified O
this O
task O
slightly O
in O
terms O
of O
timing O
to O
work O
with O
multi-band O
imaging O
, O
but O
were O
careful O
to O
keep O
task O
timing O
as O
close O
to O
the O
original O
paradigm O
as O
possible O
( O
timing O
details O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Participants O
were O
instructed O
to O
match O
an O
abstract O
shape O
with O
a O
color O
. O

There O
were O
four O
colors O
and O
four O
shapes O
. O

Initial O
responses O
were O
made O
by O
guessing O
. O

Participants O
received O
feedback O
about O
their O
performance O
after O
making O
their O
responses O
. O

During O
the O
task O
, O
participants O
were O
presented O
with O
an O
abstract O
shape O
in O
green O
, O
on O
a O
grey O

for O
460 O

indicative O
of O
the O

This O
was O
both O
preceded O
and O
followed O
by O
a O
variable O

After O
the O
delay O
, O
participants O
were O
presented O
with O
the O
word O
“ O
Go O

” O
written O
in O
red O
on O
a O
grey O

for O
230 O
ms O
, O
and O
were O
instructed O
to O
make O
a O
button-press O
response O
following O
the O
cue O
. O

Next O
, O
participants O
saw O
four O
hourglass O

, O
each O
one O
a O
different O
color O
( O
black O
, O
blue O

From O
left O

, O
the O
hourglass O

. O

Finally O
, O
after O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
response O
cue O
, O
participants O
were O
presented O
with O
feedback O
. O

They O
saw O
either O
a O
green O
circle O
( O
correct O

) O
, O
red O
circle O
( O
incorrect O

) O
, O
or O
the O
word O
“ O

presented O
for O
230 O

did O
not O
make O

during O
the O
920 O
ms O
“ O

, O
they O
received O
the O
“ O

Timing O
of O
the O
“ O

” O
screen O
, O
response O
cue O
, O
and O
feedback O
was O
variable O
over O
a O
period O
of O
3680 O
ms. O
All O
participants O
completed O
6 O
blocks O
of O
the O
task O
, O
each O
with O
25 O

. O

The O
variable O
periods O
during O
both O
the O
initial O
“ O
instruction O

” O
period O
and O
later O
during O
the O
“ O

period O
were O
implemented O
so O
as O
to O
allow O
for O
jittering O
between O
events O
such O
that O
fMRI O
data O
could O
be O
analyzed O
in O
an O
event-related O
manner O
. O

Jittering O
during O
both O
phases O
of O
the O
task O
was O
done O
over O
a O
period O
of O
3680 O
ms O
( O
equivalent O
to O
8 O
TRs O
) O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
because O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
the O
second-order O
non-motor O
rule O
, O
this O
allowed O
us O
to O
focus O
on O
an O
investigation O
of O
activation O
during O
the O
“ O
instruction O

” O
when O
processing O

and O
the O

the O
“ O

” O
, O
where O
processing O
is O
related O
to O

. O

While O
we O
can O
not O
have O
a O
task O
without O
an O
overt O
motor O

, O
we O
were O
however O
able O
to O
parse O
the O

associated O
with O
different O
components O
of O
the O
task O
, O
with O
the O
imaging O
design O
, O
consistent O
with O
prior O
work O
using O
this O
task O

To O
assess O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
participants O
learned O
the O
task O
, O
participants O
also O
completed O
the O
task O
under O
dual-task O
conditions O
both O
before O
and O
after O
the O
learning O
blocks O
This O
condition O
served O
as O
a O
manipulation O
check O
to O
evaluate O

, O
and O
as O
such O
was O
not O
a O
condition O
of O
interest O
with O
respect O
to O
brain O
activity O
. O

During O
the O
dual-task O
condition O
, O
all O
aspects O
of O
the O
task O
remained O
the O
same O
; O
however O
, O
participants O
were O
asked O
to O
count O
backwards O
by O
7 O
, O
starting O
from O
500 O
. O

They O
were O
asked O
to O
count O
approximately O
once O
per O

. O

We O
did O
not O
record O

, O
though O
we O
did O
encourage O

continue O
counting O
throughout O
the O
task O
in O
any O
instances O

As O
we O
were O

, O
all O

was O
conducted O
in O
the O

However O
, O
we O
did O
not O
run O
the O

during O
the O
pre- O

post-learning O
dual-task O

. O

This O
allowed O
the O
participant O
to O
speak O
without O
any O

and O
enabled O
us O
to O
hear O
their O

without O
the O
background O

of O
the O

. O

We O
quantified O
accuracy O

Accuracy O
was O
reported O
as O
the O

was O
computed O
on O
a O

We O
also O
looked O
at O
both O
of O
these O

during O
the O

Finally O
, O
we O

cerebellar O
engagement O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
change O
during O
the O
early O
phases O
of O
learning O
. O

To O
determine O
the O
early O
learning O
phase O
, O
we O
followed O
the O
procedures O
outlined O
by O
Anguera O
and O
colleagues O
. O

We O
collapsed O
across O
groups O
and O
calculated O
the O
slope O
for O
consecutive O
blocks O
of O
increasing O
length O
( O
e.g. O
, O
first O
two O
blocks O
, O
first O
three O
blocks O
) O
, O
and O
tested O
which O
combination O
resulted O
in O
a O
significant O
drop O
in O
slope O
. O

We O
limited O
our O
analyses O
to O
the O
first O
four O
blocks O
, O
as O
upon O
visual O
inspection O
, O
participants O
in O
both O
groups O
began O
to O
reach O
asymptotic O
performance O
after O
block O
4 O
. O

We O
then O
compared O
the O
early O
learning O
rate O
between O
the O
two O
groups O
. O

While O
the O
dual-task O
condition O
is O
critical O
for O
testing O
the O
learning O
manipulation O
, O
it O
also O
allows O
us O
to O
investigate O
the O
dual-task O
cost O
, O
which O
can O
provide O
further O
insight O
into O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
individuals O
learned O
and O
automatized O
a O
task O
. O

Thus O
, O
we O
investigated O
group O
differences O
in O
the O
dual-task O
cost O
between O
the O
CHR O
and O
control O
groups O
after O
learning O
. O

Dual-task O
cost O
was O
operationalized O
as O
the O
difference O
in O
accuracy O
between O
the O
last O
block O
of O
the O
learning O
task O
and O
the O
dual-task O
condition O
that O
immediately O
followed O
( O
block O
6 O
accuracy O
– O
dual-task O
accuracy O
) O
. O

Positive O
values O
indicate O
better O
performance O
under O
the O
single O
task O
conditions O
, O
and O
the O
higher O
the O
value O
, O
the O
greater O
cost O
of O
performing O
under O
dual-task O
conditions O
. O

Finally O
, O
as O
we O
were O
interested O
in O
whether O
or O
not O
non-motor O
learning O
is O
related O
to O
symptom O
severity O
in O
CHR O
individuals O
, O
we O
also O
investigated O
correlations O
between O
early O
learning O
slope O
, O
and O
severity O
of O
positive O
, O
negative O
, O
and O
disorganized O
symptoms O
in O
the O
CHR O
group O
