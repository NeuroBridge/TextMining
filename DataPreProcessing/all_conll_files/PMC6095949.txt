are O

Recent O
work O
suggests O
that O
the O
ability O
to O
extract O
social O
information O
from O
bodily O
cues O
is O
reduced O
in O
patients O
. O

However O
, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
neurobiological O
mechanisms O
underlying O
this O
deficit O
. O

In O
the O
current O
study O
, O
20 O
schizophrenia O
patients O
and O
16 O
controls O
completed O
two O
tasks O
using O
point-light O
animations O
during O
fMRI O
: O
a O
basic O
biological O
motion O
task O
and O
an O
emotion O
in O
biological O
motion O
task O
. O

The O
basic O
biological O
motion O
task O
was O
used O
to O
localize O
activity O
in O
posterior O
superior O
temporal O
sulcus O
( O
pSTS O
) O
, O
a O
critical O
region O
for O
biological O
motion O
perception O
. O

During O
the O
emotion O
in O
biological O
motion O
task O
, O
participants O
viewed O
brief O
videos O
depicting O
happiness O
, O
fear O
, O
anger O
, O
or O
neutral O
emotions O
and O
were O
asked O
to O
decide O
which O
emotion O
was O
portrayed O
. O

Activity O
in O
pSTS O
and O
amygdala O
was O
interrogated O
during O
this O
task O
. O

Results O
indicated O
that O
patients O
showed O
overall O
reduced O
activation O
compared O
to O
controls O
in O
pSTS O
and O
at O
a O
trend O
level O
in O
amygdala O
across O
emotions O
, O
despite O
similar O
task O
performance O
. O

Further O
, O
a O
functional O
connectivity O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
controls O
, O
but O
not O
patients O
, O
showed O
significant O
positive O
connectivity O
between O
pSTS O
and O
left O
frontal O
regions O
as O
well O
as O
bilateral O
angular O
gyrus O
during O
the O
emotion O
in O
biological O
motion O
task O
. O

These O
findings O
indicate O
that O
schizophrenia O
patients O
show O
aberrant O
neural O
activity O
and O
functional O
connectivity O
when O
extracting O
complex O
social O
information O
from O

, O
which O
may O
contribute O
