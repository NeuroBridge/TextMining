summary O
Schizophrenia O
patients O
display O
deficits O
in O
the O
appropriate O
attribution O
of O
meaningfulness O
to O
stimuli O
; O
such O
as O
aberrantly O
increased O
processing O
of O

and O
insufficient O
processing O
of O

information O
. O

We O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
subjective O
nature O
of O
relevance O
detection O
and O
its O
deficit O
in O
schizophrenia O
and O
developed O
an O
implicit O
learning O
paradigm O
that O
allowed O
for O
parallel O
learning O
from O
relevant O
and O
irrelevant O
information O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
idea O
that O
subjective O
relevance O
might O
be O
captured O
by O
Bayesian O
precision O
we O
set O
up O
different O
computational O
models O
of O
how O
subjective O
relevance O
guides O
learning O
and O
behavioral O
adaptation O
. O

We O
found O
that O
subjects O
use O
Bayesian O
precision O
to O
estimate O
stimulus O
relevance O
in O
order O
to O
integrate O
multidimensional O
information O
and O
adapt O
more O
to O
the O
subjectively O
relevant O
stimuli O
. O

This O
relevance O
weighted O
adaptation O
correlated O
with O
brain O
activation O
within O
the O
salience O
network O
. O

Further O
, O
schizophrenia O
patients O
displayed O
an O
increased O
aberrant O
tendency O
to O
irrelevant O
events O
which O
related O
to O
decreased O
striatal O
coding O
of O
the O

To O
conclude O
, O
our O
findings O
demonstrate O
how O
individual O
beliefs O
about O
relevance O
can O
be O
inferred O
from O
computational O
models O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
suggest O
that O
aberrant O
salience O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
reflects O
an O
idiosyncratic O
bias O

Implicit O
salience O
paradigm O
( O
ISP O
) O
This O
paradigm O
was O
explicitly O
instructed O
like O
a O
target-detection O
task O
though O
implicitly O
being O
a O
learning O
paradigm O
where O
features O
of O
neutral O
stimuli O
predicted O
certain O
outcomes O
. O

It O
consisted O
of O
160 O
trials O
where O
subjects O
were O
told O
to O
discriminate O
the O
outcomes O
( O
10 O
Eurocent O
coin O
or O
blue O
circle O
) O
of O
each O
trial O
. O

Therefore O
, O
their O
only O
task O
was O
to O
press O
a O
respective O
button O
when O
they O
saw O
a O
coin O
, O
versus O
another O
button O
when O
they O
saw O
the O
blue O

. O

Subjects O
were O
told O
that O
they O
would O
receive O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
they O
had O
seen O
during O
the O
task O
irrespective O
of O
whether O
they O
had O
pressed O
a O

or O
not O
, O
though O
they O
were O
encouraged O
by O
the O
experimenters O
not O
to O
miss O
too O
many O
trials O
because O
this O
would O
impede O
the O
analysis O
. O

The O
outcomes O
were O
preceded O
by O
conditioned O
stimuli O
that O
differed O
in O
color O
and O

: O
gray O
or O
colorful O
squares O
or O
triangles O
( O
see O
Fig O

) O
. O

During O
the O
instructions O
, O
subjects O
were O
told O
not O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
these O
stimuli O
preceding O
the O
outcomes O
. O

However O
, O
prior O
to O

, O
participants O
were O
primed O
with O
the O

while O
they O
were O
asked O
to O
name O
the O
color O
and O
the O

of O
each O
of O
the O
four O
conditioned O

. O

Then O
, O
they O
practiced O
the O

for O
10 O
trials O
. O

In O
this O
practice O
session O
, O
all O
outcomes O
were O
preceded O
by O
a O
stimulus O
that O
was O
not O
presented O
during O
the O
main O
experiment O
in O
the O
scanner O
. O

In O
the O
main O
experiment O
, O
the O
conditioned O
stimuli O
predicted O
the O
outcome O
types O
in O
a O
probabilistic O
manner O
that O
reversed O
during O
the O
task O
. O

Importantly O
, O
only O
one O
stimulus O
feature O
reliably O
predicted O
the O
outcome O
( O
eg O
, O
shape O
) O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
80 O
% O
of O
all O

were O
followed O
by O
the O
coin O
( O
20 O

) O
, O
and O
80 O
% O
of O
all O
squares O
were O
followed O
by O
the O
blue O
circle O
( O
20 O
% O
coin O
) O
. O

Whether O
the O
square O
or O
the O
triangle O
predicted O
the O
coin O
reversed O
every O
20 O
trials O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
color O
of O
the O
stimuli O
was O
irrelevant O
in O
predicting O
the O
outcome O
; O
colorful O
and O
gray O
stimuli O
were O
equally O
followed O
by O
coins O
and O
circles O
( O
50 O
% O
each O
) O
. O

After O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
experiment O
this O
was O
reversed O
, O
and O
then O
the O
formerly O
irrelevant O
feature O
( O
here O
: O

) O
predicted O
the O
outcome O
, O
whereas O
the O
other O
feature O
turned O
irrelevant O
( O

. O

The O

By O
that O

In O
keeping O
with O
our O
initial O

, O
a O

should O
be O

In O

We O

In O

Thereby O

we O

We O
did O
not O
model O
relevant O
and O
irrelevant O
conditions O
separately O
because O
of O
two O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
the O
generative O
model O
was O
supposed O
to O
capture O
the O
subjects O
’ O
learning O
experience O
and O
they O
were O
not O
instructed O
about O
the O
task O
structure O
having O
relevant O
and O
irrelevant O
conditions O
. O

Instead O
they O
were O
only O
primed O
with O
the O
distinction O
by O
feature O
, O
color O
and O
shape O
, O
in O
the O
practice O
session O
. O

Second O
, O
after O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
experiment O
we O
switched O
the O
relevant O
dimension O
( O
e.g O
. O

shape O
to O
color O
) O
. O

Hence O
, O
modeling O
separately O
for O
relevance O
versus O
irrelevance O
would O
have O
introduced O
external O
information O
on O
the O
task O
structure O
that O
was O
not O
accessible O
to O
subjects O
and O
thus O
not O
generative O
. O

The O
resulting O
learning O
trajectories O
for O
shape O
and O
color O
were O
transformed O
into O
trial-by-trial O
predictors O
of O

The O

offers O
a O

framework O
for O

multiple O

Crucially O
, O
the O

The O

the O

focused O

A O
novel O
definition O
of O
relevance O
: O
First-level O
precision O
Since O
the O
core O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
the O
dissociation O
between O
learning O
about O
relevant O
versus O
irrelevant O
cue O
features O
, O
the O
term O
relevance O
needs O
to O
be O
defined O
formally O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
ISP O
, O
a O
cue O
feature O
should O
be O
perceived O
as O
more O
relevant O
the O
more O
precisely O
it O
is O
believed O
to O
predict O
the O
outcome O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
if O
the O
belief O
of O
an O
association O
is O
0.5 O
it O
should O
be O
perceived O
as O
irrelevant O
for O
outcome O
prediction O
( O
because O
in O
this O
case O
reward O
and O
circle O
will O
occur O
with O
the O
same O
probability O
and O
can O
not O
be O
reliably O
predicted O
) O
. O

In O
the O
HGF O
framework O
, O
this O
interpretation O
of O
relevance O
is O
reflected O
in O
the O
estimated O
precision O
of O
prediction O
on O
the O
first O
level O
( O
see O

) O
. O

It O
is O
a O
function O
only O
of O
the O
first-level O

which O
ranges O
between O

a O
minimum O
of O
4 O
for O
and O
increases O
symmetrically O
to O

as O
approaches O

or O

This O

the O

as O
a O

one O
of O
the O

on O
a O
trial-by-trial O
basis O
. O

Both O
aspects O
were O
formalized O
in O
the O
following O
four O
response O
models O
. O

The O
baseline O
response O
model O
( O
see O
Eq O
4 O
) O
postulates O
that O
trial-by-trial O
reaction O
times O
are O
a O
linear O
function O
of O
the O
mean O
of O
the O
prediction O
errors O
of O
both O
features O
( O
4.1.1 O
) O
, O
a O
constant O
bias O
towards O
one O
feature O
manifestation O
( O
eg O
, O
triangles O
over O
squares O
) O
and O
the O
outcome O
( O
eg O
, O
slower O
for O
circles O
than O
for O
coin O
trials O
; O
4.2.1 O
) O
. O

The O
four O
cue O
manifestation O
vectors O
m O
reflect O
whether O
the O
respective O
manifestations O
were O
displayed O
for O
every O
trial O
( O
eg O
, O
1 O
for O
triangles O
and O
0 O
for O
squares O
in O
mtriangle O
) O
. O

This O
response O
model O
was O
modified O
in O
three O
ways O
. O

In O
a O
first O
modification O
( O
4.1.2 O
) O
, O
the O
absolute O
prediction O
errors O
of O
each O
feature O
were O
weighted O
according O
to O
their O
respective O
relevance O
weight O
( O
rel O
; O
5 O
) O
. O

The O
latter O
is O
formalized O
as O
the O
relative O
amount O
of O
each O
feature O
’ O
s O
precision O
given O
the O
overall O
precisions O
of O
both O
features O
. O

In O
a O
second O
modification O
and O
in O
line O
with O
the O
aberrant O
salience O
effect O
, O
the O
constant O
bias O
was O
weighted O
according O
to O
its O
feature O
’ O
s O
irrelevance O
( O
irrel O
; O
see O
Eq O
4.2.2 O
) O
. O

The O
irrelevance O
weight O
of O
one O
feature O
was O
defined O
as O
the O
relevance O
weight O
of O
the O
opposing O
feature O
( O
see O
Eq O
5 O
) O
. O

From O
the O
four O
cue O
feature O
parameters O
( O
β2 O
, O
… O
, O
β5 O
) O
one O
composite O
parameter O
was O
calculated O
in O
two O
steps O
. O

First O
, O
the O
individual O
absolute O
differences O
between O
the O
β2 O
and O
β3 O
for O
irrelevance O
weighted O
manifestations O
within O
color O
( O
and O
between O
the O
β4 O
and O
β5 O
for O
shape O
manifestations O
) O
were O
calculated O
. O

Then O
, O
they O
were O
collapsed O
across O
color O
and O
shape O
to O
achieve O
one O
parameter O
βirrelevance O
capturing O
the O
bias O
towards O
one O
cue O
feature O
manifestation O
that O
increased O
with O
subjective O
irrelevance O
. O

Thus O
, O
we O
compared O
four O
different O
response O
models O
: O
the O
baseline O
model O
( O
Eq O
4 O
) O
, O
the O
baseline O
model O
with O
relevance O
weighted O
absolute O
prediction O
errors O
( O
Eq O
4 O
with O
modification O
term O
4.1.2 O
; O
RelPE O
) O
, O
the O
baseline O
model O
with O
only O
the O
irrelevance O
bias O
( O
Eq O
4 O
with O
modification O
term O
4.2.2 O
; O
IrrelBias O
) O
, O
and O
a O
full O
model O
with O
both O
modifications O
( O
