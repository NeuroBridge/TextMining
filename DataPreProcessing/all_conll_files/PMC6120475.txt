Abstract O
Relapse O
after O
initially O
successful O
treatment O
is O
a O
significant O
problem O
facing O
the O
treatment O
of O
opioid O
dependence O
. O

Evidence O
suggests O
craving O
elicited O
by O
re‐exposure O
to O
drug O
cues O
may O
precipitate O
relapse O
. O

Attempts O
to O
identify O
neural O
biomarkers O
of O
cue‐elicited O
craving O
have O
yielded O
inconsistent O
findings O
. O

We O
aimed O
to O
apply O
a O
novel O
continuous O
functional O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
technique O
to O
follow O
the O
minute‐to‐minute O
evolution O
of O
brain O
responses O
, O
which O
correlate O
with O
the O
waxing O
and O
waning O
of O
craving O
. O

Newly O
detoxified O
male O
opioid‐dependent O
patients O
and O
healthy O
control O
participants O
attended O
two O
separate O
, O
counterbalanced O
, O
functional O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
scanning O
sessions O
during O
which O
they O
viewed O
a O
10‐minute O
video O
( O
drug O
cue O
or O
neutral O
cue O
) O
followed O
by O
5 O
minutes O
of O
fixation O
. O

Participants O
rated O
the O
intensity O
of O
their O
craving O
throughout O
each O
session O
. O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
subcortical/ventral O
prefrontal O
cortex O
( O
PFC O
) O
regions O
and O
dorsal O
PFC O
regions O
would O
show O
different O
associations O
with O
craving O
reflecting O
their O
putative O
roles O
in O
appetitive O
processing O
versus O
cognitive O
control O
. O

Compared O
with O
controls O
, O
drug O
cue O
( O
minus O
neutral O
cue O
) O
video O
recruited O
the O
left O
amygdala O
and O
was O
temporally O
correlated O
with O
craving O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
dorsal O
anterior O
cingulate O
blood‐oxygen‐level‐dependent O
signal O
time O
course O
was O
higher O
than O
controls O
only O
during O
a O
period O
after O
cue O
exposure O
when O
craving O
levels O
were O
declining O
. O

Against O
expectations O
, O
neither O
the O
ventral O
striatum O
nor O
ventral O
PFC O
was O
significantly O
recruited O
by O
drug O
cue O
exposure O
. O

Findings O
suggest O
that O
the O
amygdala O
has O
a O
central O
role O
in O
craving O
, O
whereas O
the O
dorsal O
anterior O
cingulate O
may O
control O
craving O
in O
treatment‐seeking O
patients O
. O

Time O
course O
analysis O
yielded O
new O
insights O
into O
the O
neural O
substrates O
of O
craving O
that O
could O
objectively O
validate O
development O
of O
psychological O
and O
pharmacological O
approaches O
to O
sustained O
abstinence O
. O
