Methods O
Original O

in O
alcohol O
addiction O
and O
its O
neurobiological O

Findings O

Conclusions O
Neuroimaging O
research O
has O
uncovered O
neurobiological O
markers O
that O
appear O
to O
be O
linked O
to O
resilience O
and O
improved O
recovery O
capacities O
that O
are O
furthermore O
influenced O
by O
various O
factors O

as O
gender O
or O
genetics O

Consequently O
, O
future O
system-oriented O
approaches O
may O
help O
to O
establish O
a O
broad O
neuroscience-based O
research O
framework O
for O
