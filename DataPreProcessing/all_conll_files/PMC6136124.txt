The O
brain O
has O
a O
very O
specific O
structural O
substrate O
providing O
a O
foundation O
for O
functional O
information O
; O
however O
, O
most O
studies O
ignore O
the O
very O
interesting O
and O
complex O
relationships O
between O
brain O
structure O
and O
brain O
function O
. O

While O
a O
variety O
of O
approaches O
have O
been O
used O
to O
study O
how O
brain O
structure O
informs O
function O
, O
the O
study O
of O
such O
relationships O
in O
living O
humans O
in O
most O
cases O
is O
limited O
to O
noninvasive O
approaches O
at O
the O
macroscopic O
scale O
. O

The O
use O
of O
data-driven O
approaches O
to O
link O
structure O
and O
function O
provides O
a O
tool O
which O
is O
especially O
important O
at O
the O
macroscopic O
scale O
at O
which O
we O
can O
study O
the O
human O
brain O
. O

This O
paper O
reviews O
data-driven O
approaches O
, O
with O
a O
focus O
on O
independent O
component O
analysis O
approaches O
, O
which O
leverage O
higher O
order O
statistics O
to O
link O
together O
macroscopic O
structural O
and O
functional O
MRI O
data O
. O

Such O
approaches O
provide O
the O
benefit O
of O
allowing O
us O
to O
identify O
links O
which O
do O
not O
necessarily O
correspond O
spatially O
( O
eg O
, O
structural O
changes O
in O
one O
region O
related O
to O
functional O
changes O
in O
other O
regions O
) O
. O

They O
also O
provide O
a O
“ O
network O
level O
” O
perspective O
on O
the O
data O
, O
by O
enabling O
us O
to O
identify O
sets O
of O
brain O
regions O
that O
covary O
together O
. O

This O
also O
opens O
up O
the O
ability O
to O
evaluate O
both O
within O
and O
between O
network O
relationships O
. O

A O
variety O
of O
examples O
are O
presented O
, O
including O
several O
showing O
the O
potential O
of O
such O
approaches O
to O
inform O
us O
about O
mental O
illness O
, O
particularly O
about O
schizophrenia O
