Brain O

The O

Results O

that O

In O
the O

the O

However O
, O
the O

no O

still O

when O

Interestingly O
, O
we O
also O
found O

only O

Firstly O

Then O

MI O

The O
main O
advantage O

that O
it O

both O

The O

Briefly O
, O
given O
two O

, O
the O

For O
a O
fair O

, O
here O
we O
computed O
the O

where O

are O
the O

is O
defined O
as O
∑xPX O

The O

Here O
, O
the O

are O

increase O
the O

as O
to O
enhance O
the O
stationarity O
and O
consistency O
of O
the O
MI O
computation O
. O

MI O
between O
all O

of O

was O
computed O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
24 O

24 O
matrix O
( O

For O
each O

, O
the O
MI O
