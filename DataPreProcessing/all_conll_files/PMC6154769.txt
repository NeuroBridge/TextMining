Background O
Insight O
is O
impaired O
in O
the O
majority O
of O
schizophrenia O
patients O
. O

The O
exact O
neural O
correlates O
of O
impaired O
insight O
remain O
unclear O
. O

We O
assume O
that O
the O
ability O
to O
regulate O
emotions O
contributes O
to O
having O
good O
clinical O
insight O
, O
as O
patients O
should O
be O
able O
to O
regulate O
their O
emotional O
state O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
can O
adapt O
adequately O
in O
order O
to O
cope O
with O
impaired O
functioning O
and O
negative O
stigma O
associated O
with O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
schizophrenia O
. O

Numerous O
studies O
have O
shown O
emotional O
dysregulation O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

We O
investigated O
the O
association O
between O
insight O
and O
brain O
activation O
and O
connectivity O
during O
emotion O
regulation O
. O

Methods O
Brain O
activation O
during O
emotion O
regulation O
was O
measured O
with O
functional O
MRI O
in O
30 O
individuals O
with O
schizophrenia O
. O

Two O
emotion O
regulation O
strategies O
were O
examined O
: O
cognitive O
reappraisal O
and O
expressive O
suppression O
. O

Clinical O
insight O
was O
measured O
with O
the O
Schedule O

the O
Assessment O

Insight O
– O
Expanded O
, O
and O
cognitive O
insight O
was O
measured O
with O
the O

Scale O
. O

Whole O

random O

multiple O

analyses O
were O
conducted O
to O
assess O
the O
relation O
between O
brain O
activation O
during O
emotion O
regulation O
and O
insight O
. O

Generalized O
psychophysiological O
interaction O
( O
gPPI O
) O
was O
used O
to O
investigate O
the O
relation O
between O
task-related O

and O

. O

Results O
No O
significant O
associations O
were O
found O
between O
insight O
and O
neural O
correlates O
of O
cognitive O
reappraisal O
. O

For O
clinical O
insight O
and O
suppression O
, O
significant O
positive O
associations O
were O
found O
between O
symptom O

and O
activation O
in O
the O
left O
striatum O

Furthermore O
, O
reduced O

was O
associated O
with O
more O

For O
cognitive O

, O
significant O
positive O

were O
found O
between O
self-reflectiveness O
and O
activation O
in O
pre- O

Conclusions O
Our O
results O
suggest O
an O
association O
between O
the O
capacity O
to O
relabel O
symptoms O
and O
activation O
of O
brain O
systems O
involved O
in O
cognitive-emotional O
control O
and O
visual O
processing O
of O
negative O
stimuli O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
poorer O
self-reflectiveness O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
brain O
systems O

Highlights O
We O
examined O
the O
association O

The O

based O
on O
the O

framework O
of O

Before O

all O

make O
sure O
they O
completely O
understood O
the O

what O

They O
told O
the O

Only O

the O

‘ O

asking O

to O
look O

After O
that O
, O
instructions O
were O
presented O
on O
the O

the O

how O
to O

( O

Instructions O
were O

, O
but O
translated O

During O
‘ O
attend O
’ O
the O
participants O
were O
asked O
to O
just O
look O

, O
while O
the O

were O
asked O

regulate O
their O

during O
‘ O

, O
‘ O

and O
‘ O

During O
‘ O
reappraisal O
’ O
the O
participant O
was O
instructed O
to O
reinterpret O
the O
picture O
in O
a O
way O
that O
decreases O
negative O
feelings O
. O

The O
instructions O
for O
‘ O
suppression O
’ O
asked O
the O
participant O
to O
suppress O
the O
expressive O
emotional O
reaction O
provoked O
by O
the O
picture O
. O

They O
were O
instructed O
that O
no O
one O
should O
be O
able O
to O
read O
their O
emotions O
from O
their O
face O
. O

The O
‘ O
increase O
’ O
condition O
entailed O
the O
opposite O
of O
the O
‘ O
reappraise O
’ O
condition O
, O
so O
participants O
had O
to O
increase O
the O
negative O
emotions O
caused O
by O
the O
stimulus O
. O

Stimuli O
were O
shown O
for O
6 O

After O
the O
emotion O

part O
of O
this O

, O
the O
participants O
were O
asked O
to O
let O
their O
emotions O
linger O
while O
a O
black O
screen O
was O
shown O
to O
them O
( O
Lingering O

. O

Consequently O
, O

had O
to O
rate O
how O

they O
felt O

( O

At O

the O

‘ O

was O
presented O
and O
participants O
could O
relax O
for O
4 O

( O

. O

The O

and O
consisted O
of O
a O

Each O

occurred O
22 O

the O
