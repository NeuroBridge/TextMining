To O

why O

it O
is O
important O
to O
look O
at O
how O
the O

people O
who O
use O
these O
substances O
may O
be O
different O
than O
those O

Many O

that O

via O
a O

Changes O

one O
tool O

can O
use O

explore O
such O

people O

Smokers O
had O
a O
low O
overall O

between O
brain O

Specifically O
, O
they O
had O

the O

These O

may O
make O
people O
more O

less O

to O
resist O

The O

may O

measures O
to O

the O

The O
main O

of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
there O
were O
differences O
in O
functional O

that O
were O
related O
to O
smoking O
or O

. O

Accordingly O
, O
in O
the O
initial O
analysis O
, O
we O
categorized O
the O
participants O
for O
the O
smoking O
analysis O
into O
two O
groups O
, O
one O
which O
used O
significant O

the O
other O
using O

The O

for O
the O

the O

that O
there O

reasonable O
numbers O

the O
high O

the O
low O
amount O
groups O

After O
the O
initial O
analysis O

we O
wished O
to O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
different O
amounts O
of O
use O
of O

, O
and O
therefore O
used O
measures O
of O
the O
different O

never O

The O
regular O

group O
included O
those O
who O
smoked O
at O

100 O

We O

another O

( O
the O

which O
included O

would O
considerably O

might O
