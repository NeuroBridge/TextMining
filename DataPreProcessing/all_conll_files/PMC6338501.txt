stimulation O
( O

modulates O

human O
participants O
by O
the O
application O
of O
a O
low-amplitude O
electrical O
current O
with O
a O
periodic O

. O

Yet O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
if O
tACS O
can O
modulate O
and O
restore O
neural O
oscillations O
that O
are O
reduced O
in O
patients O
with O
psychiatric O
illnesses O
such O
as O

. O

Here O
, O
we O
asked O
if O
tACS O
modulates O

in O
schizophrenia O
. O

We O
performed O
a O
randomized O
, O
double-blind O
, O
sham-controlled O
clinical O
trial O
to O
contrast O
tACS O
with O
transcranial O

( O

) O
and O
sham O

in O

. O

We O
used O
high-density O
electroencephalography O
to O
investigate O
if O
a O
five-day O
, O
twice-daily O
10HztACS O
protocol O
enhances O
alpha O
oscillations O
and O
modulates O
network O
dynamics O
that O
are O
reduced O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

We O
found O
that O
10Hz-tACS O
enhanced O
alpha O
oscillations O
and O
modulated O
functional O
connectivity O
in O
the O
alpha O
frequency O
band O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
10Hz-tACS O
enhanced O
the O
40Hz O
auditory O
steady-state O

( O
ASSR O
) O
, O
which O
is O
reduced O
in O
patients O

. O

Importantly O
, O
clinical O
improvement O
of O
auditory O

correlated O
with O
enhancement O
of O
alpha O
oscillations O
and O
the O
40Hz-ASSR O
. O

Together O
, O
our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
tACS O
has O
potential O
as O
a O
network-level O
approach O
to O
modulate O
reduced O
neural O

related O
