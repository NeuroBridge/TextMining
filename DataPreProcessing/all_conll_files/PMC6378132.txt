Background O
: O
Cognitive O
dysfunction O
is O
common O
in O
psychotic O
disorders O
, O
and O
may O
reflect O
underlying O
pathophysiology O
. O

However O
, O
substantial O
cognitive O
heterogeneity O
exists O
both O
within O
and O
between O
diagnostic O
categories O
, O
creating O
challenges O
for O
studying O
the O
neurobiology O
of O
cognitive O
dysfunction O
in O
patients O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
identify O
patients O
with O
psychosis O
with O
intact O
versus O
impaired O
cognitive O
profiles O
, O
and O
to O
examine O
resting O

functional O
connectivity O
between O
patient O
groups O
and O
compared O

to O
determine O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
patterns O

are O
overlapping O

. O

Methods O

Cognitive O
composite O

were O
used O
to O
identify O
groups O

Results O
: O
Both O
cognitively O
intact O
and O
cognitively O

patients O
showed O
decreased O
intrinsic O
connectivity O
compared O
to O
controls O
in O
frontoparietal O

Patients O

in O

compared O
to O
patients O
with O
intact O

Conclusions O
: O
We O
leveraged O
the O
heterogeneity O
in O
cognitive O
ability O
among O
patients O
with O
psychosis O
to O
disentangle O
the O
relative O
contributions O
of O
cognitive O
dysfunction O
and O
presence O
of O
an O
underlying O
psychotic O
illness O
using O

These O
findings O
suggest O
at O
least O
partially O
separable O
effects O
of O
presence O
of O
a O
psychotic O

neurocognitive O

contributing O
