calculated O
for O

previously O

This O
voxel-based O
functional O

involves O
correlating O
the O

any O
voxel O
with O
the O
time-course O
of O
every O

voxel O
in O
the O

Traditionally O

these O

summarized O
using O
a O

such O

Such O

In O

ICD O

Each O
point O

simply O
degree O

The O
ICD O
approach O
parameterizes O
the O
change O

defining O

Previously O
, O
we O
showed O
that O
it O
was O
sufficient O
to O
model O
this O
survival O
function O
as O
a O
stretched O
exponential O
decay O
with O
unknown O
variance O

and O
shape O
parameter O
: O
, O
where O
xis O
the O

location O
of O
a O
voxel O
, O
r O
is O
a O
correlation O
between O

time-courses O
, O
α O
is O

Modeling O
the O
survival O
function O
, O
, O
with O
a O
stretched O
exponential O
is O
equivalent O
to O
modeling O
the O
underlying O
distribution O
of O

, O
, O
as O
a O
Weibull O
distribution O

Thus O
, O
ICD O
models O
the O
distribution O
of O
correlations O
between O
a O
voxel O
and O
every O
other O
voxel O
in O
the O
brain O
, O
with O
α O
as O
the O
parameter O
of O
interest O
. O

No O
thresholds O
are O
needed O
to O
estimate O
the O
variance O
or O
model O
the O
distribution O
. O

This O
algorithm O
was O
performed O
for O
all O
voxels O
in O
the O
gray O
matter O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
parametric O
image O
where O
the O
value O
of O
each O
voxel O
represents O
the O
alpha O
parameter O
obtained O
from O
model O
fitting O
. O

Finally O
, O
each O
participant O
’ O
s O
map O
was O
normalized O
by O
subtracting O
the O
mean O
across O
all O
voxels O
and O
dividing O
by O
the O
standard O
deviation O
across O
all O
voxels O
. O

This O
normalization O
does O
not O
change O
the O
underlying O
connectivity O
pattern O
but O
ensures O
that O
all O
maps O
are O
equally O
scaled O
. O

Cross-hemisphere O
ICD O
To O
explore O

, O
we O
used O
a O
newly O

Like O
ICD O
, O
chICD O
involves O
correlating O
the O

a O
voxel O

with O
every O

time-course O
in O
the O
gray O

and O
then O
summarizing O
these O

. O

However O
, O
chICD O
separates O
the O

Specifically O

correlated O
with O

voxel O

ICD O
was O
used O
to O
model O

This O
procedure O
was O
performed O
for O
every O
voxel O

resulting O
in O
a O

representing O

the O

Similarly O
, O
a O

was O
calculated O

Both O

Finally O

that O
