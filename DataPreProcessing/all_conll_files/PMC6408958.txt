We O

a O

using O
Hi-C. O
With O
this O
in O

of O

, O
we O
mapped O

RESULTS O
: O
Neural O
differentiation O
was O
associated O
with O
genome-wide O
3DG O
remodeling O
, O
including O
pruning O
and O
de O
novo O
formations O
of O
chromosomal O
loopings O
. O

The O
NPC-to-neuron O
transition O
was O
defined O
by O
the O
pruning O
of O
loops O
involving O
regulators O
of O
cell O
proliferation O
, O
morphogenesis O
, O
and O
neurogenesis O
, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
a O
departure O
from O
a O
precursor O
stage O
toward O
postmitotic O
neuronal O
identity O
. O

Loops O
lost O
during O
NPC-to-glia O
transition O
included O
many O
genes O
associated O
with O
neuron-specific O
functions O
, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
non-neuronal O
lineage O
commitment O
. O

However O
, O
neurons O
together O
with O
NPCs O
, O
as O
compared O
with O
glia O
, O
harbored O
a O
much O
larger O
number O
of O
chromosomal O
interactions O
anchored O
in O
common O
variant O
sequences O
associated O
with O
SZ O
risk O
. O

Because O
spatial O
3DG O
proximity O
of O
genes O
is O
an O
indicator O
for O
potential O
coregulation O
, O
we O
tested O
whether O
the O
neural O
cell O
type–specific O
SZ-related O
“ O
chromosomal O
connectome O
” O
showed O
evidence O
of O
coordinated O
transcriptional O
regulation O
and O
proteomic O
interaction O
of O
the O
participating O
genes O
. O

To O
this O
end O
, O
we O
generated O
lists O
of O
genes O
anchored O
in O
cell O
type–specific O
SZ O
risk-associated O
interactions O
. O

Thus O
, O
for O
the O
NPC-specific O
interactions O
, O
we O
counted O
386 O
genes O
, O
including O
146 O
within O
the O
risk O
loci O
and O
another O
240 O
genes O
positioned O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
linear O
genome O
but O
connected O
via O
intrachromosomal O
contacts O
to O
risk O
locus O
sequences O
. O

Similarly O
, O
for O
the O
neuron-specific O
interactions O
, O
we O
identified O
385 O
genes O
: O
158 O
within O
risk O
loci O
and O
227 O
outside O
of O
risk O
loci O
. O

Last O
, O
for O
glia-specific O
interactions O
, O
we O
identified O
201 O
genes O
: O
88 O
within O
and O
113 O
outside O
of O
risk O
loci O
. O

We O
labeled O
the O
genes O
located O
outside O
of O
schizophrenia O
risk O
loci O
as O
“ O
risk O
locus–connect O
, O
” O
which O
we O
define O
as O
a O
collection O
of O
genes O
identified O
only O
through O
Hi-C O
interaction O
data O
, O
expanding—depending O
on O
cell O
type—by O

of O

overlapping O
risk O
sequences O
that O
is O
informed O
only O
by O

studies O
. O

This O
disease-related O
chromosomal O
connectome O
was O
associated O
with O
“ O
clusters O
” O
of O
coordinated O
gene O
expression O
and O

, O
with O
at O

one O

Our O

that O
