Hemispheric O
integration O

are O
two O
prominent O

Impairments O
of O
interhemispheric O
cooperation O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
schizophrenia O
patients O
, O
but O
whether O
such O
abnormalities O
should O
be O
attributed O
to O
effects O
of O
illness O
or O
familial O
risk O
remains O
inconclusive O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
how O
abnormalities O
in O
interhemispheric O
connectivity O
impact O
hemispheric O
specialization O
. O

To O
address O
these O
questions O
, O
we O
performed O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
( O
MRI O
) O
in O
a O
large O
cohort O
of O
253 O
participants O
, O
including O
84 O
schizophrenia O
patients O
, O
106 O
of O
their O
unaffected O
siblings O
and O
63 O
healthy O
controls O
. O

Interhemispheric O
connectivity O
and O
hemispheric O
specialization O
were O
calculated O
from O
resting-state O
functional O
connectivity O
, O
and O
compared O
across O
groups O
. O

Results O
showed O
that O
schizophrenia O
patients O
exhibit O
lower O
interhemispheric O
connectivity O
as O
compared O
to O
controls O
and O
siblings O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
patients O
showed O
higher O
levels O
of O
hemispheric O
specialization O
as O
compared O
to O
siblings O
. O

Level O
of O
interhemispheric O
connectivity O
and O
hemispheric O
specialization O
correlated O
with O
duration O
of O
illness O
in O
patients O
. O

No O
significant O
alterations O
were O
identified O
in O

relative O
to O

on O
both O
measurements O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
alterations O

interhemispheric O
connectivity O
correlated O
with O
changes O
in O
hemispheric O
specialization O
in O
patients O
relative O
to O
controls O
and O

. O

Taken O
together O
, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
lower O
interhemispheric O
connectivity O
and O
associated O
abnormalities O
in O
hemispheric O
specialization O
are O
features O
of O
established O

rather O
than O
an O
expression O
