Adolescent O
binge O

has O
been O
associated O
with O
higher O
risks O
for O
the O
development O
of O
many O
health O
problems O
throughout O
the O
lifespan O

Adolescents O
undergo O
multiple O
changes O
that O
involve O
the O
co-development O
processes O
of O
brain O
, O
personality O
and O
behavior O
; O
therefore O
, O
certain O
behavior O
, O
such O
as O
alcohol O
consumption O
, O
can O
have O
disruptive O
effects O
on O
both O
brain O
development O
and O
personality O
maturation O
. O

However O
, O
these O
effects O
remain O
unclear O
due O
to O
the O
scarcity O
of O
longitudinal O

In O
the O

study O

we O
used O

, O
and O

Taking O

we O
selected O

that O
were O
more O

altered O
in O

with O
an O

. O

With O
the O

we O

Using O
an O

, O
we O
tested O
the O
model O
and O
achieved O
a O

accuracy O
of O
71.2 O

. O

We O
demonstrated O
longitudinally O
that O
after O
the O

the O
