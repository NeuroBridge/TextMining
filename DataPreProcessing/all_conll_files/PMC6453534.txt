two O

Magnetoencephalography O

( O

To O
minimize O
top-down O

, O
the O
prime O

, O
the O

only O
140 O

participants O
simply O
monitored O
for O
words O
within O
a O
particular O
semantic O
category O
that O
appeared O
in O
filler O
trials O
. O

Both O
techniques O
revealed O
a O
significantly O
larger O
automatic O
indirect O

effect O
in O
people O
with O

than O
in O

MEG O

this O

to O
the O
N400 O

— O
the O
critical O
stage O
of O

fMRI O
spatially O
localized O
the O

to O
the O

which O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
mapping O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
an O
enhanced O
automatic O

effect O
in O
the O

These O
findings O
provide O
converging O
neural O
evidence O
for O
abnormally O
broad O
highly O
automatic O
lexico-semantic O
activity O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

We O
argue O
that O
, O
rather O
than O
arising O
from O
an O
unconstrained O
spread O
of O
automatic O
activation O
across O
semantic O
memory O
, O
this O
broader O
automatic O
lexico-semantic O
activity O
stems O

As O

not O

However O
, O
they O
did O

more O

the O

The O

No O

but O
across O
all O
participants O
, O
the O

in O
all O
three O

Thus O
, O

not O
be O
attributed O
to O

to O
the O
