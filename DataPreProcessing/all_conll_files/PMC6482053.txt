Working O
memory O
( O
WM O
) O
deficits O
are O
key O
features O
of O
schizophrenia O
and O
are O
associated O
with O
significant O
functional O
impairment O
. O

The O
precise O
mechanisms O
of O
WM O
and O
their O
relationship O
between O
WM O
deficits O
with O
other O
clinical O
symptoms O
of O
schizophrenia O
remain O
unclear O
. O

Contemporary O
models O
propose O
that O
WM O
requires O
synchronous O
activity O
across O
brain O
regions O
within O
a O
distributed O
network O
, O
including O
lateral O
prefrontal O
cortex O
( O
PFC O
) O
and O
task-relevant O
posterior O
sensory O
cortical O
regions O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
WM O
deficits O
in O
patients O
may O
be O
due O
to O
PFC O
functional O
connectivity O
( O
FC O
) O
impairments O
rather O
than O
activation O
impairments O
per O
se O
. O

We O
tested O
this O
hypothesis O
by O
measuring O
the O
magnitude O
of O
FC O
between O
lateral O
PFC O
and O
visual O
cortex O
and O
univariate O
activations O
within O
these O
regions O
during O
visual O
WM O
. O

We O
found O
decreased O
FC O
in O
patients O
compared O
to O
healthy O
subjects O
in O
the O
context O
of O
similar O
levels O
of O
univariate O

. O

Furthermore O
, O
this O
decreased O
FC O
was O
associated O
with O
task O
performance O
and O
clinical O
symptomatology O
in O
patients O
. O

The O
magnitude O
of O
FC O
, O
particularly O
during O
the O
delay O
period O
, O
was O
positively O
correlated O
with O
WM O
task O
accuracy O
, O
while O
FC O
during O

was O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
severity O

. O

Taken O
together O
, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O

is O
a O
key O

We O
designed O
a O
novel O
visual O
WM O
paradigm O
to O
facilitate O
the O
planned O
unbiased O
, O
functional O
ROI-based O
fMRI O
analyses O
. O

The O
design O
of O
our O
visual O
object O
WM O
task O
temporally O
segregates O
the O
phases O
of O
cue O
, O
delay O
, O
and O
probe O
. O

In O
this O
manner O
, O
this O
task O
can O
be O
considered O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
Sternberg O
Task O
. O

This O
design O
was O
chosen O
over O
a O
traditional O
N-back O
task O
in O
which O
the O
three O
phases O
can O
not O
be O
temporally O
separated O
. O

There O
were O
two O
tasks O
in O
this O
paradigm O
, O
which O
were O
identical O
in O
terms O
of O
trial O
structure O
, O
stimulus O
presentations O
, O
order O
and O
timing O
, O
but O
differed O
in O
WM O
requirements O
. O

The O
first O
stimulus O
presented O
in O
both O
tasks O
is O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
“ O
cue O
” O
face O
. O

It O
was O
displayed O
for O
one O
second O
and O
then O
it O
was O
replaced O
by O
a O
crosshair O
. O

The O
color O
of O
the O
crosshair O
was O
initially O
black O
, O
but O
changed O
color O
after O
two O
seconds O
. O

This O
new O
color O
indicated O
the O
task O
of O
the O
trial O
: O
blue O
indicated O
the O
WM O
task O
, O
which O
required O
subjects O
to O
maintain O
the O
cue O
face O
in O
WM O
across O
a O
15 O
s O
delay O
period O
and O
to O
make O
a O
match O
discrimination O
with O
the O
face O
appearing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
delay O
; O
red O
indicated O
the O
Gender O
ID O
( O
GID O
) O
task O
, O
which O
did O
not O
require O
WM O
for O
task O
completion O
but O
rather O
for O
the O
subjects O
to O
make O
a O
gender O
discrimination O
of O
the O
face O
appearing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
delay O
period O
. O

The O
faces O
shown O
were O
chosen O
to O
be O
gender O
ambiguous O
, O
so O
the O
results O
from O
the O
GID O
task O
are O
not O
expected O
to O
be O
meaningful O
. O

A O
critical O
aspect O
of O
the O
design O
was O
that O
the O
task O
for O
a O
particular O
trial O
was O
revealed O
only O
after O
cue O
face O
offset O
. O

This O
design O
forced O
subjects O
to O
encode O
into O
WM O
a O
cue O
face O
whenever O
it O
appeared O
, O
even O
during O
GID O
trials O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
trial O
task O
was O
revealed O
two O
seconds O
, O
and O
not O
immediately O
, O
after O
cue O
offset O
in O
order O
to O
enhance O
the O
temporal O
separation O
between O
the O
engagement O
of O
encoding O
and O
maintenance O
related O
neural O
processes O
by O
the O
subject O
. O

This O
temporal O
separation O
is O
necessary O
to O
disambiguate O
the O
BOLD O
signal O
reflecting O
encoding O
and O
maintenance O
related O
events O
. O

Subjects O
completed O
40 O
trials O
of O
each O
task O
. O

There O
were O
ten O
trials O
within O
each O
of O
eight O
runs O
. O

Trial O
order O
was O
randomly O
intermixed O
. O

To O
ensure O
that O
all O
subjects O
were O
engaged O
with O
the O
task O
, O
we O
imposed O
a O
performance O
criterion O
of O
60 O
% O
accuracy O
on O
the O
WM O
task O
. O

We O
chose O
a O
WM O
task O
that O
was O
not O
too O
difficult O
for O
both O
healthy O
control O
( O
HC O
) O
and O
schizophrenia O
( O
SZ O
) O
groups O
to O
accurately O
complete O
so O
that O
there O
would O
be O
sufficient O
number O
of O
correct O
trials O
with O
which O
to O
conduct O
the O
FC O
analyses O
. O

A O
task O
that O
was O
too O
difficult O
would O
likely O
have O
yielded O
a O
fairly O
large O
difference O
across O
groups O
in O
the O
number O
of O
correct O
trials O
. O

Low O
correct O
trial O
numbers O
in O
the O
patient O
group O
would O
reduce O
our O
ability O
to O
reliably O
measure O
true O
FC O
strength O
and O
a O
large O
group O
difference O
in O
trial O
numbers O
could O
introduce O
bias O
in O
terms O
of O
group O

. O

we O

Localization O

Given O
the O

brain O
regions O
involved O
in O
visual O
WM O
and O
the O

with O
these O
ROIs O
, O
we O
did O
not O
employ O
a O
whole O
brain O
, O
voxel-wise O
analysis O
and O
instead O
we O
utilized O
an O
ROI O

approach O
for O
hypothesis O

This O
approached O

a O

the O
ROIs O
to O
be O
analyzed O
( O
lateral O

) O
. O

We O
utilized O
functional O
ROIs O
, O
rather O
than O
anatomic O
ROIs O
, O
for O
hypothesis O
testing O
to O
enhance O

. O

The O
lateral O

is O
a O
relatively O
broad O
region O
that O

. O

Thus O
, O
the O
use O
of O
anatomically O
defined O

of O
the O

would O
likely O
significantly O
diminish O
our O

. O

One O
of O
the O
major O

in O

is O
the O
“ O

We O
avoided O
this O
problem O
by O
using O

e.g O

used O
these O
