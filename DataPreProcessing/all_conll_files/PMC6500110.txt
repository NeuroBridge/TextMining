Historically O

most O
research O
on O
the O
biological O
origins O

illness O
has O
focused O
on O
individual O
diagnostic O

studied O

Mounting O

that O
nominally O

not O

clear O
neurobiological O
boundaries O

Here O
, O
we O
derive O
functional O

in O
over O
1,000 O
individuals O
, O
including O
patients O
presenting O
with O
different O

) O
, O
clinical O
diagnoses O
, O
and O
severity O
of O
illness O
as O
reflected O
in O

. O

Our O
analyses O
reveal O

Conversely O
, O
other O
aspects O

were O
preferentially O

in O

These O

important O

the O

Converging O

that O

The O
