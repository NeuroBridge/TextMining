A O

that O
genomic O

both O

Moreover O
, O

In O
this O
work O
, O
we O
proposed O
a O
genome-connectome O

model O
to O
perform O
imaging O

Functional O

( O

was O
estimated O
after O

from O

( O

Then O
83 O
FNC O

( O

were O
selected O
as O
fMRI O
nodes O
, O
and O
eighty-one O
schizophrenia-related O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
( O

) O
were O
selected O
as O
genetic O
nodes O
respectively O
in O
the O
bipartite O
graph O
. O

Edges O

genetic O

were O
defined O
based O
on O
the O
SNP-FNC O
associations O
across O

evaluated O
by O
a O
general O

. O

Results O
show O
that O
some O
SNP O
nodes O
in O
the O
bipartite O
graph O
have O
a O
high O
degree O
implying O
they O
are O
influential O
in O
modulating O
brain O
connectivity O
and O
may O
be O
more O
strongly O
associated O
with O
the O
risk O
of O

than O
other O
SNPs O
. O

A O
bi-clustering O

detected O
a O
cluster O

15 O

interacting O

FNC O
connections O
, O
most O
of O
which O
were O
within O
or O
between O
somato-motor O
and O

brain O
areas O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
activity O
of O
these O

may O
be O
related O
to O
common O

and O
provides O
insights O

The O

a O
novel O
