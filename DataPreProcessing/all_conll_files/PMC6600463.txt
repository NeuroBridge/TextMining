studies O
examining O
differences O
in O
D1-dopamine O
receptor O
binding O
between O
control O
subjects O

have O
been O
inconsistent O
, O
reporting O
higher O
, O
lower O
, O
and O
no O
difference O
in O
the O
frontal O
cortex O
. O

Exposure O
to O
antipsychotic O
medication O
has O
been O
suggested O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
source O
of O
this O
heterogeneity O
, O
and O
thus O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
studies O
of O
patients O
at O

Here O
, O
we O
compared O

18 O
first-episode O

. O

Results O
We O
observed O
a O
statistically O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
dorsolateral O
prefrontal O
cortex O
. O

Contrary O
to O
our O
expectations O
, O
patients O
had O
less O
D1-dopamine O
receptor O
availability O
with O
a O
moderate O
effect O
size O
. O

In O
a O
Bayesian O
analysis O
, O
we O
show O
that O
the O
data O
are O
over O
50 O
times O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
occurred O
under O
the O
decrease O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
increase O
hypothesis O
. O

This O
effect O
was O
not O
global O
, O
as O
our O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
null O
hypothesis O
was O
preferred O
over O
either O
hypothesis O
in O
the O
striatum O
. O

Conclusions O
This O
investigation O
represents O
the O
largest O
single O
sample O
of O
neuroleptic-naive O
patients O
examined O
for O
D1-dopamine O
receptor O
availability O
using O
PET O

suggests O
a O
reduction O

MRI O
Examination O
All O

In O

Statistical O

The O

For O

For O

This O

For O
the O
assessment O
of O
the O

we O
tailored O

For O
the O

, O
we O
made O
use O
of O
a O
2-sided O

, O
due O
to O

using O
an O

For O
the O
Bayesian O

, O
we O
made O
use O
of O

For O
the O

, O
we O
defined O

Previous O
studies O
making O
use O
of O
[ O

] O
NNC112 O
were O
not O
included O
, O
as O
the O
percentage O

may O
not O
be O
directly O
applicable O
to O
[ O
11C O
] O
SCH23390 O
BPND O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
[ O
11C O
] O
NNC112 O
has O
a O
significantly O
higher O
affinity O
for O
the O
D1R O
. O

Second O
, O
for O
both O
radioligands O
5-HT2A O
receptor O
binding O
contributes O
to O
a O
nonnegligible O
fraction O
of O
cortical O
binding O
, O
and O
differences O
in O
this O
fraction O
might O
cause O
systematic O
differences O
. O

Although O
this O
fraction O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
similar O
in O
magnitude O
for O
both O
tracers O
, O
for O
[ O
11C O
] O
SCH23390 O
this O
estimate O
was O
derived O
from O
a O
PET O
examination O
of O
only O
2 O
baboons O
and O
not O
from O
humans O
. O

Lastly O
, O
in O
studies O
using O
[ O
11C O
] O
NNC112 O
, O
the O
main O
outcome O
parameter O
has O
been O
BPP O
, O
with O
BPND O
calculated O
in O
all O
cases O
but O
one O
using O
arterial O
plasma O
measurements O
. O

To O
assure O
that O
these O
hypotheses O
were O
not O
differentially O
influenced O
by O
different O
sizes O
of O
previously O
reported O
effects O
, O
we O
opted O
to O
use O
the O
same O
scale O
for O
both O
the O
increase O
and O
decrease O
prior O
based O
on O
a O
weighted O
average O
of O
previous O
differences O
. O

We O
therefore O
used O
a O
SD O
of O
31 O
% O
for O
DLPFC O
and O
of O
21 O
% O
for O
the O
STR O
. O

details O
regarding O

We O
also O
tested O
whether O
other O
factors O
differing O
between O
measurements O
might O
have O
a O
substantial O
impact O
on O
the O
results O
and O
thereby O
act O
as O
a O
confounder O
. O

These O
factors O
relate O
to O

. O

For O
the O
assessment O
of O
whether O
BPND O
was O
affected O
by O
participant O
sex O
, O
we O
also O
made O
use O
of O
the O

data O
from O
de O
Boer O

, O
with O

but O
with O
image O
analysis O
and O
modelling O
performed O
in O
a O
manner O
identical O
to O
the O
present O
study O
. O

To O
assess O
whether O
these O
factors O
impacted O
our O
outcomes O
, O
we O
tested O
whether O
a O
large O
specific O
effect O
was O
absent O
for O
each O
factor O
. O

Such O
conclusions O
can O
not O
be O
drawn O
from O
an O
insignificant O
P O
value O
assessing O
the O
differences O
between O
groups O
but O
rather O
requires O
a O
test O
of O
groups O
’ O
similarity O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
we O
made O
use O
of O
equivalence O
testing O
. O

This O
allows O
for O
testing O
of O
the O
equivalence O
of O
outcomes O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
difference O
, O
and O
requires O
the O
description O
of O
appropriate O
equivalence O
bounds O
within O
which O
the O
outcomes O
are O
assumed O
to O
be O
sufficiently O
similar O
. O

We O
performed O
a O
power O
analysis O
for O
the O
equivalence O
bound O
for O
2-sample O
equivalence O
tests O
with O
a O
type O
I O
error O
rate O
of O
0.05 O
, O
a O
power O
of O
0.8 O
, O
and O
samples O
of O
18 O
in O
each O
group O
. O

According O
to O
this O
analysis O
, O
there O
was O
sufficient O
power O
to O
assess O
equivalence O
within O
bounds O
of O
−1 O
< O
Cohen O
’ O
s O
D O
< O
1 O
. O

Since O
Cohen O
’ O
s O
D O
= O
0.8 O
represents O
a O
large O
effect O
size O
, O
we O
can O
thereby O
rule O
out O
large O
effects O
. O

While O
it O
would O
have O
been O
desirable O
to O
assess O
equivalence O
within O
more O
restrictive O
equivalence O
bounds O
, O
this O
approach O
is O
nonetheless O
superior O
to O
the O
statistically O
invalid O
approach O
of O
accepting O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
failing O
to O
reject O
) O
the O
null O

Transparency O
Statement O
We O
present O
the O
following O
transparency O
statement O
suggested O
by O
Simmons O
et O
al O
.. O
All O
requirements O
are O
presented O
below O
. O

We O
report O
how O
we O
determined O
our O
sample O
size O
, O
all O
data O
exclusions O
( O
if O
any O
) O
, O
all O
manipulations O
, O
and O
all O
measures O
in O
the O
study O
. O

Sample O
Size O
Determination O
The O
final O
study O
sample O
size O
was O
determined O
by O
the O
number O
of O
participants O
included O
in O
the O
study O
when O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
data O
collection O
was O
to O
be O
concluded O
in O
2008 O
and O
consisted O
of O
18 O
patients O
and O
18 O
healthy O
controls O
. O

No O
power O
analysis O
was O
performed O
before O
or O
during O
the O
study O
; O
however O
, O
a O
power O
analysis O
was O
performed O
prior O
to O
statistical O
analysis O
. O

For O
a O
2 O
independent O
sample O
t O
test O
, O
with O
an O
alpha O
of O
0.05 O
, O
this O
study O
had O
80 O
% O
power O
to O
detect O
an O
effect O
size O
of O
Cohen O
’ O
s O
D O
= O
0.96 O
. O

This O
corresponds O
to O
a O
Cohen O
’ O
s O
U3 O
of O
83 O
% O
and O
a O
common O
language O
effect O
size O
of O
75 O
% O
. O

This O
effect O
is O
larger O
than O
we O
would O
expect O
, O
and O
we O
determined O
a O
priori O
that O
if O
significant O
, O
this O
result O
could O
likely O
represent O
a O
Type O
M O
error O
, O
and O
if O
insignificant O
, O
this O
result O
could O
likely O
represent O
a O
Type O
II O
error O
. O

Exclusions O
One O
PET O
measurement O
from O
a O
control O
subject O
was O
excluded O
from O
the O

since O
it O
was O
only O
stored O
on O
an O
optical O

whose O
content O
could O
not O
be O
accessed O
. O

All O
other O
measurements O
were O
included O
in O
the O
analysis O
. O

Measures O
and O
Analyses O
The O
authors O
confirm O
that O
all O
ROI O

was O
performed O
blind O
to O
the O
patient O
or O

of O
the O
subjects O
and O
that O
no O

other O
than O
the O
whole O
STR O
and O
the O
DLPFC O
were O
analyzed O
. O

All O
confounder O
checks O
were O
analyzed O
without O

whether O
they O
influenced O
the O

, O
and O

other O
than O
that O
of O

, O
where O
it O
was O
the O

. O

For O
transparency O
, O
we O
note O
that O
an O
exploratory O
SPM O
analysis O
was O
run O
on O
a O
subset O
of O
subjects O
during O
the O

phase O
for O
which O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O

the O

using O
conventional O
statistical O

. O

Hence O
, O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
findings O
guiding O
the O
ROI O

. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
the O
differences O
in O
MR O

, O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
analysis O
was O
not O
corrected O
for O
different O

of O

In O
