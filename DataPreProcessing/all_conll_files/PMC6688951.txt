Background O

Converging O
evidence O
implicates O
abnormal O

in O
the O

This O

MRI O
of O

thalamus O
with O
somatosensory O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
these O
abnormalities O
would O
be O
correlated O
, O
reflecting O
a O
common O
mechanism O
: O
reduced O
inhibition O
of O
thalamocortical O
neurons O
by O
the O
thalamic O
reticular O
nucleus O
( O
TRN O
) O
, O
which O

the O
major O

nucleus O
of O

is O
abnormal O
in O

Reduced O
TRN O

Results O

As O

Conclusions O
: O
These O
findings O

If O

schizophrenia O

its O
