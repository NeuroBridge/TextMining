Briefly O

the O
JICA O

utilizes O

information O

information O

to O

and O
identify O
“ O

maximize O

This O
approach O
identifies O
“ O

” O
which O
covary O
the O

The O
algorithm O
outputs O

, O
which O
reflect O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
joint O

A O
priori O
, O
we O
planned O
to O
investigate O
components O
with O
time O
courses O
that O
correlated O
with O
the O
N400 O
and O
regressed O
those O
time O
courses O
onto O
the O
N400 O
grand O
average O
ERP O
to O
assist O
with O
component O

. O

We O
estimated O
the O
number O
of O
components O
to O
calculate O
based O
on O
minimum O
descriptive O
length O
criteria O
for O
fMRI O
and O
a O
parallel O
test O
for O
ERP O
for O
each O
feature O
. O

Given O
the O
primacy O
of O
our O
interest O
in O
identifying O
a O
joint O
component O
that O
clearly O
captured O
the O
N400 O
difference O
wave O
in O
the O
ERP O
waveforms O
, O
we O
considered O
ICA O
solutions O
involving O
extractions O
of O
between O
2 O
and O
7 O
components O
. O

After O
reviewing O
the O
components O
resulting O
from O
these O
solutions O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
2-component O
solution O
yielded O
a O
joint O
component O
that O
clearly O
captured O
the O
N400 O
difference O
waveform O
for O
both O
IC O
and O
OC O
conditions O
( O

. O

Accordingly O
, O
this O
joint O
component O
was O
extracted O
and O
used O
in O
our O
subsequent O
analyses O
. O

Given O
our O
interest O
in O
identifying O
regions O
correlated O
with O
the O
N400 O

we O
focused O
our O
follow-up O
analyses O

All O
voxels O

the O

that O
are O
most O
strongly O

the O

In O
our O
analyses O
, O
the O

revealed O
a O
max O
z-score O
of O
~8 O
for O
the O
OC O

max O
z-score O

so O
we O
selected O

approximated O
