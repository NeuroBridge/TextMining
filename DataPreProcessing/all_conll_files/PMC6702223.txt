Evidence O

cerebello-thalamo-cortical O
hyperconnectivity O
as O
a O

for O

Our O
recent O
study O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
increased O
connectivity O
in O
the O
cerebello-thalamo-cortical O
( O
CTC O
) O
circuitry O
is O
a O
state-independent O
neural O
trait O
that O
can O
potentially O
predict O
the O
onset O
of O
psychosis O
. O

One O
possible O
cause O
of O
such O
“ O
trait O
” O
abnormality O
would O
be O
genetic O
predisposition O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
tested O
this O
hypothesis O
using O
multi-paradigm O
functional O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
( O
fMRI O
) O
data O
from O
two O
independent O
twin O
cohorts O
. O

In O
a O
sample O
of O
85 O
monozygotic O
( O
MZ O
) O
and O
52 O
dizygotic O
( O
DZ O
) O
healthy O
twin O
pairs O
acquired O
from O
the O
Human O
Connectome O
Project O
, O
we O
showed O
that O
the O
connectivity O
pattern O
of O
the O
identified O
CTC O
circuitry O
was O
more O
similar O
in O
the O
MZ O
twins O
( O

0.54 O
) O
compared O
with O
that O
in O
the O
DZ O
twins O
( O
r O
= O
0.22 O
) O
. O

The O
structural O
equation O

analysis O
revealed O
a O
heritability O
estimate O
of O
0.52 O
for O
the O
CTC O
connectivity O
, O
suggesting O
a O
moderately O
strong O
genetic O
effect O
. O

Moreover O
, O
using O
an O
independent O

sample O
( O

) O
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
linear O
relationship O
between O
genetic O
distance O
to O
schizophrenia O
and O
the O

in O
the O

The O
present O
data O
provide O
converging O
evidence O
that O
increased O
connectivity O
in O
the O
CTC O
circuitry O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
