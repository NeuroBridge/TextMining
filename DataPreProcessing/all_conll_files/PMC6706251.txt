Both O

Here O
, O
we O
examined O
the O
effects O
of O
cocaine O

and O
HIV O

in O
69 O
adults O
who O
underwent O
functional O
magnetic O

( O

) O
while O
completing O
an O

. O

We O
identified O
two O
neural O
networks O
that O
correlated O
with O
the O
evaluation O
of O
the O
favorable O
characteristics O
of O
the O
gamble O
( O
i.e. O
, O

. O

Behaviorally O
, O
cocaine O
and O
HIV O
had O
additive O
effects O
on O
loss O

scores O
, O
with O
HIV-positive O
cocaine O
users O
being O
the O
least O

. O

Cocaine O
users O
had O
greater O
activation O
in O
brain O
regions O
that O
tracked O
the O
favorability O
of O
gamble O
characteristics O
( O
i.e. O
, O
increased O
activation O
to O
gains O
, O
but O
decreased O
activation O
to O
losses O
) O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
HIV O
infection O
was O
independently O
associated O
with O
lesser O
activation O
in O
regions O
that O
tracked O
the O
unfavorability O
of O

characteristics O
. O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
cocaine O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
overactive O
reward-seeking O
system O
, O
while O
HIV O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
underactive O
cognitive O

system O
. O

Together O
, O
these O
alterations O
may O
leave O
HIV-positive O

vulnerable O

making O
unfavorable O
