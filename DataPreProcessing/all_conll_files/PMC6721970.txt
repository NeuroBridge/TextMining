Background O

Previous O
neuroimaging O
studies O
examining O
relations O
between O
alcohol O
misuse O
and O
cortical O
thickness O
have O
revealed O
that O
increased O
drinking O
quantity O
and O
alcohol-related O
problems O
are O
associated O
with O
thinner O
cortex O
. O

Although O
conflicting O
regional O
effects O
are O
often O
observed O
, O
associations O
are O
generally O
localized O
to O
frontal O
regions O
( O
e.g. O
, O
dorsolateral O

cortex O
( O
DLPFC O
) O
, O
inferior O
frontal O
gyrus O
( O
IFG O
) O
, O
and O
anterior O
cingulate O
cortex O
) O
. O

Inconsistent O
findings O
may O
be O
attributed O
to O
methodological O
differences O
, O
modest O
sample O

, O
and O
limited O

Alcohol O
Variables O
Two O
alcohol O
variables O
from O
the O
HCP O
dataset O
were O
examined O
in O
the O
current O
study O
. O

The O
first O
, O
“ O
Total O
drinks O
in O
past O
7 O
days O
” O
, O
was O
taken O
from O
the O
retrospective O
alcohol O
use O
assessment O
. O

The O
second O
, O
“ O
Frequency O
of O
drinking O
5+ O
drinks O
in O
past O
12 O
months O
” O
, O
was O
taken O
from O
the O
SSAGA O
assessment O
. O

This O
variable O
was O
coded O
categorically O
in O
the O
HCP O
dataset O
, O
but O
the O
coding O
for O
the O
highest O
frequency O
differed O
for O
males O
and O
females O
( O
i.e. O
, O
the O
maximum O
response O
of O
3+ O
days/week O
was O
coded O
as O
1 O
for O
males O
, O
but O
2 O
for O
females O
) O
. O

The O
next O
lowest O
value O
( O
1–2 O
days/week O
) O
was O
coded O
as O
2 O
for O
both O
males O
and O
females O
. O

Therefore O
, O
no O
distinction O
could O
be O
made O
between O
1–2 O
vs. O
3+ O
days/week O
for O
females O
. O

To O
standardize O
the O
maximum O
response O
, O
the O
data O
were O
recoded O
as O

( O
and O
reverse-scored O
such O
that O
higher O

greater O

We O
examined O

that O
were O
chosen O
based O
on O

Specifically O
, O
we O
identified O
18 O
bilateral O
ROIs O
that O
have O
shown O
significant O
differences O
in O
at O

one O
of O

Following O
conventions O
used O
in O
prior O

( O
e.g. O
, O

, O
a O

, O

, O
reducing O
the O
number O
of O

The O
ACC O
composite O
region O
was O
created O
by O
combining O
the O
caudal O
and O
rostral O
ACC O
segments O
. O

The O
DLPFC O
composite O
was O
created O
by O
combining O
the O

MFG O
, O
rostral O
MFG O
, O
and O
the O

. O

Lastly O
, O
the O
OFC O
composite O
was O
created O
by O
combining O
the O
lateral O

OFC O
segments O
. O

The O
