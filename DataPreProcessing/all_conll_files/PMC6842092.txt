Functional O

of O

disorder O
Background O
: O
The O
striatum O
is O
abnormal O
in O
schizophrenia O
, O
and O
possibly O
represents O
a O
common O
neurobiological O
mechanism O
underlying O
psychotic O
disorders O
. O

Resting-state O
fMRI O
( O
RS-fMRI O
) O
studies O
have O
not O
reached O
a O
consensus O
regarding O
striatal O
dysconnectivity O
in O
schizophrenia O
, O
although O
these O
studies O
generally O
find O
impaired O
fronto-parietal O
and O
salience O
network O
connectivity O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
clarify O
the O
pattern O
of O
cortico-striatal O
connectivity O
, O
including O
whether O
cortico-striatal O
dysconnectivity O
is O
transdiagnostic O
and O
extends O
into O
psychotic O
bipolar O
disorder O
. O

Methods O
: O
We O
examined O
cortico-striatal O
functional O
connectivity O
in O
60 O
healthy O
subjects O
and O
117 O
individuals O
with O
psychosis O
, O
including O
77 O
with O
a O
schizophrenia O
spectrum O
illness O
and O
40 O
with O
psychotic O
bipolar O
disorder O
. O

We O
conducted O
both O
a O
cortical O
seed-based O
region-of-interest O
( O
ROI O
) O
analysis O
with O
follow-up O
voxel-wise O
analysis O
for O
any O
significant O
results O
. O

Further O
, O
a O
striatum O
seed-based O
analysis O
was O
conducted O
to O
examine O
group O
differences O
in O
connectivity O
between O
the O
striatum O
and O
the O
whole O
cortex O
. O

Results O
: O
Cortical O
ROI O
analysis O
indicated O
that O
overall O
connectivity O
of O
the O
salience O
network O
with O
the O
striatum O
was O
reduced O
in O
psychotic O
disorders O
, O
which O
follow-up O
voxel-wise O
analysis O
localized O
to O
the O
left O
putamen O
. O

Striatum O
seed-based O
analyses O
showed O
reduced O
ventral O
rostral O
putamen O
connectivity O
with O
the O
salience O
network O
portion O
of O
the O
medial O
PFC O
in O
both O
schizophrenia O
and O
psychotic O
bipolar O
disorders O
. O

Conclusions O
: O
The O
current O
study O
found O
evidence O
of O
transdiagnostic O
cortico-striatal O
dysconnectivity O
in O
both O
schizophrenia O
and O
psychotic O
bipolar O
disorder O
, O
including O
reduced O
salience O
network O
connectivity O
, O
as O
well O
as O
reduced O
connectivity O
between O
the O
putamen O
and O
the O
medial O
PFC O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
current O
study O
points O
to O
the O
relative O
importance O
of O
salience O
network O
hypo-connectivity O
in O
psychotic O
disorders O
