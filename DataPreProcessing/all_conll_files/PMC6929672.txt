Abstract O
Background O
Individuals O
with O
cocaine O
addiction O
are O
characterized O
by O
under-responsiveness O
to O
natural O
reinforcers O
. O

As O
part O
of O
the O
dopaminergic O
pathways O
, O
the O
hypothalamus O
supports O
motivated O
behaviors O
. O

Rodent O
studies O
suggested O
inter-related O
roles O
of O
the O
hypothalamus O
in O
regulating O
drug O
and O
food O
intake O
. O

However O
, O
few O
studies O
have O
investigated O
hypothalamic O
responses O
to O
drugs O
and O
food O
or O
related O
cues O
in O
humans O
. O

Methods O
We O
examined O
regional O
responses O
in O
20 O
cocaine-dependent O
and O
24 O
healthy O
control O
participants O
exposed O
to O
cocaine/food O
( O
cocaine O
dependent O
) O
and O
food O
( O
healthy O
control O
) O
vs O
neutral O
cues O
during O
functional O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
. O

We O
examined O
the O
relationship O
between O
imaging O
findings O
and O
clinical O
variables O
and O
performed O
mediation O
analyses O
to O
examine O
the O
inter-relationships O
between O
cue-related O
activations O
, O
tonic O
cocaine O
craving O
, O
and O
recent O
cocaine O
use O
. O

Results O
At O
a O
corrected O
threshold O
, O
cocaine-dependent O
participants O
demonstrated O
higher O
activation O
to O
cocaine O
than O
to O
food O
cues O
in O
the O
hypothalamus O
, O
inferior O
parietal O
cortex O
, O
and O
visual O
cortex O
. O

Cocaine-dependent O
participants O
as O
compared O
with O
healthy O
control O
participants O
also O
demonstrated O
higher O
hypothalamic O
activation O
to O
food O
cues O
. O

Further O
, O
the O
extent O
of O
these O
cue-induced O
hypothalamic O
activations O
was O
correlated O
with O
tonic O
craving O
, O
as O
assessed O
by O
the O
Cocaine O
Craving O
Questionnaire O
, O
and O
days O
of O
cocaine O
use O
in O
the O
prior O
month O
. O

In O
mediation O
analyses O
, O
hypothalamic O
activation O
to O
cocaine O
and O
food O
cues O
both O
completely O
mediated O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
Cocaine O
Craving O
Questionnaire O
score O
and O
days O
of O
cocaine O
use O
in O
the O
past O
month O
. O

Conclusions O
The O
results O
were O
consistent O
with O
the O
proposition O
that O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
feeding O
and O
drug O
addiction O
are O
inter-linked O
in O
the O
hypothalamus O
and O
altered O
in O
cocaine O
addiction O
. O

The O
findings O
provide O
new O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
hypothalamic O
dysfunction O
in O
cocaine O
addiction O

Because O

we O
included O
a O
