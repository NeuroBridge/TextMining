Craving O

is O
associated O

networks O
. O

Background O
: O
The O
insula O
has O
a O
well-established O
role O
in O
nicotine O
dependence O
and O
is O
a O
node O
of O
the O
salience O
network O
( O
SN O
) O
, O
which O
integrates O
internal O
and O
external O
information O
to O
guide O
behavior O
. O

Recent O
findings O
reveal O
that O
internal O
and O
external O
processing O
occurs O
in O
the O
ventral O
and O
dorsal O
anterior O
insula O
( O
vAI/dAI O
) O
, O
respectively O
. O

Whether O
vAI/dAI O
network O
connectivity O
differentially O
reflects O
internally-generated O
craving O
and O
externally-triggered O
smoking O
cue O
reactivity O
was O
tested O
. O

Methods O
: O
Thirty-six O
male O
and O
female O
nicotine-dependent O
individuals O
smoked O
1 O

before O
functional O

Baseline O

was O
measured O
, O
followed O
by O
resting-state O
and O
smoking O
cue-reactivity O
scans O
, O
and O
another O
assessment O
of O
craving O
. O

Craving O
and O
cue-reactivity O
interactions O
were O
measured O
by O
focusing O
on O
specific O
nodes O
of O
the O
SN O
: O
the O
vAI/dAI O
and O
anterior O
cingulate O
cortex O
( O
ACC O
) O
. O

Results O
: O
Resting-state O
vAI/dAI O
networks O
overlapped O
with O
the O
prototypical O
SN O
, O
yet O
they O
possess O
distinct O
patterns O
, O
linking O
the O
vAI O
with O
nodes O
of O
the O
internally-focused O
default O
mode O
network O
( O
DMN O
) O
and O
the O
dAI O
with O
nodes O
of O
the O
external/goal-related O
frontoparietal O
network O
( O
FPN O
) O
. O

Internally O
generated O
baseline O
craving O
was O
associated O
with O
enhanced O
vAI O
connectivity O
while O
rostral O
ACC O
( O
rACC O
) O
reactivity O
to O
external O
smoking O
cues O
was O
associated O
with O
greater O
dAI O
connectivity O
. O

We O
also O
found O
that O
cue O
reactivity O
in O
the O
rACC O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
rise O
in O
subjective O
cue-induced O
craving O
, O
while O
baseline O
subjective O
craving O
did O
not O
influence O
brain O
cue-reactivity O
. O

Conclusions O
: O
These O
data O
show O
that O
brain O
reactivity O
to O
smoking O
cues O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
subsequent O
increase O
in O
craving O
