, O
the O

Evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
globus O
pallidus O
externus O
( O
GPe O
) O
, O
a O
substructure O
within O
the O
basal O
ganglia O
, O
participates O
in O
inhibitory O
control O
processes O
, O
as O
examined O
in O
stop-signaling O
tasks O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
studies O
in O
rodents O
have O
revealed O
that O
alcohol O
can O
change O
GPe O
activity O
by O
decreasing O
neuronal O

rates O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
GPe O
may O
have O
a O
central O
role O
in O
explaining O
impulsive O
behaviors O
and O
failures O
of O

that O
occur O
during O
binge O

. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
twenty-five O
healthy O

underwent O
intravenous O
alcohol O
infusion O
to O
achieve O
a O
blood O
alcohol O
level O
of O
0.08 O
g/dl O
, O
which O
is O
equivalent O
to O
a O
binge O
drinking O
episode O
. O

A O

functional O
magnetic O

was O
collected O
prior O
to O
the O
infusion O
and O
at O

Functional O

was O
used O
to O
investigate O
the O
association O
between O
alcohol-induced O
changes O
in O
GPe O
connectivity O
, O
drinking O
behaviors O
, O
and O
impulsivity O

. O

We O
found O
that O
individuals O
with O
greater O
number O
of O
drinks O
or O
heavy O

days O
in O
the O
recent O
past O
had O
greater O
alcohol-induced O
deficits O
in O
GPe O
connectivity O
, O
particularly O
to O
the O
striatum O
. O

Our O
data O
also O
indicated O
an O
association O
between O
impulsivity O
and O
alcohol-induced O
deficits O
in O
GPe—frontal/precentral O
connectivity O
. O

Moreover O
, O
alcohol O
induced O
changes O
in O
GPe-amygdala O
circuitry O
suggested O
greater O
vulnerabilities O
to O
stress-related O
drinking O
in O
some O
individuals O
. O

Taken O
together O
, O
these O
findings O
suggest O
that O
alcohol O
may O
interact O
with O
impulsive O
personality O
traits O
and O
drinking O
patterns O
to O
drive O
alterations O
in O
GPe O
circuitry O
associated O
with O
behavioral O
inhibition O
, O
possibly O
indicating O
a O
neural O
mechanism O
by O
which O

could O
lead O
