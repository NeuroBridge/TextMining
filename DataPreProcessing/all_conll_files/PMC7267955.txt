Abstract O
Schizophrenia O
has O
been O
conceptualized O
as O
a O
disorder O
arising O
from O
structurally O
pathological O
alterations O
to O
white‐matter O
fibers O
in O
the O
brain O
. O

However O
, O
few O
studies O
have O
focused O
on O
white‐matter O
functional O
changes O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

Considering O
that O
converging O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
white‐matter O
resting O
state O
functional O
MRI O
( O
rsfMRI O
) O
signals O
can O
effectively O
depict O
neuronal O
activity O
and O
psychopathological O
status O
, O
this O
study O
examined O
white‐matter O
network‐level O
interactions O
in O
antipsychotic‐naive O
first‐episode O
schizophrenia O
( O
FES O
) O
to O
facilitate O
the O
interpretation O
of O
the O
psychiatric O
pathological O
mechanisms O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

We O
recruited O
42 O
FES O
patients O
( O
FESs O
) O
and O
38 O
healthy O
controls O
( O
HCs O
) O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
underwent O
rsfMRI O
. O

We O
identified O
11 O
white‐matter O
functional O
networks O
, O
which O
could O
be O
further O
classified O
into O
deep O
, O
middle O
, O
and O
superficial O
layers O
of O
networks O
. O

We O
then O
examined O
network‐level O
interactions O
among O
these O
11 O
white‐matter O
functional O
networks O
using O
coefficient O
Granger O
causality O
analysis O
. O

We O
employed O
group O
comparisons O
on O
the O
influences O
among O
11 O
networks O
using O
network‐based O
statistic O
. O

Excitatory O
influences O
from O
the O
middle O
superior O
corona O
radiate O
network O
to O
the O
superficial O
orbitofrontal O
and O
deep O
networks O
were O
disrupted O
in O
FESs O
compared O
with O
HCs O
. O

Additionally O
, O
an O
extra O
failure O
of O
suppression O
within O
superficial O
networks O
( O
including O
the O
frontoparietal O
network O
, O
temporofrontal O
network O
, O
and O
the O
orbitofrontal O
network O
) O
was O
observed O
in O
FESs O
. O

We O
additionally O
recruited O
an O
independent O
cohort O
( O
13 O
FESs O
and O
13 O
HCs O
) O
from O
another O
center O
to O
examine O
the O
replicability O
of O
our O
findings O
across O
centers O
. O

Similar O
replication O
results O
further O
verified O
the O
white‐matter O
functional O
network O
interaction O
model O
of O
schizophrenia O
. O

The O
novel O
findings O
of O
impaired O
interactions O
among O
white‐matter O
functional O
networks O
in O
schizophrenia O
indicate O
that O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
schizophrenia O
may O
also O
lie O
in O
white‐matter O
functional O
