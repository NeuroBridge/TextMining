which O
we O
have O
used O
to O
already O
publish O

from O
the O

. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
each O
trial O
, O
participants O
viewed O
one O
of O
three O
symbols O
( O
a O
cue O
) O
that O
indicated O
the O
potential O
to O
gain O
fifty O
pence O
( O

. O

Each O
cue O
was O
presented O
for O
one O
second O
, O
with O
a O
variable O
duration O
( O
2–4 O
s O
) O
for O
the O
subsequent O
anticipation O
period O
. O

Following O
the O
anticipation O
period O
, O
participants O
made O
a O

press O
response O
upon O
the O
presentation O
of O
a O
visual O
target O
( O

located O
within O
a O
circle O
) O
. O

Following O
their O
response O
to O
the O
visual O
target O
, O
participants O
received O
feedback O
( O
1.5 O

) O
as O
to O
whether O
they O
were O
successful O
( O
“ O

( O

on O

Following O

, O
there O
was O

end O

period O
( O
3–5 O

) O
before O
the O

Because O
the O
primary O
objective O
of O
ICCAM O
was O
to O
examine O
the O
neural O
correlates O
of O
reward O
anticipation O
, O
we O
chose O
to O
use O
a O
smaller O
number O
of O
loss O
trials O
in O
order O
to O
amplify O
the O
incentive O
salience O
of O
the O
gain O
trials O
during O
the O
task O
. O

Consequently O
, O
there O
was O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
gain O
, O
6 O
lose O
and O
18 O
neutral O
trials O
on O
each O
run O
of O
the O
task O
. O

The O
MID O
task O
was O
tailored O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
visual O
target O
reaction O
time O
of O
each O
participant O
by O
using O
a O
staircase O
algorithm O
, O
such O
that O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
visual O
target O
became O
shorter O
as O
performance O
improved O
during O
the O

. O

This O
enabled O
us O
to O
set O
a O

on O
the O
success O

( O
