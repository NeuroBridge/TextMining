Resting-state O
paradigm O
The O
NIRS O
signals O
were O
acquired O
during O
the O
resting O
state O
as O
previously O
described O
. O

The O
subjects O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
comfortable O
chair O
in O
a O
silent O
room O
to O
achieve O
a O
resting-state O
condition O
. O

They O
were O
instructed O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
central O
fixation O
point O
displayed O
on O
a O
monitor O
during O
the O
NIRS O
measurement O
while O
keeping O
their O
eyes O
open O
and O
remaining O

. O

The O
NIRS O
measurement O
commenced O
when O
the O
subject O
continually O
focused O
on O
the O
fixation O
point O
on O
the O
monitor O
for O
3 O
min O
while O
at O
rest O
. O

The O
resting O
paradigm O
was O
of O
relatively O
short O
duration O
, O
thus O
enabling O
patients O
to O
continue O
following O
the O
instructions O
without O

Relative O
changes O

the O

Then O
, O
the O
square O

was O
calculated O
at O
each O
frequency O
of O
the O

The O
ALFF O
was O
calculated O
as O
the O
sum O
of O
the O
square O
root O
across O
the O
low-frequency O
range O
( O
0.01–0.08 O

) O
, O
and O
the O
value O
of O
the O
ALFF O
was O
divided O
by O
the O
square O
root O
across O
the O
total O
frequency O
range O
between O
0 O
and O
0.25 O

to O
calculate O
the O
fALFF O
. O
