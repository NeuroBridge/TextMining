Subsequently O

we O

By O
calculating O
the O

the O

we O

In O
each O

we O
trained O
a O
SVM O

the O

SVM O

For O
the O
multi-class O

problem O
, O
the O
one-against-all O
strategy O
that O
is O
often O
better O

was O
used O
since O
the O
SVM O
was O
originally O
designed O
for O
two-class O
problem O

A O
linear O

utilized O
in O
SVM O

In O
theory O
, O
non-linear O

may O
work O
better O

linear O

in O
solving O

, O
but O
in O
practice O
many O
researchers O
in O
the O

prefer O
linear O

due O
to O
that O

Based O
on O
the O
well-trained O

we O
examined O
its O

the O

Finally O
, O
we O

the O

The O

The O

reported O
the O

to O
the O

The O

defined O

the O

a O

divided O

the O
total O

The O

the O

Additionally O
, O
we O
also O
computed O
the O

Since O
100 O

then O
shown O

Next O
, O
we O

a O

the O

The O

then O

Furthermore O
, O
we O

displayed O
the O

We O
