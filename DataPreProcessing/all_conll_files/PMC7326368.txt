Because O

we O

We O
planned O

covariates O
in O
all O
analyses O
given O
that O
the O
literature O

an O

Based O

we O
were O
particularly O
interested O
in O
testing O
the O
association O
between O
DRD2 O

and O
the O
ECN O
. O

To O
start O
, O
we O
tested O
the O
relationship O
between O
DRD2 O
methylation O
and O
both O
the O
average O
connectivity O
within O
the O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
. O

We O
then O
chose O
four O
additional O
networks O
to O
test O
individually O
in O
GLMs O
, O
where O
we O
tested O
the O
association O
between O
DRD2 O
methylation O
and O
network O
connectivity O
for O
each O
of O
the O
four O
networks O
, O
controlling O
for O
age O
and O

covariates O
. O

The O
additional O
networks O
tested O
included O
DMN O
, O
AS O
, O
PS O
, O
and O
VDMN O
. O

These O
four O
additional O
networks O
served O
as O
comparison O
networks O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
association O
between O
DRD2 O
methylation O
and O
connectivity O
was O
unique O
to O
the O
ECN O
in O
this O
sample O
of O
substance O
users O
. O

As O
the O
ECN O
was O
the O
primary O
focus O
of O
our O
analyses O
, O
we O
tested O
the O
association O
between O
DRD2 O
methylation O
and O
“ O
edges O
” O
( O
ie O
, O
connectivity O
between O
individual O
nodes O
within O
the O
LECN O
and O
RECN O
) O
. O

Using O
a O
series O
of O
GLMs O
, O
we O
tested O
the O
relationship O
between O
DRD2 O
methylation O
and O
edge O
connectivity O
for O
each O
of O
the O
15 O
edges O
within O
the O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
. O

We O
conducted O
these O
post O

GLMs O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
determining O
which O
edges O
within O
the O
networks O
were O
driving O
the O
association O
between O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
connectivity O
and O
DRD2 O
methylation O
. O

Based O
on O
these O
GLMs O
, O
edges O
were O
selected O
based O
on O
a O
test O
statistic O
threshold O
of O
P O
< O
0.05 O
for O
the O
correlation O
between O
edge O
connectivity O
and O
DRD2 O

. O

Subsequently O
, O
the O
edges O
that O
demonstrated O
a O
significant O
association O
between O
methylation O
and O
edge O
connectivity O
were O
used O
in O
mediation O
and O

models O
. O

Based O
on O
these O
criteria O
, O
the O

the O

the O
most O

and O
the O
3 O
and O
only O
significant O
edges O
within O
the O
LECN O
were O
included O
in O
follow-up O
models O
, O
where O

of O
these O

were O
tested O
as O

between O

( O

Per O
our O

were O
executed O
using O

We O

DRD2 O

within O
the O

of O
the O

between O

and O
our O
clinical O

, O
AUDIT O

This O
was O
tested O
using O
a O

where O
the O

used O
as O
the O

used O

In O
the O
event O
that O
the O
mediation O

was O
not O
supported O
, O
we O
planned O
to O
follow O
up O
the O
mediation O
analyses O
by O
testing O
a O
series O
of O
exploratory O

models O
. O

These O
models O
tested O
whether O

moderated O
the O

between O
DRD2 O

and O
AUDIT O
, O
again O
using O
R O
version O
3.2.1 O
( O
2015-06-18 O
) O
for O
the O
interaction O
model O
GLMs O
. O

For O
these O
models O
, O
we O
planned O
to O
test O
the O
interaction O
between O
each O
of O
the O
edges O
within O
the O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
that O
demonstrated O
a O
significant O
relationship O
between O
DRD2 O
methylation O
edge O
connectivity O
and O
DRD2 O
methylation O
on O
AUDIT O
( O
for O
each O
edge O
within O
the O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
, O
AUDIT O
score O
was O
regressed O
on O

, O
DRD2 O

, O
and O
the O

* O
DRD2 O
methylation O
interaction O
) O
, O
using O
separate O
models O
for O
each O
edge O
within O
the O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
) O
. O

Given O
that O
the O
study O
tests O
multiple O
models O
, O
we O
conceptualize O
the O
issue O
of O
multiple O
comparisons O
as O
follows O
. O

We O
consider O
the O
two O
models O
in O
which O
we O
test O
the O
relationship O
between O
DRD2 O
methylation O
and O
average O
RECN/LECN O
to O
be O
the O
primary O
models O
. O

Given O
that O
we O
used O
the O
other O
networks O
( O
ie O
, O
DMN O
, O
PS O
, O
and O
AS O
) O
as O
control O
networks O
, O
we O
used O
an O
uncorrected O
P O
< O
0.05 O
significance O
threshold O
for O
the O
primary O
models O
. O

Next O
, O
we O
consider O
the O
follow O
up O
analysis O
of O
individual O
edges O
within O
both O
the O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
as O
a O
way O
of O
determining O
which O
edges O
within O
the O
overall O
networks O
are O
driving O
the O
association O
between O
LECN/RECN O
connectivity O
and O
DRD2 O
methylation O
. O

Given O
that O
the O
purpose O
of O
these O
follow O
up O
tests O
is O
to O
determine O
what O
is O
driving O
the O
overall O
effect O
, O
these O
tests O
are O
considered O
significant O
at O
the O
P O
< O
0.05 O
threshold O
. O

This O
logic O
is O
akin O
to O
the O
argument O
made O
by O
Stevens O
regarding O
multivariate O
analyses O
of O
variance O
( O
MANOVAs O
) O
and O
follow O
up O
univariate O
tests O
. O

Briefly O
, O
Stevens O
argues O
that O
if O
the O
overall O
MANOVA O
is O
significant O
, O
then O
the O
individual O
univariate O
tests O
are O
protected O
from O
multiple O
comparisons O
. O

In O
order O
to O
use O
this O
logic O
, O
we O
also O
tested O
the O
relationship O
between O
RECN O
edge O
connectivity O
and O
DRD2 O
methylation O
using O
15 O
degree O
of O
freedom O
MANOVAs O
, O
which O
included O
all O
15 O
RECN O
edges O
and O
all O
15 O
LECN O
edges O
in O
two O
separate O
MANOVA O
models O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
moderation O
and O
mediation O
analyses O
are O
considered O
exploratory O
post O
hoc O
analyses O
and O
are O
therefore O
presented O
as O
uncorrected O
P O
values O
. O
