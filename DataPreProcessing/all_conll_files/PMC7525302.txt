Music O
intervention O
has O
been O
applied O

Although O
the O

could O
be O
increased O
in O

, O
the O

We O
employed O
a O
longitudinal O

measure O
the O
alteration O

undergoing O
Mozart O

listening O
using O

. O

Forty-five O
schizophrenic O

were O
recruited O

to O
two O

Under O
the O
standard O

, O
one O
group O
received O
music O
intervention O
for O
1 O

and O
the O

is O

. O

Both O
schizophrenic O
groups O
were O
compared O
to O
healthy O

Resting-state O
fMRI O
was O
acquired O
from O
schizophrenic O

at O
baseline O

after O
one-month O
music O
intervention O
and O
from O
healthy O

Striatum O

assessed O
through O

After O
music O

, O
increased O

observed O
between O

Increased O

also O
found O

Moreover O

these O

an O
