The O
primary O
advantage O

is O
that O

Using O
the O

seed O
overcomes O
this O
limitation O
, O
but O
, O
by O

Recent O

shown O
that O

can O
induce O
changes O
in O
the O

as O

investigated O
the O

We O
found O
that O

dAMPH-induced O

not O

, O
was O
positively O

in O
this O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
acute O

reduced O

In O

no O

A O

If O

This O

A O

By O

plots O
presented O

are O

of O
1000 O

Monte-Carlo O
simulations O
, O
where O
, O
for O
each O
simulation O
, O
every O
method O
was O
used O
on O
the O
same O
data O
. O

We O
repeated O
this O
simulation O
three O
times O
, O
changing O
only O
the O
distribution O
from O
which O
the O
sources O
, O
s O
[ O
k O
] O
, O
are O
drawn O
. O

In O
the O
first O
case O
, O
we O
consider O
sources O
drawn O
from O
a O
zero O
mean O
Gaussian O
distribution O
, O
which O
aligns O
with O
the O
form O
typically O
used O
in O
all O
derivations O
. O

The O
subsequent O
case O
considers O
sources O
that O
are O
uniformly O
distributed O
with O
zero O
mean O
and O
the O
same O
variance O
as O
the O
previous O
case O
. O

Such O
sub-Gaussian O
or O
platykurtic O
sources O
are O
a O
good O
approximation O
of O
the O
subject O
covariations O
, O
since O
if O
there O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
groups O
then O
the O
distribution O
describing O
the O
subject O
covariations O
will O
be O
bi-modal O
and O
hence O
sub-Gaussian O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
performance O
of O
PCA-CCA O
in O
this O
case O
is O
of O
great O
interest O
. O

The O
final O
case O
considered O
is O
where O
the O
sources O
are O
Laplacian O
distributed O
with O
zero O
mean O
and O
the O
same O
variance O
as O
the O
previous O
distributions O
. O

Due O

the O

to O
provide O
good O

Collectively O

our O

In O
the O

The O
procedure O

by O

of O
ANCOVA O

The O

Only O

kept O
and O
included O
in O
the O

steps O
of O
the O

Then O
, O
we O
aimed O

extract O
a O

so-called O

These O

the O

Then O
, O
we O

At O

wanted O

a O

Thus O
, O
we O
calculate O

i.e O

the O
average O

Then O
we O
performed O
an O

which O
was O
corrected O

Schizophrenia O
Background O
The O
neural O
correlates O
of O

( O
WM O
) O
impairment O
in O
schizophrenia O
remain O
a O
key O
puzzle O
in O
understanding O
the O
cognitive O
deficits O
and O
dysfunction O
of O
dorsolateral O
prefrontal O
cortex O
observed O
in O
the O
disorder O
. O

We O
sought O
to O
determine O
whether O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
exhibit O
an O
alteration O
in O
the O
inverted-U O
relationship O
between O
WM O
load O
and O
activation O
that O
we O
recently O
observed O
in O
healthy O
individuals O
, O
and O
whether O
this O
could O
account O
for O
WM O
deficits O
in O
this O
population O
. O

Methods O
Medicated O
( O
N=30 O
) O
and O
unmedicated O
( O
N=21 O
) O
patients O
with O

and O
healthy O

( O
N=45 O
) O
performed O
the O
self-ordered O
WM O
task O
during O
functional O
Magnetic O

. O

We O
identified O
regions O
exhibiting O
an O
altered O
fit O
to O
an O
inverted-U O
relationship O
between O
WM O
load O
and O
activation O
that O
were O
also O
predictive O
of O
WM O
performance O
. O

Results O
A O
blunted O
inverted-U O
response O
was O
observed O
in O
left O
DLPFC O
in O
patients O
and O
was O
associated O
with O
behavioral O
deficits O
in O
WM O
capacity O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
suppression O
of O
medial O
prefrontal O
cortex O
( O
mPFC O
) O
during O
WM O
was O
reduced O
in O
patients O
, O
and O
was O
also O
associated O
with O
poorer O
WM O
capacity O
in O
patients O
. O

Finally O
, O
activation O
of O
visual O
cortex O
in O
the O
cuneus O
was O
elevated O
in O
patients O
and O
associated O
with O
improved O
WM O
capacity O
. O

Together O
, O
these O
findings O
explained O
55 O
% O
of O
the O
interindividual O
variance O
in O
WM O
capacity O
when O
combined O
with O
diagnostic O
and O
medication O
status O
, O
which O
alone O
accounted O
for O
only O
22 O
% O
of O
the O
variance O
in O
WM O
capacity O
. O

Conclusions O
These O
findings O
identify O
a O
novel O
biomarker O
and O
putative O
mechanism O
of O
WM O
deficits O
in O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
, O

Briefly O
, O
eight O
line-drawings O
of O
difficult-to-verbalize O
objects O
were O
presented O
, O
and O
participants O
were O
instructed O
to O
select O
each O
object O
once O
, O
in O
any O
order O
. O

After O
each O
object O
was O
selected O
, O
all O
objects O
were O
pseudo-randomly O
rearranged O
on O
the O
screen O
. O

Participants O
then O
had O
to O
select O
an O
object O
not O
already O
selected O
, O
so O
that O
at O
each O
step O
there O
was O
one O
more O
previously-selected O
object O
to O
remember O
. O

A O
perceptual O
and O
motor O
control O
task O
was O
used O
following O
identical O
procedures O
, O
except O
that O
one O
object O
was O
marked O
with O
an O
asterisk O
and O
participants O
were O
instructed O
to O
simply O
select O
the O
marked O
object O
. O

Participants O
were O
paid O
$ O
0.25 O

Two O

First O
, O
the O

) O
was O
calculated O
at O
each O
voxel O
for O

participant O
. O

This O
fit O
was O
obtained O
by O
regressing O

task O
activation O
at O
each O
step O
on O
the O
inverted-U O
shape O
, O
such O
that O
larger O
positive O
values O
indicate O
better O
fit O
. O

Second O
, O
a O
task O
- O
control O
contrast O
was O
calculated O
as O
the O
average O
activation O
across O
the O
first O
seven O
steps O
of O
the O
SOT O
minus O
activation O
to O
the O
control O
task O
. O

Although O
we O
did O
not O
hypothesize O
a O
between-group O
difference O
in O
this O
contrast O
, O
it O
is O
a O
commonly O

of O
them O
( O

the O
intention-to-treat O
principle O

Intervention O
During O
the O
baseline O
assessment O
, O
participants O
also O
perform O
a O
computer-based O
rating O
task O
, O
in O
which O
they O
are O
presented O
with O
a O
total O
of O
100 O
pictures O
showing O
different O
categories O
of O
alcoholic O
beverages O
( O
wine O
, O
beer O
, O
spirits O
, O
etc O
. O
) O

and O
pub O
scenes O
and O
100 O
pictures O
illustrating O
alternative O
, O
healthy O
goals O
( O
positive O
personal O
relationships O
, O
health O
and O
fitness O
, O
employment O
and O
career O
, O
further O
education/self-improvement O
, O
and O
personal O
finances O
) O
. O

For O
each O
alcohol-related O
picture O
, O
participants O
are O
asked O
to O
indicate O
( O
by O
using O
the O
mouse O
to O
move O
the O
cursor O
along O
a O
visual O
analogue O
scale O
on O
the O
screen O
) O
how O
much O
this O
specific O
picture O
makes O
them O
want O
a O
drink O
of O
alcohol O
; O
response O
options O
range O
from O
not O
at O
all O
to O
very O
strongly O
. O

Using O
the O
same O
response O
modalities O
, O
participants O
rate O
each O
of O
the O
pictures O
related O
to O
an O
alternative O
goal O
with O
regard O
to O
how O
much O
it O
reminds O
them O
of O
a O
positive O
goal O
that O
they O
are O
currently O
pursuing O
. O

For O
each O
of O
the O
subsequent O
NFT O
sessions O
in O
which O
alcohol-related O
pictures O
are O
down-regulated O
or O
alternative O
goal-related O
pictures O
are O
up-regulated O
, O
the O
pictures O
are O
randomly O
selected O
from O
the O
14 O
pictures O
in O
each O
category O
that O
the O
participant O
rated O
most O
highly O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
stimulus O
sets O
are O
tailored O
to O
each O
participant O
’ O
s O
specific O
drinking O
preferences O
and O
hierarchy O
of O
alternative O
goals O
. O

The O
NFT O
involves O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
( O
MRI O
) O
during O
which O
patients O
lie O
on O
a O
movable O
bed O
inside O
the O
bore O
of O
an O
MRI O
scanner O
. O

Before O
entering O
the O
MRI O
suite O
, O
patients O
undergo O
a O
detailed O
MRI O
safety O
screening O
( O
as O
described O
earlier O
) O
, O
including O
a O
determination O
of O
potential O
safety O
hazards O
( O
see O
exclusion O
criteria O
) O
and O
the O
removal O
of O
all O
metal O
objects O
, O
such O
as O
keys O
or O
jewellery O
, O
from O
their O
body O
. O

While O
in O
the O
scanner O
, O
participants O
in O
the O
experimental O
group O
are O
again O
exposed O
to O
alcohol-related O
stimuli O
, O
such O
as O
pictures O
of O
alcoholic O
drinks O
, O
and O
they O
are O
trained O
to O
regulate O
their O
responses O
in O
specific O
brain O
regions O
that O
are O
activated O
by O
the O
stimuli O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
participants O
are O
exposed O
to O
pictures O
showing O
alternative O
, O
socially O
desirable O
goals O
, O
such O
as O
family/relationships O
or O
employment O
. O

The O
rationale O
for O
including O
the O
two O
categories O
of O
stimuli O
is O
that O
we O
earlier O
demonstrated O
at O
a O
neural O
level O
that O
heavy O
drinking O
is O
associated O
with O
overvaluation O
of O
alcohol O
and O
undervaluation O
of O
alternative O
, O
socially O
desirable O
goals O
. O

Moreover O
, O
consistent O
with O
motivational O
theory O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
problem O
drinkers O
’ O
success O
in O
reducing O
their O
drinking O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
they O
have O
other O
satisfying O
alternative O
goals O
to O
pursue O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
size O
of O
the O
images O
that O
participants O
see O
corresponds O
to O
the O
level O
of O
activation O
. O

They O
are O
told O
to O
use O
any O
kind O
of O
mental O
strategy O
at O
their O
disposal O
( O
e.g O
. O

thinking O
about O
the O
negative O
consequences O
of O
drinking O
) O
that O
helps O
to O
reduce O
size O
of O
the O
image O
( O
in O
the O
case O
of O
alcohol O
pictures O
) O
or O
increase O
size O
of O
the O
image O
and O
thereby O
the O
degree O
of O
brain O
activation O
( O
in O
the O
case O
of O
healthy O
, O
goal-related O
pictures O
) O
. O

The O
Cognitive O
Pragmatic O
Treatment O
The O
patient O
took O
part O
in O
the O
CPT O
, O
and O
he O
underwent O
the O
fMRI O
scanning O
before O
and O
after O
treatment O
. O

The O
CPT O
lasted O
10 O
weeks O
and O
it O
was O
structured O
in O
two O
sessions O
per O
week O
, O
each O
one O
lasting O
90 O
minutes O
. O

Patients O
attended O
the O
sessions O
in O
small O
groups O
of O
five/six O
, O
led O
by O
a O
psychologist O
. O

The O
treatment O
mainly O
concentrated O
on O
the O
different O
expressive O
modalities O
of O
communication O
, O
that O
is O
, O
linguistic O
, O
extralinguistic O
, O
paralinguistic O
, O
social O
appropriateness O
, O
and O
conversational O
abilities O
. O

Moreover O
, O
other O
sessions O
were O
focused O
on O
aspects O
such O
as O
awareness O
, O
theory O
of O
mind O
, O
and O
planning O
, O
which O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
a O
role O
to O
play O
in O
communicative O
performance O
. O

The O
training O
provided O
the O
patients O
with O
an O
ecological O
setting O
where O
they O
were O
encouraged O
to O
exercise O
their O
communicative O
abilities O
and O
learn O
how O
to O
face O
typical O
situations O
of O
everyday O
interactions O
; O
this O
goal O
was O
realized O
through O
self-monitoring O
strategies O
and O
feedback O
provided O
by O
the O
therapist O
. O

Communicative-pragmatic O
difficulties O
displayed O
by O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
are O
related O
to O
their O
difficulties O
in O
filling O
the O
gap O
between O
what O
is O
literally O
said O
and O
what O
is O
meant O
, O
as O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
indirect O
speech O
acts O
and O
figurative O
language O
( O
e.g. O
, O
) O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
many O
activities O
along O
the O
training O
were O
focused O
on O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
partner O
's O
intended O
meaning O
starting O
from O
the O
expressed O
literal O
message O
. O

Specific O
attention O
was O
also O
given O
to O
the O
ability O
to O
interpret O
and O
use O
nonverbal O
and O
paralinguistic O
cues O
, O
such O
as O
facial O
expression O
and O
the O
tone O
of O
voice O
, O
in O
order O
to O
identify O
the O
correct O
speaker O
's O
communicative O
intention O
; O
irony O
, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
characterized O
by O
specific O
paralinguistic O
cues O
that O
help O
a O
person O
to O
distinguish O
it O
from O
deceit O
. O

Moreover O
, O
frequently O
these O
patients O
have O
difficulty O
in O
modulating O
their O
speech O
according O
to O
the O
contextual O
information O
. O

This O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
many O
activities O
of O
the O
training O
were O
focused O
on O
the O
ability O
to O
decode O
violations O
of O
the O
conversational O
implicatures O
and O
to O
avoid O
digressions O
and O
derailments O

Behavioural O
Measures O
The O
communicative-pragmatic O
abilities O
of O
the O
patient O
were O
measured O
through O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
equivalent O
forms O
of O
ABaCo O
before O
and O
after O
treatment O
. O

The O
equivalent O
forms O
of O
the O
ABaCo O
have O
shown O
a O
good O
internal O
consistency O
, O
a O
good O
correlation O
between O

the O

This O

The O

PT O

It O
is O
important O
to O
choose O
an O
appropriate O
P-threshold O
to O
define O
PGRS O
and O
methods O
are O
proposed O
to O
choose O
the O
threshold O
. O

However O
, O
since O
this O
is O
a O
data O
driven O
study O
without O
predefined O
phenotypes O
, O
this O
method O
could O
not O
work O
on O
our O
study O
. O

A O
more O
stringent O
threshold O
generates O
a O
SNP O
set O
with O
less O
SNPs O
being O
truly O
associated O
with O
the O
disorders O
. O

With O
a O
more O
liberal O
threshold O
, O
more O
SNPs O
will O
be O
included O
, O
which O
will O
help O
increase O
the O
statistical O
power O
. O

But O
too O
liberal O
threshold O
will O
include O
SNPs O
that O
are O
too O
weakly O
associated O
with O
the O
disorders O
. O

So O
the O
statistical O
power O
will O
decrease O
. O

Among O
these O
four O
thresholds O
, O
PT O
< O
0.05 O
could O
be O
a O
balance O
of O
statistical O
power O
and O
the O
number O
of O
SNPs O
. O

So O
our O
research O
was O
primarily O
based O
on O
the O
PGRS O
calculated O
at O
PT O
< O
0.05 O
, O
and O
we O
analyzed O
PGRS O
at O
other O
thresholds O
based O
on O
the O
results O
of O
PT O
< O
0.05 O
. O

We O
calculated O
the O
PGRS O
using O
the O
method O
described O
in O
a O
previous O
paper O

First O
we O
calculated O
the O
cross-disorder O

then O
calculated O

EEG O
Task O
Stimuli O
The O
stimuli O
consisted O
of O
80 O
story O
sets O
. O

A O
set O
was O
comprised O
of O
two O
conditions O
of O
the O
same O
story O
: O
Animate O
and O
Inanimate O
. O

Stories O
were O
translated O
from O
Dutch O
to O
English O
and O
adapted O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
current O
study O
from O
those O
used O
in O
. O

Each O
story O
contained O
4 O
sentences O
. O

For O
all O
stories O
, O
an O
inanimate O
, O
cartoon-like O
character O
was O
introduced O
in O
the O
first O
sentence O
( O
e.g O
. O

a O
peanut O
that O
is O
described O
as O
happy O
and O
smiling O
) O
. O

The O
passages O
were O
written O
so O
that O
each O
sentence O
reinforced O
that O
the O
normally O
inanimate O
object O
( O
e.g. O
, O
the O
peanut O
) O
served O
as O
an O
animate O
character O
in O
this O
context O
. O

This O
was O
accomplished O
by O
references O
in O
the O
first O
three O
sentences O
to O
the O
character O
using O
pronouns O
reserved O
for O
animate O
characters O
( O
he/she O
) O
, O
and O
by O
the O
use O
of O

e.g O
. O

the O
peanut O
had O
a O
big O
smile… O
; O
the O
peanut O
was O
amazed… O
) O
. O

Then O
, O
in O
sentence O
4 O
, O
the O
character O
was O
described O
using O
a O
critical O
word O
that O
requires O
an O
animate O
or O
inanimate O
object O
to O
fill O
one O
of O
its O
thematic O
roles O
. O

This O
critical O
word O
was O
therefore O
consistent O
with O
either O
the O
immediately O
preceding O
context O
( O
cartoon-style O
context-Animate O
critical O
word O
) O
, O
or O
inconsistent O
( O
cartoon-style O
context-Inanimate O
critical O
word O
) O
. O

Inanimate O
critical O
words O
were O
chosen O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
the O
most O
typical O
, O
non-cartoon-style O
meaning O
of O
the O
inanimate O
objects O
that O
served O
as O
the O
animate O
character O
. O

to O

To O
accomplish O
this O
, O
we O
used O
a O

according O
to O
their O
putative O
functionality O
via O
a O

, O
a O

is O
that O
it O
requires O

Nonetheless O
, O
we O
considered O
this O

In O

” O

Conversely O
, O
the O
absence O
of O
an O

represents O
the O

of O
a O

( O

) O
between O

In O
order O

construct O
such O
graphs O
, O
cost-based O
thresholding O
is O
performed O
in O
which O
an O
edge O

only O
placed O
between O

stronger O

the O
threshold O
( O
e.g O
. O

the O

of O

) O
. O

The O
procedure O
is O
termed O
“ O
cost O
” O
based O
thresholding O
because O
as O

This O

used O
because O

Interhemispheric O

analysis O
We O
used O
interhemispheric O
correlations O
to O
demonstrate O
the O
long-range O
connectivity O
of O
the O
right O
and O
left O
lateral O
OFC O
( O

All O

The O
typical O
patterns O
observed O
in O
the O
cortical O
blood O
flow O
during O
brain O
activation O
are O
an O
increase O
in O
HbO O
and O
a O
decrease O
in O
Hb O
. O

As O
the O
regions O
covered O
by O
the O
channels O
were O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other O
anatomically O
, O
we O
assume O
that O
the O
long-range O
activation O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
the O
connectivity O
because O
the O
interhemispheric O
correlations O

is O
designed O
to O
study O
a O
long-distance O

that O
is O
likely O
connected O
to O
the O
intravascular O
( O

Therefore O

whole-brain O
correlation O
analyses O
To O
analyze O
the O
rsFC O
of O
the O
HDs O
and O
CGs O
, O
we O
used O
two O
approaches O
: O
( O
1 O
) O
a O
seed-based O
correlation O
analysis O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
a O
whole-brain O
correlation O
analysis O
. O

The O
former O
approach O
was O
used O
in O
order O
to O
estimate O
and O
detect O
the O
strength O
of O
pairwise O
relationships O
between O
a O
predefined O
seed O
channel O
and O
other O
channels O
covering O
other O
OFC O
regions O
. O

This O
allowed O
us O
to O
identify O
intrinsic O
functional O
connectivity O
in O
different O
OFC O
region O
systems O
. O

The O
second O
approach O
aimed O
to O
compute O
a O
functional O

map O
between O
any O
two O
channel O
pairs O
in O
the O
entire O
OFC O
system O

where O
the O
measurement O

represented O
nodes O
, O
and O
the O
functional O
connections O
with O
correlation O
coefficients O
greater O
than O
a O
predefined O
threshold O
were O
considered O
edges O
. O

The O
change O
in O
HbO O
concentration O
is O
recognized O
to O
be O
the O
most O
responsive O
indicator O
of O
differences O
in O
cortical O
blood O
flow O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
HbO O
signals O
would O
be O
responsive O
enough O
to O
indicate O
changes O
in O
the O
local O
activity O
in O
the O
regions O

by O
the O
channels O
that O
were O
not O
far O
apart O
from O
each O
other O
as O
abovementioned O
. O

For O
simplicity O
, O
HbO O
was O
therefore O
considered O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
analyses O

The O
Hb O

. O

The O
run O
averages O

the O

were O
first O
calculated O
for O
each O

and O
then O
grand O

A O

The O

The O
global O

used O
included O
small-world O
parameters O
, O
local O

In O
the O

, O
( O

were O

with O
the O

small-world O
parameters O
between O
the O
brain O
networks O
of O
both O
HDs O

These O
global O
network O
metrics O
provided O
a O
global O
topological O
framework O
of O
the O
whole-brain O
network O
, O
taking O
into O
account O
all-channel O

in O

In O
the O
nodal O

, O
the O
nodal O
degree O

of O
each O

was O
examined O
. O

These O
nodal O
metrics O
provided O
information O
on O
the O
regional O

of O
the O
functional O
brain O

. O

Traditionally O
, O
a O
small-world O

is O
one O
where O
the O
clustering O
coefficient O
of O
a O

network O
is O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
a O

network O
and O
where O
the O
path-length O
is O
characteristically O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
a O
random O
graph O
. O

Thus O
, O
normalization O
of O
clustering O
coefficients O
and O
path-length O
are O
traditionally O
computed O
with O
respect O
to O
random O

However O
, O
it O

to O
compare O

. O

Intuitively O
, O
in O
addition O

this O

, O
we O
wanted O
to O
explore O
whether O
the O

“ O

thus O

Background O
Alcohol O
use O

occur O
commonly O
in O
the O
community O
. O

Even O
though O
this O
high-prevalence O
comorbidity O
is O
associated O
with O
poorer O
posttreatment O
outcomes O
and O
greater O
utilization O
of O

services O
, O
existing O
treatment O
trials O
often O
exclude O
patients O
with O
comorbid O
depressive O
and O
alcohol O
use O
disorders O
. O

Past O
research O
suggests O
that O
symptoms O
such O
as O
craving O
and O
anhedonia O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
alterations O
within O
the O
reward O
circuit O
, O
while O
emotion O
regulation O
deficits O
are O
related O
to O
disruptions O
within O
the O
default O
mode O
network O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
clinical O
neuroimaging O
study O
is O
to O
transfer O
previous O
research O
about O
the O
reward O
circuit O
and O
default O

underlying O
alcohol O
use O
disorder O
and O

to O
achieve O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
neural O

characterizing O
their O
comorbidity O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
neurobiological O
results O
will O
be O
used O
to O
test O
whether O
two O
psychotherapeutic O

are O
able O

Thereby O
, O
we O
plan O

whether O
these O

programs O
are O
able O
to O
positively O

Discussion O
The O
objective O
of O
the O
project O
is O
to O
identify O
common O
and/or O
distinct O
neural O
signatures O
underlying O
the O
comorbidity O
of O
alcohol O

and O
depression O
. O

If O
the O
neurobiological O
understanding O
of O
alcohol O
addiction O
and O
depression O
is O
improved O
, O
this O
could O
potentially O
serve O
as O
a O
key O
predictor O
of O
treatment O
response O
to O
specific O
types O
of O
behavioral O
or O
mindfulness O
therapies O
hypothesized O
to O
alter O

The O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
neurobiological O
underpinnings O
is O
to O
develop O
preventive O
and O
more O
effective O

strategies O
. O

Compared O
to O
antidepressant O
or O

medication O
, O
less O
research O
has O
examined O
functional O

responses O

Available O

suggest O
that O
psychotherapy O
predicts O
metabolic O
changes O
in O
reward O
, O
cingulate O
and O
frontal O
cortices O
in O
alcohol O

and O

. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
only O
a O
few O
studies O
evaluated O
the O
effects O
of O
a O
specific O
psychotherapeutic O
intervention O
like O
the O
brief O
Behavioral O
Activation O
Treatment O
( O
BAT O
) O
for O

on O

Dichter O
and O

report O
functional O
changes O
in O
reward O
associated O
structures O
including O
the O
dorsal O
striatum O
during O
reward O
anticipation O
after O
a O
BAT O
intervention O
but O
did O
not O
include O
a O
depressed O
control O
group O
. O

Looking O
on O
the O
DMN O
connectivity O
, O
Crowther O
and O
colleagues O
found O
that O
the O
response O
to O
BAT O
in O
depressed O
patients O
was O
predicted O
by O
pretreatment O
connectivity O
of O
the O
right O
insula O
with O
the O
right O
middle O
temporal O
gyrus O
and O
the O
left O
intraparietal O
sulcus O
. O

Another O
psychotherapeutic O
intervention O
with O
potential O
effects O
on O
resting O
state O
networks O
is O
mindfulness O
based O
therapy O
( O
MBT O
) O
. O

MBT O
is O
a O
meditation O
practice O
that O
is O
recently O
receiving O
growing O
attention O
for O
its O
potential O
clinical O
applications O
in O
the O
context O
of O
alcohol O
dependence O
and O
depression O
. O

Neuroimaging O
studies O
showed O
that O
long-term O
meditators O
showed O
increased O
activation O
of O
prefrontal O
areas O
during O
meditation O
as O
compared O
with O
a O
rest O
condition O
or O
with O
matched O
control O
subjects O
naïve O
to O

. O

In O
summary O
, O
dysfunctions O
in O
the O
reward O
circuit O
, O
as O
well O
as O
DMN O
have O
been O
identified O
as O
key O
domains O
underlying O
alcohol O
dependence O
and O
depression O
. O

We O
assume O
that O
these O
mechanisms O
also O
characterize O
the O
neurobiological O
underpinning O
of O
their O
comorbidity O
. O

Thereby O
, O
the O
identification O
of O
neural O
risk O
factors O
associated O
with O
their O
co-occurrence O
might O
help O
in O
understanding O
the O
pathophysiological O
mechanisms O
leading O
to O
their O
onset O
and O
course O
. O

The O
overall O
goal O
of O
improving O
our O
understanding O
of O
neurobiological O
mechanisms O
is O
to O
improve O
treatment O
. O

If O
the O
neurobiological O
understanding O
of O
alcohol O
dependence O
and O
depression O
is O
improved O
, O
this O
could O
potentially O
serve O

has O
been O
successfully O
implemented O
in O

studies O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
will O
use O

version O
of O
the O
paradigm O
in O

The O
paradigm O
consists O
of O
five O

, O
participants O
are O
told O
to O
keep O
their O

Correspondingly O
, O
in O
the O
behavioral O
activation O
training O
phase O
, O
participants O
are O
played O
audio O
instructions O
associated O
with O
imagining O
activities O
while O
viewing O
alcohol-associated O
pictures O
. O

In O
each O
phase O
, O
9 O
alcohol-associated O
cues O
are O
presented O
for O
15 O

, O
while O
simultaneously O
9 O
audio O
statements O
are O
played O
. O

After O
each O
picture O
a O
fixation O
cross O
is O
presented O
for O
also O
15 O
s. O
After O
each O
block O
, O
participants O
are O
instructed O
to O
rate O
their O
mood O
by O
means O
of O
the O
Positive O
and O
Negative O

For O
the O

As O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
mindfulness-based O

In O
the O
present O

we O
propose O
to O
associate O
both O
the O
regression O
and O
CCA O
frameworks O
in O
the O
case O
of O

Our O
motivation O
is O
to O
extract O
informative O
features O
that O
also O
display O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
correlation O
across O
modalities O
. O

A O
simple O
way O
to O
combine O
Lasso O
and O
sparse O
CCA O
would O
be O
a O
weighted O
combination O
of O
Eq O
. O

( O

) O
and O
Eq O
. O

( O

) O
: O
where O
γ O
∈ O
[ O
0 O
, O

] O
is O
a O
weight O

. O

Notice O
that O
Eq O

( O

) O
can O
be O
expressed O
within O
the O
collaborative O
framework O
introduced O
in O
Section O
2.2 O
. O

If O
we O
take O
a O
look O
at O
Eq O

( O

) O
with O
M O
= O
2 O
, O
U1 O
= O
X1 O
and O
U2 O
= O
X2 O
, O
we O
fall O
back O
on O
Eq O
. O
( O

) O
. O

Let O
us O
call O
this O
model O
CoReg O
for O
Collaborative O
Regression O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
a O
similar O
model O
has O
been O
considered O
before O
by O
Gross O
to O
perform O
prediction O
using O
breast O

data O
. O

However O
, O
to O
our O
opinion O
, O
such O
formulation O
might O
prove O
to O
be O
too O
constraining O
. O

It O
essentially O
amounts O
to O
force O
each O
component O
of O
the O
βm O
’ O
s O
to O
fit O
both O
the O
regression O

and O
the O
CCA O
one O
. O

We O
illustrate O
such O
behaviour O
using O
a O
toy O
dataset O
later O
in O
Section O
3.4 O
. O

Since O
our O
goal O
is O
to O
perform O
feature O
selection O
, O
we O
may O
allow O
the O
model O
to O
be O
slightly O
more O
flexible O
. O

We O
thus O
propose O
an O
alternative O
formulation O
by O
first O
duplicating O
each O
βm O
into O
two O
components O
such O
that O
: O
where O

are O

As O
a O

are O
now O
matrices O
such O
that O
βm O
∈ O
ℝpm×2 O
∀m O
= O
1 O
, O

. O

We O
then O
propose O
the O
following O
MT-CoReg O
formulation O
: O
where O
is O

of O

is O
simply O
the O
ℓ1/ℓ2 O
norm O
of O

As O
we O
can O
observe O

are O
the O

the O

: O
unsurprisingly O
, O
Lasso O

produce O

while O

that O

we O

We O

In O

we O
constructed O

The O

An O

Since O

Once O

There O
are O
three O
improvements O
when O
using O

Firstly O
, O
from O
the O
results O
, O
we O
can O
see O
when O
using O
the O

method O
with O
weighted O
betweenness O
that O
there O
exist O
some O

that O
have O
the O

While O
in O
the O
results O
based O
on O
the O
proposed O
method O
every O
region O
has O
different O
value O
of O
importance O
, O
so O
our O
method O
is O
more O
accurate O
for O
evaluating O
the O
importance O
of O
brain O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
clearly O
in O
the O
region O

results O
with O
weighted O
betweenness O
method O
that O
some O
brain O
regions O
have O
the O
same O
importance O
value O
of O
zero O
, O
but O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
a O
region O
to O
have O
no O
importance O
in O
the O

While O
in O
the O
results O
of O
proposed O
method O
even O
the O
last O
one O
also O
has O
a O
no-zero O

value O
, O
so O
our O
method O
is O
more O
reasonable O
for O

the O
importance O

Finally O
in O
the O

results O
with O

method O
, O
the O
distribution O

is O
more O
even O
and O
the O
values O
in O

are O
closed O

While O
in O
the O
results O

the O

sharper O
, O
the O
difference O
between O
the O

in O
the O

is O
more O
apparent O
. O

For O
further O

the O
most O

it O
can O
be O

that O

procedure O
As O
described O
in O

, O
and O
had O
to O
indicate O
the O

on O
the O
change O
in O
DLPFC-amygdala O

Abstract O
Background O
Evidence O
for O
olfactory O
dysfunction O
in O

has O
been O
firmly O
established O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
typical O
understanding O
of O
schizophrenia O
, O
olfaction O
is O
not O
recognized O
to O
contribute O
to O
or O
interact O
with O
the O
illness O
. O

Despite O
the O
solid O
presence O
of O
olfactory O
dysfunction O
in O
schizophrenia O
, O
its O
relation O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
illness O
remains O
largely O
unclear O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
aimed O
to O
examine O
functional O
connectivity O
of O
the O
olfactory O
bulb O
, O
olfactory O
tract O
, O
and O
piriform O
cortices O
and O
isolate O
the O
network O
that O
would O
account O
for O
the O
altered O
olfaction O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

Methods O
We O
examined O
the O
functional O
connectivity O
of O
these O
specific O
olfactory O
regions O
in O
order O
to O
isolate O
other O

regions O
associated O

Results O
The O
schizophrenia O

showed O
disconnectivity O
between O

Estimating O

using O
GIG-ICA O
We O
applied O
GIG-ICA O
to O

data O
of O
all O

to O
estimate O
each O
subject O

, O
resulting O
in O
INs O
with O
correspondence O
across O
subjects O
while O
also O
retaining O
subject-specific O
network O
features O
. O

Our O
method O
primarily O
involved O
the O
following O
three O
steps O
. O

First O
, O
based O
on O
the O
temporally-concatenated O
fMRI O
data O
of O
181 O
subjects O
, O
ICA O
with O
the O
Infomax O
algorithm O
was O
used O
to O
estimate O
the O
group-level O
ICs O
. O

In O
order O
to O
decrease O
the O
influence O
of O
random O
initializations O
, O
we O
performed O
ICASSO O
with O
20 O
ICA O
runs O
followed O
by O
selection O
of O
the O
most O
reliable O
ICA O
run O
to O
obtain O
reliable O
group-level O
ICs O
. O

Before O
the O
group-level O
ICA O
, O
subject-level O
and O
group-level O
PCAs O
were O
applied O
to O
reduce O
the O
dimensionality O
of O
the O
fMRI O
data O
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
the O
number O
of O
ICs O
was O
set O
to O
30 O
based O
on O
previous O
work O
, O
and O
the O
number O
of O
principle O
components O
used O
in O
the O
subject-level O
PCAs O
was O
specified O
as O
a O
greater O
number O
( O
i.e. O
, O
60 O
) O
as O
recommended O
. O

Thus O
, O
30 O
group O
-level O
ICs O
were O
obtained O
and O
Z-scored O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
the O
sign O
of O
each O
resulting O
group-level O
IC O
is O
arbitrary O
. O

In O
our O
study O
, O
we O
computed O
the O
skewness O
of O
each O
IC O
and O
flipped O
the O
IC O
if O
its O
skewness O
was O
negative O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
positive O
Z-scores O
in O
each O
IC O
represented O
the O
voxels O
contributing O
the O
most O
to O
the O
associated O
network O
. O

Second O
, O
we O
manually O
identified O
the O
meaningful O
group-level O
networks O
after O
carefully O
inspecting O
all O
group-level O
ICs O
' O
spatial O
maps O
. O

If O
the O
primary O
activation O
of O
one O
IC O
's O
spatial O
map O
is O
located O
in O
gray O
matter O
, O
smooth O
and O
continuous O
, O
we O
preferred O
to O
regard O
it O
as O
an O
interesting O
functional O
network O
. O

Also O
, O
we O
referred O
to O
networks O
reported O
in O
previous O
studies O
to O
further O
confirm O
. O

The O
removed O
noise-related O
group-level O
ICs O
reflected O
head O
motion O
, O
physiological O
noise O
, O
and O
influence O
of O
scanner O
. O

Third O
, O
the O
remaining O
meaningful O
group-level O
ICs O
were O
characterized O
as O
the O
group-level O
INs O
and O
then O
used O
to O
calculate O
the O
subject-specific O
INs O
based O
on O
a O
multi-objective O
function O
optimization O
algorithm O
. O

GIG-ICA O
automatically O
yields O
Z-scored O
the O
subject-specific O
INs O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
regression O
model O
was O
utilized O
to O
estimate O
the O
corresponding O
time O
courses O
( O
reflecting O
fluctuations O
) O
of O
the O
individual O
INs O
for O
each O
subject O
's O
fMRI O
data O
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
for O
each O
voxel O
in O
a O
given O
individual O
IN O
, O
a O
positive O
Z-score O
indicates O
that O
the O
time O
series O
( O
after O
preprocessing O
) O
in O
the O
voxel O
has O
a O
positive O
correlation O
with O
the O
time O
course O
of O
the O
IN O
; O
in O
contrast O
a O
negative O
Z-score O
represents O
that O
the O
time O
series O
in O
the O
voxel O
has O
a O
negative O
correlation O
with O
the O
time O
course O
of O
the O
IN O
. O

Therefore O
, O
for O
one O
specific O
IN O
, O
a O
region O
containing O
voxels O
with O
high O
positive O
Z-scores O
( O
taking O
a O
region O
only O
including O
two O
voxels O
as O
an O
example O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
10 O
and O
9 O
) O
tends O
to O
have O
stronger O
co-activation O
( O
i.e. O
, O
positive O
correlation O
) O
within O
the O
IN O
compared O
to O
a O
region O
containing O
voxels O
with O
low O
positive O
Z-scores O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
2 O
and O
1 O
) O
. O

In O
such O
case O
, O
the O
mean O
of O
the O
Z-scores O
in O
one O
region O
can O
reflect O
the O
co-activation O
extent O
of O
the O
region O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
if O
a O
region O
contains O
voxels O
with O
greater O
negative O
Z-scores O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
− O
10 O
and O
− O
9 O
) O
relative O
to O
the O
other O
region O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
− O
2 O
and O
− O
1 O
) O
, O
the O
former O
also O
tends O
to O
have O
stronger O
co-activation O
than O
the O
later O
. O

In O
this O
study O
, O
considering O
that O
the O
positive O
Z-scores O
contributing O
the O
most O
include O
important O
spatial O
maps O
in O
each O
IN O
, O
we O
focused O
on O
investigating O
group O
differences O
in O
voxels O
primarily O
associated O
with O
positive O
Z-scores O
to O
simplify O
the O
subsequent O
analyses O
. O

It O
is O
also O
worth O
pointing O
out O
that O
if O
one O
region O
includes O
both O
higher O
and O
lower O
positive O
Z-scores O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
10 O
and O
1 O
) O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
region O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Z-scores O
of O
two O
voxels O
= O
2 O
and O
8 O
) O
, O
we O
can O
not O
determine O
which O
region O
has O
greater O
co-activation O
using O
Z-scores O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
this O
work O
, O
we O
applied O
two-sample O
t-tests O
( O
rather O
than O
analysis O
of O
variance O
) O
to O
identify O
brain O
regions O
including O
voxels O
with O
consistent O
changing O
patterns O
between O
groups O
. O

Identifying O
significant O
discriminative O
regions O
in O
intrinsic O
functional O
networks O
Based O
on O
the O
estimated O
subject-specific O
INs O
, O
we O
investigated O
differences O
in O
each O
corresponding O
IN O
across O
the O
three O
groups O
in O
order O
to O
examine O
the O
network O

of O
the O
ESZ O
and O
CHR O
group O
relative O
to O
each O
other O
and O
to O
the O
HC O
group O
. O

For O
each O
IN O
, O
we O
performed O
three O
analysis O
steps O
that O
include O
( O

) O
extracting O
important O
voxels O
positively O
contributing O
to O
the O
network O
( O
i.e. O
, O

) O
and O

investigating O

. O

We O
describe O
the O
detailed O
processing O
on O
each O
IC O
as O
follows O
. O

In O
the O
first O
step O
, O
for O
each O

, O
a O
right-tailed O

i.e. O
, O

= O

) O
was O
applied O
to O
the O
voxel O

Z-scores O
from O
the O
corresponding O
subject-specific O
INs O
of O
all O
181 O
subjects O
to O
identify O
voxels O
whose O
Z-scores O
were O
positive O
in O
most O
of O
the O
subjects O
, O
resulting O
a O
network O
mask O
. O

The O
subsequent O
second O
and O
third O
steps O
were O
performed O
on O
the O
voxels O
in O
the O
network O

. O

Additionally O
, O
we O
tested O
if O
our O
strategy O
may O
fail O
to O
find O
group O
differences O
in O
some O
important O
voxels O

showing O
positive O

( O
e.g. O

. O

So O
, O
we O
examined O
whether O

one-sample O

may O
generate O
significantly O

Finally O

Regarding O

In O

A O
pilot O

Background O
Individuals O
who O
use O
cocaine O
have O
fewer O
cognitive O
resources O
needed O
to O
maintain O
abstinence O
. O

This O
is O
evidenced O
by O
blunted O
brain O
function O
during O
cognitive O
control O
tasks O
and O
reduced O
communication O
between O
brain O
regions O
associated O
with O
cognitive O
function O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
relapse O
vulnerability O
is O
heightened O
in O
individuals O
with O
less O
communication O
between O
the O
right O
and O
left O
frontoparietal O
executive O
control O
network O
( O
ECN O
) O
. O

Given O
that O
recent O
cocaine O
use O
enhances O
such O
communication O
, O
it O
is O
plausible O
that O
recency O
of O
cocaine O
use O
influences O
interhemispheric O
ECN O
communication O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
ECN O
communication O
weakens O
over O
the O
course O
of O
early O
cocaine O
abstinence O
, O
which O
may O
then O
enhance O
relapse O
risk O
. O

Methods O
In O
ten O
men O
with O
cocaine O
use O
disorder O
, O
we O
conducted O
a O
preliminary O
assessment O
of O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
number O
of O
days O
since O
last O
cocaine O
use O
( O
1–3 O
days O
) O
and O
interhemispheric O
ECN O

( O

. O

Results O
Reduced O
interhemispheric O
ECN O
coupling O
was O
associated O
with O
increasing O
days O
since O
last O
cocaine O
use O
; O
weaker O
coupling O
was O
also O
associated O
with O
lower O
urine O
cocaine O

concentrations O
. O

This O
association O
was O
more O
prominent O
in O
prefrontal O
than O
parietal O
ECN-subregions O
. O

Conclusions O
Preliminary O
results O
indicate O
that O
resting O
state O
interhemispheric O
ECN O
coupling O
weakens O
within O
the O
first O
few O
days O
following O
last O
cocaine O
use O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
known O
link O
between O
reduced O
ECN O
interhemispheric O
coupling O
and O
relapse O
vulnerability O
, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
relapse O
risk O
may O
increase O
the O
longer O
an O
individual O
abstains O
during O
an O
early O

This O

treats O

The O

The O

The O

Using O
FIRMM O
We O
focused O
on O
making O
FIRMM O
as O
easy O
to O
launch O
as O
possible O
to O
minimize O
the O
time O
interval O
between O
subject O
arrival O
and O
starting O
the O
first O
run O
, O
which O
can O
reduce O
costs O
and O
increase O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
through O
the O
entire O
protocol O
for O
longer O
scanning O
sessions O
, O
especially O
in O
special O
populations O
. O

In O
its O
current O
version O
, O
scanner O
operators O
open O
the O
FIRMM O
monitoring O
GUI O
by O
typing O
‘ O
FIRMM O
’ O
into O
the O
command O
line O
. O

To O
start O
monitoring O
head O
movement O
in O
real O
time O
the O
scanner O
operator O
must O
open O
FIRMM O
and O
then O
click O
the O
‘ O
Start O
FIRMM O
’ O
button O
which O
will O
begin O
monitoring O
the O
backend O
JSON O
file O
for O
updates O
. O

Once O
launched O
, O
FIRMM O
requires O
no O
additional O
inputs O
because O
it O
automatically O
detects O
the O
active O
MRI O
scanning O
session O

and O
monitors O
for O
new O
incoming O
EPI O

Should O
the O
scanner O
operator O
forget O
to O
launch O
FIRMM O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
scanning O
session O
, O
he O
or O
she O
can O
launch O
FIRMM O
at O
any O
point O
during O
the O
study O
and O
FIRMM O
will O
process O
all O
EPI O
images O
associated O
with O
the O
current O

in O
the O
correct O
order O
until O
it O
catches O
up O

. O

FIRMM O
automatically O
saves O
a O
log O
file O
for O
each O
run O
during O
a O
scanning O
session O
. O

Shutting O
down O
FIRMM O
only O
requires O
closing O
the O
FIRMM O
GUI O
window O
. O

All O
synced O

are O
automatically O
deleted O
from O

In O
that O

, O
FIRMM O
saves O
the O

FIRMM O
also O

For O
each O

Future O
upgrades O
to O
FIRMM O
As O
noted O
above O
, O
the O
current O
version O
of O
FIRMM O
is O
part O
of O
the O
standard O
acquisition O
protocol O
for O
the O
21-site O
ABCD O
study O
that O
will O
collect O
MRI O
data O
( O
structural O
, O

fMRI O
, O
and O
rs-fcMRI O
) O
from O
10,000 O
children O
biannually O
over O
the O
span O
of O
10 O
years O
, O
starting O
at O
the O
age O
of O
9 O
. O

We O
expect O
the O
ABCD O
study O
to O
provide O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
valuable O
feedback O
to O
further O
improve O
FIRMM O
’ O

data O
should O
allow O
us O

improve O
the O

of O
our O

in O
the O
age O

FIRMM O
upgrades O
already O
under O
development O
are O
aimed O
at O
making O
it O
even O
easier O
to O
use O
and O
to O
broaden O
its O
capabilities O
. O

Hence O
, O
we O
are O
currently O
testing O
a O
version O
of O
FIRMM O
with O
interactive O
graphics O
that O
would O
further O
simplify O
its O
use O
by O
allowing O
the O

of O

for O
inclusion O
in O
the O
actual O

of O

Planned O
future O

should O
also O
allow O

to O
display O
DVAR O
( O

) O
as O
an O
additional O
EPI O

. O

DVAR O
measures O
how O
much O
the O
whole O

intensity O
varies O
from O
each O

to O
the O
next O
, O
independent O

change O
. O

DVAR O
traces O
are O
very O
sensitive O
to O
frame-to-frame O

but O
in O
principle O
can O
also O
detect O
EPI O

aberrancies O
from O

. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
4dfp O

algorithm O
currently O
implemented O
by O
FIRMM O
, O
future O

the O

SVM O
has O

very O
high-dimensional O

the O
rationale O

the O
inter-relationship O

conceptually O

the O
idea O
that O

Abstract O
Naltrexone O
, O
an O
opioid O

, O
is O
commonly O
used O
as O
a O
relapse O

, O
but O
its O
efficacy O
and O
the O

underpinning O
its O
clinical O
usefulness O
are O
not O
well O
characterized O
. O

In O
the O

The O

of O
cocaine O
addiction O
and O
long-term O

( O

evaluates O
plausible O
changes O
in O
brain O
structure O
and O
function O
of O
specific O
brain O
regions O
that O
sub-serve O

These O
include O
the O

; O
the O
lateral O

( O

the O

) O
that O

the O

shown O

Examination O
of O
possible O
neural O
changes O

suggests O
that O

occurs O
mostly O
in O
neural O

but O
to O
a O

Given O
the O
limitations O
of O
the O

in O

, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
lack O
of O
certainty O
about O
occasional O

in O
the O

group O
, O
these O
results O
may O
be O
considered O
as O
preliminary O
. O

However O
, O
they O
are O
compelling O
in O
that O
they O
suggest O
that O
male O
military O
veterans O
cocaine O
USERS O
are O
indefinitely O
at O
a O
higher O
risk O
for O
making O
lapses O
in O
judgment O
and O
decision-making O
leading O
to O
possible O
relapse O
, O
if O
reward O
salience O
and O
craving O
become O
more O
intense O
. O

Understanding O
the O
neurobiology O
of O
long-term O
cocaine O

First O
, O

were O
divided O
into O
three O

: O

have O
used O
cocaine O
within O
the O
last O
year O
, O
n O
= O
12 O
) O
, O
ABSTINENCE O
( O
those O
who O
were O
at O
different O

CONTROLS O
( O

that O
have O
never O
used O

. O

The O
first O
analysis O
focused O
on O
group O

CONTROLS O
, O
2 O
) O
USERS O
and O
ABSTINENCE O

Since O
the O
number O
of O
participants O
in O
the O
CONTROL O
group O
was O
relatively O
small O
, O
we O
first O
examined O
group O
difference O
between O
three O
groups O
as O
a O
means O
to O
preliminarily O
search O
for O
brain O
regions O
that O
may O
present O

. O

These O
differences O
were O
further O
refined O
by O
dividing O
the O

group O
into O
three O
subgroups O
: O
ABS1 O
( O

These O

This O
was O
done O

Results O
Network O

We O
found O

Findings O

the O

at O

some O
regions O
where O
myelin O

lower O
in O

, O
the O

that O
the O

Each O

participants O
indicated O
how O

they O
felt O

We O
averaged O

produce O
daily O

Participants O
also O
indicated O
whether O

they O
had O
experienced O
7 O
forms O
of O

that O

( O
e.g. O
, O
“ O

found O
each O

( O

We O

each O

( O

Finally O
, O
participants O
completed O
a O
set O
of O

that O
measured O
each O

level O
of O
negative O

( O
e.g. O
, O
“ O
I O
felt O

” O
) O
, O
positive O

e.g. O
, O

( O
e.g. O
, O
“ O

scales O
( O
1 O

We O
computed O
each O

Because O

We O

Following O

work O
, O
we O
extracted O
beta O
estimates O
of O
neural O

in O
the O

and O
examined O
whether O
this O
interacted O
with O
FHR O

to O
predict O
daily O

in O
a O

We O
used O

in O
these O

avoid O
using O

that O

Because O

were O
strongly O

, O

we O
averaged O
these O

We O
used O
two O
sets O

to O
test O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
weaker O

were O

The O

We O
hypothesized O

such O
that O
the O

A O
second O
set O
of O
analyses O
examined O
whether O

, O
and O
social O

on O
the O

We O

By O
“ O

” O
we O
mean O
the O
maximum O

These O
analyses O
let O
us O
( O

examine O
whether O
social O

even O
the O
day O

and O
( O

) O
establish O
whether O
social O

We O
again O
hypothesized O

that O

For O
both O
same-day O
and O

analyses O
, O
each O

( O
i.e. O
, O
negative O

Fixed-effect O
predictors O

Note O
that O
each O

Controlling O
for O
the O
previous-day O

we O

We O
“ O

Diary O

All O
continuous O

We O
unpacked O
significant O
interactions O
between O
conflict O

DLPFC O

using O
simple O

These O

uncover O
which O

These O

within O
both O

Such O

clarify O
which O

drove O

thereby O
testing O
whether O

For O

we O

To O
test O
whether O

we O

Note O
that O
these O

Demonstrating O
that O

However O

Recently O

suffer O
from O
a O
fundamental O

This O

Here O
, O
we O

a O

approach O

to O

Leveraging O
these O
important O

advances O
we O
find O
new O
evidence O
of O
substantial O
fragmentation O

reorganization O
involving O
primary O

areas O

Our O

Abstract O
Adolescents O
are O
notorious O
for O
engaging O
in O
risky O
, O
reward-motivated O
behavior O
, O
and O
this O
behavior O
occurs O
most O
often O
in O
response O
to O
social O
reward O
, O
typically O
in O
the O
form O
of O
peer O
contexts O
involving O
intense O
positive O
affect O
. O

A O
combination O
of O
greater O
neural O
and O
behavioral O
sensitivity O
to O
peer O
positive O
affect O
may O
characterize O
adolescents O
who O
are O
especially O
likely O
to O
engage O
in O
risky O
behaviors O
. O

Adolescents O

engaged O

more O
real-life O

behavior O
exhibited O
either O
a O

of O

Results O
Both O

Conclusions O
A O
shared O
pattern O

was O
found O
in O
COS O
and O
AOS O
, O
supporting O
the O

Methods O
Using O

By O

Results O
Significant O

Concerning O

we O
revealed O

The O
rate O

However O
, O
the O
CHR O

Further O
, O
learning O

in O
the O
CHR O

Both O
groups O
showed O

, O
the O

Second-order O
rule O
learning O
task O
In O
order O
to O
assess O
non-motor O
rule O
learning O
while O
targeting O
the O
CTCC O
, O
we O
used O
a O
second-order O
rule O
learning O
task O
developed O
by O
. O

This O
task O
was O
designed O
to O
dissociate O
the O
motoric O
response O
to O
a O
visual O
stimulus O
from O
the O
rule-learning O
itself O
. O

To O
do O
so O
, O
we O
used O
an O
event-related O
imaging O
design O
( O
described O
in O
more O
detail O
below O
) O
wherein O
we O
were O
able O
to O
dissociate O
the O
activation O
associated O
with O
the O
rule O
itself O
, O
from O
that O
associated O
with O
the O
preparation O
and O
execution O
of O
the O
motor O
response O
. O

Because O
we O
were O
particularly O
interested O
in O
cerebellar O
activation O
during O
learning O
in O
a O
non-motor O
paradigm O
in O
CHR O
individuals O
, O
we O
adapted O
the O
second-order O
rule O
learning O
condition O
to O
investigate O
group O
differences O
in O
cerebellar O
activation O
during O
learning O
. O

In O
order O
to O
focus O
on O
learning O
of O
the O
associations O
over O
time O
, O
we O
adapted O
the O
task O
such O
that O
participants O
completed O
6 O
blocks O
of O
learning O
, O
whereas O
, O
also O
included O
several O
additional O
conditions O
, O
including O
a O
first-order O
rule O
. O

Just O
learning O
blocks O
allow O
for O
the O
collection O
of O
enough O
data O
to O
look O
at O
early O
versus O
late O
learning O
, O
and O
to O
asses O
group O
differences O
in O
both O
behavior O
and O
brain O
activation O
during O
these O
phases O
. O

Further O
, O
we O
modified O
this O
task O
slightly O
in O
terms O
of O
timing O
to O
work O
with O
multi-band O
imaging O
, O
but O
were O
careful O
to O
keep O
task O
timing O
as O
close O
to O
the O
original O
paradigm O
as O
possible O
( O
timing O
details O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Participants O
were O
instructed O
to O
match O
an O
abstract O
shape O
with O
a O
color O
. O

There O
were O
four O
colors O
and O
four O
shapes O
. O

Initial O
responses O
were O
made O
by O
guessing O
. O

Participants O
received O
feedback O
about O
their O
performance O
after O
making O
their O
responses O
. O

During O
the O
task O
, O
participants O
were O
presented O
with O
an O
abstract O
shape O
in O
green O
, O
on O
a O
grey O

for O
460 O

This O
was O
both O

and O
followed O
by O
a O
variable O

After O
the O
delay O
, O
participants O
were O
presented O
with O
the O
word O
“ O
Go O

” O
written O
in O
red O
on O
a O
grey O

for O
230 O
ms O
, O
and O
were O
instructed O
to O
make O
a O
button-press O

following O
the O

. O

Next O
, O
participants O
saw O
four O

, O
each O
one O
a O
different O
color O
( O
black O
, O
blue O

from O

From O
left O

, O
the O
hourglass O

corresponded O
with O
the O
four O

. O

Finally O
, O
after O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
response O
cue O
, O
participants O
were O
presented O
with O
feedback O
. O

They O
saw O
either O
a O
green O
circle O
( O
correct O

) O
, O
red O
circle O
( O
incorrect O

) O
, O
or O
the O
word O
“ O

did O
not O
make O

during O
the O
920 O
ms O
“ O

, O
they O
received O
the O
“ O

. O

Timing O
of O
the O
“ O

” O
screen O
, O
response O

, O
and O
feedback O
was O
variable O
over O
a O
period O
of O
3680 O
ms. O
All O
participants O
completed O
6 O
blocks O
of O
the O
task O
, O
each O
with O
25 O

. O

The O
variable O
periods O
during O
both O
the O
initial O
“ O
instruction O

” O
period O
and O
later O
during O
the O
“ O

period O
were O
implemented O
so O
as O
to O
allow O
for O
jittering O
between O
events O
such O
that O
fMRI O

could O
be O
analyzed O
in O
an O
event-related O
manner O
. O

Jittering O
during O
both O
phases O
of O
the O
task O
was O
done O
over O
a O
period O
of O
3680 O
ms O
( O
equivalent O
to O
8 O
TRs O
) O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
because O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
the O
second-order O
non-motor O
rule O
, O
this O
allowed O
us O
to O
focus O
on O
an O
investigation O
of O
activation O
during O
the O
“ O
instruction O

” O
when O
processing O

of O
the O

and O
the O
association O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
during O
the O
“ O

” O
, O
where O
processing O
is O
related O
to O
motor O
preparation O
and O

. O

While O
we O
can O
not O
have O
a O
task O
without O
an O
overt O
motor O
response O
, O
we O
were O
however O
able O
to O
parse O
the O
activation O
associated O
with O
different O
components O
of O
the O
task O
, O
with O
the O
imaging O
design O
, O
consistent O
with O
prior O
work O
using O
this O
task O
. O

To O
assess O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
participants O
learned O
the O
task O
, O
participants O
also O
completed O
the O
task O
under O
dual-task O
conditions O
both O
before O
and O
after O
the O
learning O
blocks O
This O
condition O
served O
as O
a O
manipulation O
check O
to O
evaluate O
learning O
, O
and O
as O
such O
was O
not O
a O
condition O
of O
interest O
with O
respect O
to O
brain O
activity O
. O

During O
the O
dual-task O
condition O
, O
all O
aspects O
of O
the O
task O
remained O
the O
same O
; O
however O
, O
participants O
were O
asked O
to O
count O
backwards O
by O
7 O
, O
starting O
from O
500 O
. O

They O
were O
asked O
to O
count O
approximately O
once O
per O
second O
. O

We O
did O
not O
record O

accuracy O
, O
though O
we O
did O
encourage O
participants O
to O
continue O
counting O
throughout O
the O
task O
in O
any O
instances O
where O
the O
participant O
paused O
for O

As O
we O
were O
interested O
in O
cerebellar O

during O
learning O
, O
all O

was O
conducted O
in O
the O

However O
, O
we O
did O
not O
run O
the O
scanner O
during O
the O
pre- O
and O
post-learning O
dual-task O
blocks O
. O

This O
allowed O
the O
participant O
to O
speak O
without O
any O
additional O
motion O
confounds O
, O
and O
enabled O
us O
to O
hear O
their O
verbal O
counting O
without O
the O
background O
noise O
of O
the O
scanner O
. O

We O
quantified O
accuracy O
and O
reaction O
time O
. O

Accuracy O
was O
reported O
as O
the O
percent O
of O
correct O

, O
and O
was O
computed O
on O
a O
block O

. O

We O
also O
looked O
at O
both O
of O
these O

during O
the O
pre- O

Finally O
, O
we O
quantified O
the O

, O
in O
terms O
of O

during O
the O

We O
investigated O

ensure O
that O
all O

First O
, O
we O
used O
a O
2 O
× O
6 O
( O
group O
x O
block O
) O
mixed O
model O
ANOVA O
to O
investigate O
performance O
across O

. O

We O
were O
also O
interested O
in O
investigating O
the O
rate O
of O
learning O
, O
paralleling O
approaches O
taken O
in O
motor O
learning O
paradigms O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
were O
especially O
interested O
in O
the O
initial O
early O
learning O
phase O
, O
as O
cerebellar O
engagement O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
change O
during O
the O
early O
phases O
of O
learning O
. O

To O
determine O
the O
early O
learning O
phase O
, O
we O
followed O
the O
procedures O
outlined O
by O
Anguera O
and O
colleagues O
. O

We O
collapsed O
across O
groups O
and O
calculated O
the O
slope O
for O
consecutive O
blocks O
of O
increasing O
length O
( O
e.g. O
, O
first O
two O
blocks O
, O
first O
three O
blocks O
) O
, O
and O
tested O
which O
combination O
resulted O
in O
a O
significant O
drop O
in O
slope O
. O

We O
limited O
our O
analyses O
to O
the O
first O
four O
blocks O
, O
as O
upon O
visual O
inspection O
, O
participants O
in O
both O
groups O
began O
to O
reach O
asymptotic O
performance O
after O
block O

. O

We O
then O
compared O
the O
early O
learning O
rate O
between O
the O
two O
groups O
. O

While O
the O
dual-task O
condition O
is O
critical O
for O
testing O
the O
learning O
manipulation O
, O
it O
also O
allows O
us O
to O
investigate O
the O
dual-task O
cost O
, O
which O
can O
provide O
further O
insight O
into O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
individuals O
learned O
and O
automatized O
a O
task O
. O

Thus O
, O
we O
investigated O
group O
differences O
in O
the O
dual-task O
cost O
between O
the O
CHR O
and O
control O
groups O
after O
learning O
. O

Dual-task O
cost O
was O
operationalized O
as O
the O
difference O
in O
accuracy O
between O
the O
last O
block O
of O
the O
learning O
task O
and O
the O
dual-task O
condition O
that O
immediately O
followed O
( O
block O

accuracy O
– O
dual-task O
accuracy O
) O
. O

Positive O
values O
indicate O
better O
performance O
under O
the O
single O
task O
conditions O
, O
and O
the O
higher O
the O
value O
, O
the O
greater O
cost O
of O
performing O
under O
dual-task O
conditions O
. O

Finally O
, O
as O
we O
were O
interested O
in O
whether O
or O
not O
non-motor O
learning O
is O
related O
to O
symptom O
severity O
in O
CHR O
individuals O
, O
we O
also O
investigated O
correlations O
between O

, O
and O
severity O
of O

, O
negative O
, O
and O

summary O
Schizophrenia O
patients O

deficits O
in O
the O

attribution O
of O

to O
stimuli O
; O
such O
as O
aberrantly O
increased O
processing O
of O
irrelevant O
and O
insufficient O
processing O
of O
relevant O
information O
. O

We O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
subjective O
nature O
of O
relevance O
detection O
and O
its O
deficit O
in O
schizophrenia O
and O
developed O
an O
implicit O
learning O
paradigm O
that O
allowed O
for O
parallel O
learning O
from O
relevant O
and O
irrelevant O
information O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
idea O
that O
subjective O
relevance O
might O
be O
captured O
by O
Bayesian O
precision O
we O
set O
up O
different O
computational O
models O
of O
how O
subjective O
relevance O
guides O
learning O
and O
behavioral O
adaptation O
. O

We O
found O
that O
subjects O
use O
Bayesian O
precision O
to O
estimate O
stimulus O
relevance O
in O
order O
to O
integrate O
multidimensional O
information O
and O
adapt O
more O
to O
the O
subjectively O
relevant O
stimuli O
. O

This O
relevance O
weighted O
adaptation O
correlated O
with O
brain O
activation O
within O
the O
salience O
network O
. O

Further O
, O
schizophrenia O
patients O
displayed O
an O
increased O
aberrant O
tendency O
to O
irrelevant O
events O
which O
related O
to O
decreased O
striatal O
coding O

To O
conclude O
, O
our O
findings O
demonstrate O
how O
individual O
beliefs O
about O

can O
be O
inferred O
from O
computational O
models O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
suggest O
that O
aberrant O
salience O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
schizophrenia O
reflects O
an O
idiosyncratic O
bias O

We O
did O
not O
model O

separately O
because O
of O
two O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
the O
generative O
model O
was O
supposed O
to O
capture O
the O
subjects O
’ O

and O
they O
were O
not O
instructed O
about O
the O

Instead O
they O
were O
only O
primed O
with O
the O
distinction O

, O
in O
the O

Second O
, O
after O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O

we O
switched O
the O
relevant O
dimension O
( O
e.g O

shape O

. O

Hence O
, O
modeling O

would O
have O
introduced O
external O
information O
on O
the O

that O

not O

and O
thus O
not O
generative O
. O

The O
resulting O

Abstract O
Relapse O
after O
initially O

treatment O
is O
a O
significant O
problem O
facing O
the O
treatment O
of O
opioid O
dependence O
. O

Evidence O
suggests O
craving O
elicited O
by O
re‐exposure O
to O

cues O
may O
precipitate O
relapse O
. O

Attempts O
to O
identify O
neural O
biomarkers O
of O

have O
yielded O

We O
aimed O
to O

to O
follow O
the O
minute‐to‐minute O
evolution O
of O
brain O
responses O
, O
which O
correlate O
with O
the O
waxing O
and O
waning O
of O
craving O
. O

Newly O
detoxified O
male O
opioid‐dependent O

participants O
attended O
two O
separate O

during O
which O
they O

( O

followed O
by O
5 O
minutes O
of O

. O

Participants O
rated O
the O
intensity O
of O
their O
craving O
throughout O
each O
session O
. O

We O
hypothesized O
that O
subcortical/ventral O
prefrontal O
cortex O
( O
PFC O
) O
regions O
and O
dorsal O
PFC O
regions O
would O
show O
different O
associations O
with O
craving O
reflecting O
their O
putative O
roles O
in O

In O

, O
dorsal O

cingulate O
blood‐oxygen‐level‐dependent O

was O
higher O
than O
controls O
only O
during O
a O
period O
after O
cue O

when O
craving O
levels O
were O
declining O
. O

Against O
expectations O
, O
neither O
the O
ventral O
striatum O
nor O
ventral O
PFC O
was O
significantly O
recruited O
by O
drug O
cue O

Findings O
suggest O
that O
the O
amygdala O
has O
a O
central O
role O
in O
craving O
, O
whereas O
the O
dorsal O
anterior O
cingulate O
may O
control O
craving O
in O
treatment‐seeking O

. O

The O

that O
it O

For O
a O

here O
we O
computed O
the O

of O
the O

make O
sure O
they O
completely O

the O
instruction O
‘ O

asking O
participants O
to O
look O

After O
that O
, O
instructions O
were O
presented O
on O
the O

how O
to O

, O
but O
translated O

During O
‘ O

’ O
the O
participants O
were O
asked O
to O
just O
look O

, O
while O
the O

, O
‘ O
suppress O

and O
‘ O
increase O

. O

During O
‘ O
reappraisal O
’ O
the O
participant O
was O
instructed O
to O
reinterpret O
the O
picture O
in O
a O
way O
that O
decreases O
negative O
feelings O
. O

The O
instructions O
for O
‘ O
suppression O
’ O
asked O
the O
participant O
to O
suppress O
the O
expressive O
emotional O
reaction O
provoked O
by O
the O
picture O
. O

They O
were O
instructed O
that O
no O
one O
should O
be O
able O
to O
read O
their O
emotions O
from O
their O
face O
. O

The O
‘ O
increase O
’ O
condition O
entailed O
the O
opposite O
of O
the O
‘ O
reappraise O
’ O
condition O
, O
so O
participants O
had O
to O
increase O
the O
negative O
emotions O
caused O
by O
the O
stimulus O
. O

Stimuli O
were O
shown O
for O
6 O

After O
the O
emotion O

part O
of O
this O
task O
, O
the O
participants O
were O
asked O
to O
let O
their O
emotions O
linger O
while O
a O
black O
screen O
was O
shown O
to O
them O
( O
Lingering O

. O

Consequently O
, O
participants O
had O
to O
rate O
how O
negatively O
they O
felt O
at O
that O
moment O
( O

the O
word O
‘ O

was O
presented O
and O
participants O
could O
relax O
for O
4 O

The O

The O

The O

Further O

The O

the O

part O
as O
it O
enables O
learning O
association O
( O

Our O
interest O

Categorization O

The O
following O
factors O
were O
considered O
in O
choosing O
the O
measures O
to O
define O
the O
groups O
. O

The O
main O
purpose O
of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
there O
were O
differences O
in O
functional O
connectivity O
that O
were O
related O
to O
smoking O
or O
drinking O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
in O
the O
initial O
analysis O
, O
we O
categorized O
the O
participants O
for O
the O
smoking O
analysis O
into O
two O
groups O
, O
one O
which O
used O
significant O
amounts O
of O
cigarettes O
, O
and O
the O
other O
using O
no O
or O
low O
amounts O
of O
cigarettes O
. O

The O
same O
was O
performed O
for O
the O
division O
into O
two O
groups O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
alcohol O
drunk O

In O
making O
the O
cutoff O
, O
we O
ensured O
that O
there O
were O
reasonable O
numbers O
of O
participants O
in O
the O
high O
and O
the O
low O
amount O
groups O
. O

After O
the O
initial O
analysis O
, O
we O
wished O
to O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
different O
amounts O
of O
use O
of O
cigarettes O
or O
alcohol O
, O
and O
therefore O
used O
measures O
of O
the O
different O

of O

of O
each O
participant O
, O
and O
the O

Accordingly O
, O
to O
investigate O

we O

The O
non-smoker O
group O
contained O
participants O
who O
had O
never O
smoked O
during O
their O
lifetime O
. O

The O
occasional O
smoker O
group O
contained O
participants O
who O
experimented O
with O
cigarettes O
at O
least O
once O
in O
their O
lifetime O
but O
never O
became O
a O
regular O
smoker O
. O

The O
regular O
smoker O
group O
included O
those O
who O
smoked O
at O
least O
100 O
cigarettes O
in O
his O
or O
her O
lifetime O
and O
smoked O
at O
least O
one O

it O

that O

reduced O
in O

Here O
, O
we O
asked O
if O

We O
performed O
a O

to O
contrast O
tACS O

in O

We O
used O

investigate O
if O
a O
five-day O
, O
twice-daily O
10HztACS O
protocol O
enhances O
alpha O

and O
modulates O

that O
are O
reduced O
in O

We O
found O
that O
10Hz-tACS O
enhanced O
alpha O
oscillations O
and O
modulated O
functional O
connectivity O
in O
the O
alpha O
frequency O
band O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
10Hz-tACS O
enhanced O
the O

( O

) O
, O
which O
is O
reduced O

Importantly O
, O
clinical O

correlated O
with O

Together O
, O
our O
findings O
suggest O
that O

potential O
as O
a O

Background O
: O
Cognitive O
dysfunction O
is O
common O
in O
psychotic O

, O
and O
may O
reflect O
underlying O
pathophysiology O
. O

However O
, O
substantial O
cognitive O
heterogeneity O
exists O
both O
within O
and O
between O
diagnostic O
categories O
, O
creating O
challenges O
for O
studying O
the O
neurobiology O
of O
cognitive O
dysfunction O
in O

. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
identify O
patients O
with O
psychosis O
with O
intact O
versus O
impaired O
cognitive O
profiles O
, O
and O
to O
examine O
resting O

to O
determine O
the O
extent O

Results O
: O
Both O
cognitively O

Conclusions O
: O
We O
leveraged O
the O
heterogeneity O
in O
cognitive O
ability O
among O
patients O

Modeling O

Thus O

Finally O

This O

We O

a O

using O
Hi-C. O
With O
this O
in O

of O

, O
we O
mapped O

RESULTS O
: O
Neural O
differentiation O
was O
associated O
with O
genome-wide O
3DG O
remodeling O
, O
including O
pruning O
and O
de O
novo O
formations O
of O
chromosomal O
loopings O
. O

The O
NPC-to-neuron O
transition O
was O
defined O
by O
the O
pruning O
of O
loops O
involving O
regulators O
of O
cell O
proliferation O
, O
morphogenesis O
, O
and O
neurogenesis O
, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
a O
departure O
from O
a O
precursor O
stage O
toward O
postmitotic O
neuronal O
identity O
. O

Loops O
lost O
during O
NPC-to-glia O
transition O
included O
many O
genes O
associated O
with O
neuron-specific O
functions O
, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
non-neuronal O
lineage O
commitment O
. O

However O
, O
neurons O
together O
with O
NPCs O
, O
as O
compared O
with O
glia O
, O
harbored O
a O
much O
larger O
number O
of O
chromosomal O
interactions O
anchored O
in O
common O
variant O
sequences O
associated O
with O
SZ O
risk O
. O

Because O
spatial O
3DG O
proximity O
of O
genes O
is O
an O
indicator O
for O
potential O
coregulation O
, O
we O
tested O
whether O
the O
neural O
cell O
type–specific O
SZ-related O
“ O
chromosomal O
connectome O
” O
showed O
evidence O
of O
coordinated O
transcriptional O
regulation O
and O
proteomic O
interaction O
of O
the O
participating O
genes O
. O

To O
this O
end O
, O
we O
generated O
lists O
of O
genes O
anchored O
in O
cell O
type–specific O
SZ O
risk-associated O
interactions O
. O

Thus O
, O
for O
the O
NPC-specific O
interactions O
, O
we O
counted O
386 O
genes O
, O
including O
146 O
within O
the O
risk O
loci O
and O
another O
240 O
genes O
positioned O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
linear O
genome O
but O
connected O
via O
intrachromosomal O
contacts O
to O
risk O
locus O
sequences O
. O

Similarly O
, O
for O
the O
neuron-specific O
interactions O
, O
we O
identified O
385 O
genes O
: O
158 O
within O
risk O
loci O
and O
227 O
outside O
of O
risk O
loci O
. O

Last O
, O
for O
glia-specific O
interactions O
, O
we O
identified O
201 O
genes O
: O
88 O
within O
and O
113 O
outside O
of O
risk O
loci O
. O

We O
labeled O
the O
genes O
located O
outside O
of O
schizophrenia O
risk O
loci O
as O
“ O
risk O
locus–connect O
, O
” O
which O
we O
define O
as O
a O
collection O
of O
genes O
identified O
only O
through O
Hi-C O
interaction O
data O
, O
expanding—depending O
on O

sequences O
that O
is O
informed O
only O
by O

studies O
. O

This O
disease-related O
chromosomal O
connectome O
was O
associated O
with O
“ O

” O
of O
coordinated O
gene O

and O

at O

In O

these O

Hierarchical O

Finally O
, O
we O
built O
a O
hierarchical O

which O
consisted O
of O
two O

the O
in-layer O

the O

( O

To O
further O
reduce O

, O
we O
constructed O
the O
in-layer O
with O
three O
SVMs O
taking O
the O
inputs O
from O

( O

) O
, O

SNP O
( O

Each O
of O
these O

was O
trained O
using O
the O

including O
the O
Control O

, O
the O

and O
the O
short-term O

group O
. O

In O
the O
out-layer O
, O
one O
SVM O
( O

) O
received O
only O
3 O
input O
values O
from O
the O

values O
of O
SVM1–3 O
( O
a O
greater O
output O
value O
means O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
a O

) O
. O

With O
this O
hierarchical O
classifier O
, O
we O
significantly O
reduced O
the O
model O
complexity O
by O
taking O
the O
inputs O
from O
three O
kinds O
of O

, O
so O
as O

a O

The O

was O
then O
tested O

an O

Longitudinal O

We O
could O
not O
conduct O
a O
longitudinal O

on O
the O

because O
we O
only O
had O
32 O

However O
, O

at O
three O

( O

therefore O

we O
estimated O

( O

. O

To O

thus O
only O

Statistical O

Sample O
size O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
trial O
is O
to O
investigate O
the O
difference O
in O
brain O
functional O
and O
structural O
connectivity O
in O
schizophrenia O
patients O
receiving O
an O
active O
rTMS O
treatment O
and O
clinically O
responding O
to O
it O
or O
not O
as O
assessed O
by O
an O
amelioration O
of O
their O
AVH O
symptoms O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
sample O
size O
was O
calculated O
to O
determine O
the O
number O
of O
patients O
to O
be O
included O
in O
the O
active O
rTMS O
group O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
primary O
outcome O
, O
namely O
the O
difference O
in O
FA O
values O
at O
baseline O
between O
‘ O
responders O
’ O
and O
‘ O
non-responders O
’ O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
no O
study O
provides O
a O
significant O
difference O
of O
rs-fMRI O
measures O
or O
FA O
values O
for O
a O
given O
tract O
( O
such O
as O
the O
left O
arcuate O

) O
before O
and O
following O
a O
clinically O
effective O
versus O
a O
non-clinically O
effective O
rTMS O
treatment O
in O
schizophrenia O
patients O
, O
which O
would O
allow O
us O
to O
accurately O
estimate O
the O
adequate O
sample O
size O
for O
our O
trial O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
FA O
values O
are O
highly O
reproducible O
and O
have O
a O
reliable O
estimation O
of O
variance O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
focused O
on O
FA O
values O
to O
determine O
sample O
size O
. O

Therefore O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
FA O
values O
between O
schizophrenia O
patients O
and O
healthy O
subjects O
for O
the O
left O
arcuate O
fasciculus O
and O
assuming O
an O
α O
risk O
of O
0.05 O
and O
a O
1-β O
power O
of O
0.80 O
, O
we O
estimated O
the O
need O
to O
include O
32 O
patients O
for O
the O
active O
rTMS O
group O
. O

To O
overcome O
an O
estimated O
10 O
% O
drop-out O
, O
we O
increased O
our O
recruitment O
needs O
for O
active O
rTMS O
group O
to O
35 O
patients O
. O

Given O
a O
proportion O
of O
‘ O
responders O
’ O
and O
‘ O
non-responders O
’ O
to O
rTMS O
treatment O
as O
the O
one O
we O
propose O
for O
AVH O
in O
schizophrenia O
estimated O
at O
40 O
% O
and O
60 O
% O
, O
respectively O
, O
we O
will O
divide O
our O
cohort O
into O
14 O
‘ O
responders O
’ O
and O
21 O
‘ O
non-responder O
’ O
patients O
. O

According O
to O
a O
prior O
study O
, O
a O
minimum O
of O
14 O
participants O
per O
group O
( O
‘ O
responders O
’ O
or O
‘ O
non-responders O
’ O
) O
has O
been O
deemed O
sufficient O
to O
conduct O
statistical O
analysis O
in O
neuroimaging O
and O
detect O
a O
significant O
effect O
of O
rTMS O
on O
brain O
structural O
connectivity O
. O

Moreover O
, O
a O
sham O
rTMS O
group O
of O
10 O
patients O
will O
be O
followed O
in O
parallel O
to O
control O
for O
the O

rTMS O
effect O
on O
AVH O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
total O
number O
of O
participants O
required O
for O
the O
study O
is O
of O
45 O

the O
objectives O

Secondly O
, O
we O
will O
compare O
these O

, O
before O
versus O
after O
active O
rTMS O
, O
between O
groups O
of O
‘ O

‘ O

’ O
to O
determine O
explanatory O
markers O
of O
active O

AVH O

. O

For O
both O

Working O

are O
key O
features O

are O

The O

WM O

their O
relationship O

clinical O

remain O
unclear O
. O

Contemporary O
models O
propose O
that O
WM O
requires O
synchronous O
activity O

a O

network O
, O
including O
lateral O

( O

) O
and O

This O
suggests O
that O
WM O

in O

may O
be O
due O
to O
PFC O

( O

) O
impairments O
rather O
than O

We O
tested O
this O
hypothesis O
by O
measuring O
the O
magnitude O
of O
FC O
between O
lateral O

and O
visual O

within O
these O
regions O

WM O

We O
found O

compared O
to O

subjects O
in O
the O
context O
of O
similar O
levels O
of O

Furthermore O
, O
this O
decreased O
FC O
was O
associated O
with O
task O

clinical O
symptomatology O
in O
patients O
. O

The O
magnitude O
of O
FC O
, O
particularly O
during O
the O

, O
was O
positively O
correlated O

, O
while O

these O

We O
designed O
a O
novel O
visual O
WM O
paradigm O
to O
facilitate O
the O
planned O
unbiased O
, O
functional O
ROI-based O
fMRI O
analyses O
. O

The O
design O
of O
our O
visual O
object O
WM O
task O
temporally O
segregates O
the O
phases O
of O
cue O
, O
delay O
, O
and O
probe O
. O

In O
this O
manner O
, O
this O
task O
can O
be O
considered O
a O
variant O
of O
the O
Sternberg O
Task O
. O

This O
design O
was O
chosen O
over O
a O
traditional O
N-back O
task O
in O
which O
the O
three O
phases O
can O
not O
be O
temporally O
separated O
. O

There O
were O
two O
tasks O
in O
this O
paradigm O
, O
which O
were O
identical O
in O
terms O
of O
trial O
structure O
, O
stimulus O
presentations O
, O
order O
and O
timing O
, O
but O
differed O
in O
WM O
requirements O
. O

The O
first O
stimulus O
presented O
in O
both O
tasks O
is O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
“ O
cue O
” O
face O
. O

It O
was O
displayed O
for O
one O
second O
and O
then O
it O
was O
replaced O
by O
a O
crosshair O
. O

The O
color O
of O
the O
crosshair O
was O
initially O
black O
, O
but O
changed O
color O
after O
two O
seconds O
. O

This O
new O
color O
indicated O
the O
task O
of O
the O
trial O
: O
blue O
indicated O
the O
WM O
task O
, O
which O
required O
subjects O
to O
maintain O
the O
cue O
face O
in O
WM O
across O
a O
15 O
s O
delay O
period O
and O
to O
make O
a O
match O
discrimination O
with O
the O
face O
appearing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
delay O
; O
red O
indicated O
the O
Gender O
ID O
( O
GID O
) O
task O
, O
which O
did O
not O
require O
WM O
for O
task O
completion O
but O
rather O
for O
the O
subjects O
to O
make O
a O
gender O
discrimination O
of O
the O
face O
appearing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
delay O
period O
. O

The O
faces O
shown O
were O
chosen O
to O
be O
gender O
ambiguous O
, O
so O
the O
results O
from O
the O
GID O
task O
are O
not O
expected O
to O
be O
meaningful O
. O

A O
critical O
aspect O
of O
the O
design O
was O
that O
the O
task O
for O
a O
particular O
trial O
was O
revealed O
only O
after O
cue O
face O
offset O
. O

This O
design O
forced O
subjects O
to O
encode O
into O
WM O
a O
cue O
face O
whenever O
it O
appeared O
, O
even O
during O
GID O
trials O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
trial O
task O
was O
revealed O
two O
seconds O
, O
and O
not O
immediately O
, O
after O
cue O
offset O
in O
order O
to O
enhance O
the O
temporal O
separation O
between O
the O
engagement O
of O
encoding O
and O
maintenance O
related O
neural O
processes O
by O
the O
subject O
. O

This O
temporal O
separation O
is O
necessary O
to O
disambiguate O
the O
BOLD O
signal O
reflecting O
encoding O
and O
maintenance O
related O
events O
. O

Subjects O
completed O
40 O
trials O
of O
each O
task O
. O

There O
were O
ten O
trials O
within O
each O
of O
eight O
runs O
. O

Trial O
order O
was O
randomly O
intermixed O
. O

To O
ensure O
that O
all O
subjects O
were O
engaged O
with O
the O
task O
, O
we O
imposed O
a O
performance O
criterion O
of O
60 O
% O
accuracy O
on O
the O
WM O
task O
. O

We O
chose O
a O
WM O
task O
that O
was O
not O
too O
difficult O
for O
both O
healthy O
control O
( O
HC O
) O
and O
schizophrenia O
( O
SZ O
) O
groups O
to O
accurately O
complete O
so O
that O
there O
would O
be O
sufficient O
number O
of O
correct O
trials O
with O
which O
to O
conduct O
the O
FC O
analyses O
. O

A O
task O
that O
was O
too O
difficult O
would O
likely O
have O
yielded O
a O
fairly O
large O
difference O
across O
groups O
in O
the O
number O
of O
correct O
trials O
. O

Low O
correct O
trial O
numbers O
in O
the O
patient O
group O
would O
reduce O
our O
ability O
to O
reliably O
measure O
true O
FC O
strength O
and O
a O
large O
group O
difference O
in O
trial O
numbers O
could O
introduce O
bias O
in O
terms O
of O
group O

. O

we O

Given O

the O

these O
ROIs O
, O
we O
did O
not O
employ O
a O

and O
instead O
we O
utilized O
an O
ROI O

This O
approached O

the O

analyzed O
( O

. O

We O
utilized O
functional O
ROIs O
, O
rather O
than O
anatomic O
ROIs O
, O
for O
hypothesis O

to O
enhance O

. O

The O
lateral O

is O
a O
relatively O
broad O

. O

Thus O
, O
the O
use O
of O
anatomically O

of O
the O

would O
likely O
significantly O
diminish O

One O
of O
the O

in O

is O
the O
“ O

We O
avoided O
this O

The O

For O

For O
the O
assessment O

we O

Previous O
studies O

were O
not O

, O
as O

not O
be O
directly O
applicable O
to O
[ O

SCH23390 O
BPND O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

First O
, O
[ O
11C O
] O
NNC112 O
has O
a O
significantly O
higher O
affinity O
for O
the O
D1R O
. O

Second O
, O
for O
both O
radioligands O
5-HT2A O
receptor O
binding O
contributes O
to O
a O
nonnegligible O
fraction O
of O
cortical O
binding O
, O
and O
differences O
in O
this O
fraction O
might O
cause O
systematic O
differences O
. O

Although O
this O
fraction O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
similar O
in O
magnitude O
for O
both O
tracers O
, O
for O
[ O
11C O
] O
SCH23390 O
this O
estimate O
was O
derived O
from O
a O
PET O
examination O
of O
only O
2 O
baboons O
and O
not O
from O
humans O
. O

Lastly O
, O
in O
studies O
using O
[ O
11C O
] O
NNC112 O
, O
the O
main O
outcome O
parameter O
has O
been O
BPP O
, O
with O
BPND O
calculated O
in O
all O
cases O
but O
one O
using O
arterial O
plasma O
measurements O
. O

To O
assure O
that O
these O
hypotheses O
were O
not O
differentially O
influenced O
by O
different O
sizes O
of O
previously O
reported O
effects O
, O
we O
opted O
to O
use O
the O
same O
scale O
for O
both O
the O
increase O
and O
decrease O
prior O
based O
on O
a O
weighted O
average O
of O
previous O
differences O
. O

We O
therefore O
used O
a O
SD O
of O
31 O
% O
for O
DLPFC O
and O
of O
21 O
% O
for O
the O
STR O
. O

We O
also O
tested O
whether O
other O
factors O
differing O

might O
have O
a O
substantial O
impact O
on O
the O
results O
and O
thereby O
act O
as O
a O

For O
the O
assessment O
of O
whether O

was O
affected O
by O

, O
we O
also O
made O
use O
of O

performed O

a O
manner O
identical O
to O
the O

. O

To O
assess O
whether O
these O
factors O
impacted O
our O
outcomes O
, O
we O
tested O
whether O
a O
large O
specific O
effect O
was O
absent O
for O
each O
factor O
. O

Such O
conclusions O
can O
not O
be O
drawn O
from O
an O
insignificant O
P O
value O
assessing O
the O
differences O
between O
groups O
but O
rather O
requires O
a O
test O
of O
groups O
’ O
similarity O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
we O
made O
use O
of O
equivalence O
testing O
. O

This O
allows O
for O
testing O
of O
the O
equivalence O
of O
outcomes O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
difference O
, O
and O
requires O
the O
description O
of O
appropriate O
equivalence O
bounds O
within O
which O
the O
outcomes O
are O
assumed O
to O
be O
sufficiently O
similar O
. O

We O
performed O
a O
power O
analysis O
for O
the O
equivalence O
bound O
for O
2-sample O
equivalence O
tests O
with O
a O
type O
I O
error O
rate O
of O
0.05 O
, O
a O
power O
of O
0.8 O
, O
and O
samples O
of O
18 O
in O
each O
group O
. O

According O
to O
this O
analysis O
, O
there O
was O
sufficient O
power O
to O
assess O
equivalence O
within O
bounds O
of O
−1 O
< O
Cohen O
’ O
s O
D O
< O
1 O
. O

Since O
Cohen O
’ O
s O
D O
= O
0.8 O
represents O
a O
large O
effect O
size O
, O
we O
can O
thereby O
rule O
out O
large O
effects O
. O

While O
it O
would O
have O
been O
desirable O
to O
assess O
equivalence O
within O
more O
restrictive O
equivalence O
bounds O
, O
this O
approach O
is O
nonetheless O
superior O
to O
the O
statistically O
invalid O
approach O
of O
accepting O

Transparency O
Statement O
We O

the O
following O

statement O
suggested O
by O
Simmons O

All O

below O
. O

We O
report O
how O
we O

any O
) O
, O

Sample O
Size O
Determination O
The O
final O
study O
sample O
size O
was O
determined O
by O
the O
number O
of O
participants O
included O
in O
the O
study O
when O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
data O
collection O
was O
to O
be O
concluded O
in O
2008 O
and O
consisted O
of O
18 O
patients O
and O
18 O
healthy O

. O

No O
power O

was O
performed O
before O
or O

; O
however O
, O

For O
a O
2 O
independent O
sample O
t O

, O
with O
an O
alpha O
of O
0.05 O
, O
this O

power O
to O
detect O
an O

size O
of O
Cohen O

This O
corresponds O
to O
a O

U3 O
of O
83 O
% O
and O
a O
common O

size O
of O
75 O

. O

This O
effect O
is O
larger O
than O
we O
would O
expect O
, O
and O
we O
determined O
a O

that O
if O
significant O
, O
this O

could O
likely O
represent O
a O
Type O
M O

, O
and O
if O
insignificant O
, O
this O

could O
likely O
represent O
a O
Type O
II O
error O
. O

Exclusions O
One O
PET O
measurement O
from O
a O

All O

were O
included O
in O
the O

Measures O
and O
Analyses O
The O

confirm O
that O
all O

to O
the O

and O
that O
no O

. O

All O

where O
it O

For O

we O
note O
that O
an O

was O
run O
on O
a O
subset O
of O

for O
which O
there O
were O
no O
significant O

Hence O
, O
there O
were O
no O

However O
, O
due O
to O
the O

, O
the O
fact O
that O

These O

Briefly O

the O
JICA O

utilizes O

information O

information O
in O

identify O
“ O

maximize O

This O
approach O
identifies O
“ O

” O
which O
covary O
the O

way O
across O

. O

The O
algorithm O
outputs O

, O

reflect O
the O

of O
the O
joint O

. O

Loading O

A O
priori O
, O
we O
planned O
to O
investigate O
components O
with O
time O
courses O
that O
correlated O
with O
the O
N400 O
and O
regressed O
those O
time O
courses O
onto O
the O
N400 O
grand O

to O
assist O
with O
component O

. O

We O
estimated O
the O
number O
of O
components O
to O
calculate O
based O
on O
minimum O
descriptive O
length O
criteria O
for O
fMRI O
and O
a O
parallel O
test O
for O
ERP O
for O
each O
feature O
. O

Given O
the O
primacy O
of O
our O
interest O
in O
identifying O
a O
joint O
component O
that O
clearly O
captured O
the O
N400 O
difference O
wave O
in O
the O
ERP O
waveforms O
, O
we O
considered O
ICA O
solutions O
involving O
extractions O
of O
between O
2 O
and O
7 O
components O
. O

After O
reviewing O
the O
components O
resulting O
from O
these O
solutions O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
2-component O
solution O
yielded O
a O
joint O
component O
that O
clearly O
captured O
the O
N400 O
difference O
waveform O
for O
both O
IC O
and O
OC O

. O

Accordingly O
, O
this O
joint O
component O
was O
extracted O
and O
used O
in O
our O
subsequent O
analyses O
. O

Given O
our O
interest O

we O
focused O

All O

most O

In O
our O
analyses O
, O
the O

revealed O
a O
max O

for O
the O
OC O

so O
we O

a O

Alcohol O
Variables O
Two O
alcohol O
variables O
from O
the O
HCP O
dataset O
were O
examined O
in O
the O
current O
study O
. O

The O
first O
, O
“ O
Total O
drinks O
in O

7 O
days O
” O
, O
was O
taken O
from O
the O
retrospective O
alcohol O
use O
assessment O
. O

The O
second O
, O
“ O
Frequency O
of O
drinking O
5+ O
drinks O
in O
past O
12 O
months O
” O
, O
was O
taken O
from O
the O
SSAGA O
assessment O
. O

This O
variable O
was O
coded O
categorically O
in O
the O
HCP O
dataset O
, O
but O
the O
coding O
for O
the O
highest O
frequency O
differed O
for O
males O
and O
females O
( O
i.e. O
, O
the O
maximum O
response O
of O
3+ O
days/week O
was O
coded O
as O
1 O
for O
males O
, O
but O
2 O
for O
females O
) O
. O

The O
next O
lowest O
value O
( O
1–2 O
days/week O
) O
was O
coded O
as O
2 O
for O
both O
males O
and O
females O
. O

Therefore O
, O
no O
distinction O
could O
be O
made O
between O
1–2 O
vs. O
3+ O
days/week O
for O
females O
. O

To O
standardize O
the O
maximum O

, O
the O
data O
were O
recoded O
as O

( O
and O
reverse-scored O

The O
ACC O
composite O

was O
created O
by O
combining O
the O

Lastly O
, O
the O
OFC O

Background O
: O
The O

, O
although O
these O

find O

. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
clarify O
the O
pattern O
of O
cortico-striatal O
connectivity O
, O
including O
whether O
cortico-striatal O

is O
transdiagnostic O
and O
extends O

Results O
: O
Cortical O

indicated O
that O
overall O

Conclusions O
: O
The O
current O
study O
found O
evidence O
of O
transdiagnostic O
cortico-striatal O
dysconnectivity O
in O
both O

Abstract O
Background O
Individuals O

As O
part O
of O

, O
the O
hypothalamus O

Rodent O
studies O
suggested O
inter-related O
roles O

the O
hypothalamus O
in O

However O
, O

investigated O
hypothalamic O
responses O

We O
examined O
the O

Results O
At O
a O
corrected O
threshold O
, O
cocaine-dependent O

Further O
, O
the O

Conclusions O
The O

that O
the O
mechanisms O

Because O

we O

Impaired O

antipsychotic‐naive O

Abstract O
Schizophrenia O
has O
been O
conceptualized O
as O
a O
disorder O
arising O
from O
structurally O
pathological O
alterations O
to O
white‐matter O
fibers O
in O
the O
brain O
. O

However O
, O
few O
studies O
have O
focused O
on O
white‐matter O
functional O
changes O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

Considering O
that O
converging O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
white‐matter O
resting O
state O
functional O
MRI O
( O
rsfMRI O
) O
signals O
can O
effectively O
depict O
neuronal O
activity O
and O
psychopathological O
status O
, O
this O
study O
examined O
white‐matter O
network‐level O
interactions O
in O
antipsychotic‐naive O
first‐episode O
schizophrenia O
( O
FES O
) O
to O
facilitate O
the O
interpretation O
of O
the O
psychiatric O
pathological O
mechanisms O
in O
schizophrenia O
. O

We O
recruited O
42 O
FES O
patients O
( O
FESs O
) O
and O
38 O
healthy O
controls O
( O
HCs O
) O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
underwent O
rsfMRI O
. O

We O
identified O
11 O
white‐matter O
functional O
networks O
, O
which O
could O
be O
further O
classified O
into O
deep O
, O
middle O
, O
and O
superficial O
layers O
of O
networks O
. O

We O
then O
examined O
network‐level O
interactions O
among O
these O
11 O
white‐matter O
functional O
networks O
using O
coefficient O
Granger O
causality O
analysis O
. O

We O
employed O
group O
comparisons O
on O
the O
influences O
among O
11 O
networks O
using O
network‐based O
statistic O
. O

Excitatory O
influences O
from O
the O
middle O
superior O
corona O
radiate O
network O
to O
the O
superficial O
orbitofrontal O
and O
deep O
networks O
were O
disrupted O
in O
FESs O
compared O
with O
HCs O
. O

Additionally O
, O
an O
extra O
failure O
of O
suppression O
within O
superficial O
networks O
( O
including O
the O
frontoparietal O
network O
, O
temporofrontal O
network O
, O
and O
the O
orbitofrontal O
network O
) O
was O
observed O
in O
FESs O
. O

We O
additionally O
recruited O
an O
independent O
cohort O
( O
13 O
FESs O
and O
13 O
HCs O
) O
from O
another O
center O
to O
examine O
the O
replicability O
of O
our O
findings O
across O
centers O
. O

Similar O
replication O
results O
further O
verified O
the O
white‐matter O
functional O

model O
of O
schizophrenia O
. O

The O
novel O
findings O
of O
impaired O
interactions O
among O
white‐matter O
functional O
networks O
in O
schizophrenia O
indicate O
that O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
schizophrenia O
may O
also O
lie O
in O

In O
the O

the O

showed O
reduced O

not O

The O

across O
a O

These O

show O
that O
an O

which O
we O
have O
used O
to O
already O
publish O

from O
the O
ICCAM O

. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
each O
trial O
, O
participants O
viewed O
one O
of O
three O
symbols O
( O
a O
cue O
) O
that O
indicated O
the O
potential O
to O
gain O
fifty O
pence O
( O

. O

Each O
cue O
was O
presented O
for O
one O
second O
, O
with O
a O
variable O
duration O
( O
2–4 O
s O
) O
for O
the O
subsequent O
anticipation O
period O
. O

Following O
the O
anticipation O
period O
, O
participants O
made O
a O
button O
press O
response O
upon O
the O
presentation O
of O
a O
visual O
target O
( O

located O
within O
a O
circle O
) O
. O

Following O
their O
response O
to O
the O
visual O
target O
, O
participants O
received O
feedback O
( O
1.5 O

) O
as O
to O
whether O
they O
were O
successful O
( O
“ O

or O

( O

on O

point O
in O
the O

Following O

, O
there O
was O
an O
end O

period O
( O
3–5 O

) O
before O
the O
commencement O
of O

Because O
the O
primary O
objective O
of O
ICCAM O
was O
to O
examine O
the O
neural O
correlates O
of O
reward O
anticipation O
, O
we O
chose O
to O
use O
a O
smaller O
number O
of O
loss O
trials O
in O
order O
to O
amplify O
the O
incentive O
salience O
of O
the O
gain O
trials O
during O
the O
task O
. O

Consequently O
, O
there O
was O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
gain O
, O
6 O
lose O
and O
18 O
neutral O
trials O
on O
each O
run O
of O
the O
task O
. O

The O
MID O
task O
was O
tailored O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
visual O
target O
reaction O
time O
of O
each O
participant O
by O
using O
a O
staircase O
algorithm O
, O
such O
that O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
visual O
target O
became O
shorter O
as O
performance O
improved O
during O
the O
experiment O
. O

This O
enabled O
us O
to O
set O
a O
limit O
on O
the O
success O
rate O
of O
each O
participant O
( O

testing O
the O

To O
start O
, O
we O
tested O
the O
relationship O

both O
the O

We O
then O
chose O
four O
additional O

to O
test O
individually O
in O
GLMs O
, O
where O
we O
tested O
the O

for O

the O
four O

The O
additional O

tested O
included O
DMN O

These O
four O
additional O

served O
as O

, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O

unique O
to O
the O

As O
the O

was O
the O
primary O

of O
our O

, O
we O
tested O
the O

Using O
a O

we O
tested O
the O

for O
each O
of O
the O
15 O
edges O
within O

We O
conducted O
these O

the O

In O

These O

For O
these O

, O
we O
planned O
to O
test O
the O
interaction O
between O
each O
of O
the O
edges O
within O
the O

that O

, O
using O

for O

the O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
) O
. O

Given O
that O
the O
study O
tests O
multiple O
models O
, O
we O
conceptualize O
the O
issue O
of O
multiple O
comparisons O
as O
follows O
. O

We O
consider O
the O
two O
models O
in O
which O
we O
test O
the O
relationship O
between O
DRD2 O
methylation O
and O
average O
RECN/LECN O
to O
be O
the O
primary O
models O
. O

Given O
that O
we O
used O
the O
other O
networks O
( O
ie O
, O
DMN O
, O
PS O
, O
and O
AS O
) O
as O
control O
networks O
, O
we O
used O
an O
uncorrected O
P O
< O
0.05 O
significance O
threshold O
for O
the O
primary O
models O
. O

Next O
, O
we O
consider O
the O
follow O
up O
analysis O
of O
individual O
edges O
within O
both O
the O
RECN O
and O
LECN O
as O
a O
way O
of O
determining O
which O
edges O
within O
the O
overall O
networks O
are O
driving O
the O
association O
between O
LECN/RECN O
connectivity O
and O
DRD2 O
methylation O
. O

Given O
that O
the O
purpose O
of O
these O
follow O
up O
tests O
is O
to O
determine O
what O
is O
driving O
the O
overall O
effect O
, O
these O
tests O
are O
considered O
significant O
at O
the O
P O
< O
0.05 O
threshold O
. O

This O
logic O
is O
akin O
to O
the O
argument O
made O
by O
Stevens O
regarding O
multivariate O
analyses O
of O
variance O
( O
MANOVAs O
) O
and O
follow O
up O
univariate O
tests O
. O

Briefly O
, O
Stevens O
argues O
that O
if O
the O
overall O
MANOVA O
is O
significant O
, O
then O
the O
individual O
univariate O
tests O
are O
protected O
from O
multiple O
comparisons O
. O

In O
order O
to O
use O
this O
logic O
, O
we O
also O
tested O
the O
relationship O
between O
RECN O
edge O
connectivity O
and O
DRD2 O
methylation O
using O
15 O
degree O
of O
freedom O
MANOVAs O
, O
which O
included O
all O
15 O
RECN O
edges O
and O
all O
15 O
LECN O
edges O
in O
two O
separate O
MANOVA O
models O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
moderation O
and O
mediation O
analyses O
are O
considered O
exploratory O
post O
hoc O
analyses O
and O
are O
therefore O
presented O
as O
uncorrected O
P O
values O
. O

The O

Although O
the O

Both O

assessed O
through O

After O

, O
increased O
static O

observed O
between O

Increased O

Moreover O

the O

these O

might O
have O
an O
effect O

the O
