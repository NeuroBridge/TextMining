__label__0 fMRI study of neural sensitization to hedonic stimuli in long‐term , daily cannabis users Abstract Although there is emergent evidence illustrating neural sensitivity to cannabis cues in cannabis users , the specificity of this effect to cannabis cues as opposed to a generalized hyper‐sensitivity to hedonic stimuli has not yet been directly tested .
__label__0 Using fMRI , we presented 53 daily , long‐term cannabis users and 68 non‐using controls visual and tactile cues for cannabis , a natural reward , and , a sensory‐perceptual control object to evaluate brain response to hedonic stimuli in cannabis users .
__label__1 The results showed an interaction between group and reward type such that the users had greater response during cannabis cues relative to natural reward cues ( i.e . , fruit ) in the orbitofrontal cortex , striatum , anterior cingulate gyrus , and ventral tegmental area compared to non‐users ( cluster‐threshold z = 2.3 , P < 0.05 ) .
__label__1 In the users , there were positive brain‐behavior correlations between neural response to cannabis cues in fronto‐striatal‐temporal regions and subjective craving , marijuana‐related problems , withdrawal symptoms , and levels of THC metabolites ( cluster‐threshold z = 2.3 , P < 0.05 ) .
__label__1 These findings demonstrate hyper‐responsivity , and , specificity of brain response to cannabis cues in long‐term cannabis users that are above that of response to natural reward cues .
__label__1 These observations are concordant with incentive sensitization models suggesting sensitization of mesocorticolimbic regions and disruption of natural reward processes following drug use .
__label__1 Although the cross‐sectional nature of this study does not provide information on causality , the positive correlations between neural response and indicators of cannabis use ( i.e . , THC levels ) suggest that alterations in the reward system are , in part , related to cannabis use .

__label__0 MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was approved by the University of Texas at Dallas and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Boards .
__label__1 This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki .
__label__1 All participants provided informed written consent to participate in the study and were provided monetary compensation for their participation .
__label__1 Participants Fifty nine regular cannabis users and 70 non‐users participated in this study .
__label__1 The study's inclusion criteria were : right‐handedness , English as the primary language , absence of current or history of psychosis , traumatic brain injury , and MRI contraindications ( e.g . , pregnancy , non‐removal metallic implants , claustrophobia ) .
__label__1 All of the participants were screened via urinalysis for other drugs of abuse and were excluded if drugs ( other than cannabis ) were detected .
__label__1 Participants were excluded for regular tobacco use as defined by smoking more than a pack of cigarettes a month as well as current alcohol dependence based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV ( SCID ) [ First et al . , 1997 ] .
__label__1 Cannabis users were recruited based on self‐reported history of regular cannabis use with a minimum of 5,000 lifetime occasions , as well as daily use over the preceding 60 days .
__label__1 Verification of cannabis use was conducted via quantification of THC metabolites as ng / ml ( over creatinine ) via gas chromatography ( GC ) / mass spectroscopy ( MS ) .
__label__1 The non‐using controls were recruited based on the absence of daily cannabis use at any period in their lifetime , in addition to no current illicit drug use in the past 60 days .
__label__0 Behavioral Data We collected ( 1 ) the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire ( MCQ ) [ Heishman et al . , 2001 ] to measure basal level craving for cannabis immediately prior to and after the MRI scan and , ( 2 ) the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist , ( MWC ) [ Budney et al . , 1999 ] to measure self‐reported withdrawal symptoms immediately prior to the MRI scan , and , ( 3 ) the Marijuana Problems Survey ( MPS ) [ Stephens et al . , 2000 ] to measure problems associated with cannabis use .
__label__1 Information pertaining to self‐reported grams of cannabis use per day was also obtained from the cannabis users .
__label__1 Behavioral Data Analyses T‐tests and chi‐square tests were used in SPSS 21 for descriptive purposes as well as to compare the groups on demographic and substance use variables ( Table 1 ) .
__label__1 Demographic and substance use characteristics of participants Users mean ( SD ) Non‐users mean ( SD ) Group difference N 53 68 — Age 30.66 ( 7.48 ) 31.41 ( 10.20 ) t ( 118.59 ) = 0.467 ; P = 0.641 Males ( N , % ) 33 , 62.3% 33 , 48.5% χ2 ( 1 ) = 2.267 ; P = 0.132 Years of education 13.06 ( 3.05 ) 16.83 ( 2.79 ) t ( 117 ) = 7.039 ; P < 0.001 # Cigarette smoking days / 60 days 1.58 ( 3.93 ) .34 ( 2.67 ) t ( 87.28 ) = − 1.979 ; P = 0.051 # Drinking days / 60 days 12.42 ( 16.76 ) 7.87 ( 14.42 ) t ( 119 ) = − 1.603 ; P = 0.112 Cannabis use Duration of regular use ( years ) 12.46 ( 7.74 ) n / a n / a Lifetime CUD symptom count 2.47 ( 2.42 ) n / a n / a MJ grams per day 2.15 ( 1.76 ) n / a n / a THC / creatinine ratio during abstinent state 2.05 ( 1.71 ) n / a n / a Marijuana withdrawal checklist ( MWC ) total score 9.6 ( 8.96 ) n / a n / a Pre‐scan marijuana craving questionnaire ( MCQ ) sum 237.04 ( 154.48 ) n / a n / a Post‐scan MCQ sum 250.57 ( 170.65 ) n / a n / a fMRI Data fMRI scan acquisition The users were scanned following a 72 ‐ h abstinence from cannabis use .
__label__1 Although there is no reliable measure of acute abstinence from cannabis , we measured THC metabolites as ng / ml ( over creatinine ) ( via GC / MS ) from the participants before and after approximately 72 ‐ h period to detect reductions in THC metabolites , in addition to self‐report .
__label__1 All participants were asked to abstain from alcohol for 24 h and from caffeine and cigarettes for the 2 ‐ h before their scheduled scan .
__label__1 Breath alcohol level was also collected to confirm blood alcohol content of 0.000 at the beginning of the scan .
__label__1 Additionally , all participants were asked to eat a meal before their scan appointment to reduce confounding effects of hunger .
__label__1 Scanning sessions took place in the Advanced Imaging Research Center ( AIRC ) on the main University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( UTSW ) campus .
__label__1 MRI images were collected using a 3T Philips whole body scanner equipped with Quasar gradient subsystem ( 40 mT / m amplitude , a slew rate of 220 mT / m / ms ) .
__label__0 Structural MRI scans were collected with a MPRAGE sequence with the following parameters : TR / TE / TI = 8.2 / 3.70 / 1,100 ms , flip angle = 12 ° , FOV = 256 × 256 mm , slab thickness = 160 mm ( along left‐right direction ) , voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm , total scan time = 3 min 57 s . fMRI scans were collected using a gradient echo , echo‐planar sequence with the intercomissural line ( AC‐PC ) as a reference ( TR : 2.0 s , TE : 29 ms , flip angle : 75 ° , matrix size : 64 × 64 , 39 slices , voxel size : 3.44 × 3.44 × 3.5 mm3 ) . fMRI cannabis cue exposure task During the fMRI session , the participants completed a cannabis cue‐exposure task modified from the one previously described by Filbey et al . [ 2009b ] to include a cue for a natural reward .
__label__1 The task consisted of two runs , each one with a different pseudorandom order of visual and tactile presentations of : ( i ) a single cannabis cue ( six trials ) , ( ii ) a single natural reward cue ( six trials ) , and ( iii ) a single neutral cue ( six trials ) .
__label__1 Each cue was presented for twentys .
__label__1 Following the cue exposure period , we measured momentary subjective craving by asking the participants to respond to : “ Please rate your urge to use marijuana right now . ”
__label__1 Responses were measured using a scale from zero ( no urge at all ) to ten ( extremely high urge ) ( five s ) .
__label__1 A twenty s washout period completed each trial .
__label__1 Responses were recorded using a fiber‐optic pad .
__label__1 The participants were pseudorandomly given different orders of the runs ( e.g . , run A , run B or run B , run A ) .
__label__1 We presented task stimuli to the participants based on their response to “ what is your preferred cannabis use method ? ”
__label__1 Twenty‐three users selected the pipe , eleven selected the bong , eleven selected the blunt and eight selected the joint .
__label__1 For the non‐users , cannabis paraphernalia were matched to what was presented to the users resulting in Twenty‐seven non‐users presented with the pipe , Twenty‐two presented with the bong , three presented with the blunt and eleven presented with the joint .
__label__1 There was missing information on five of the participants .
__label__1 For the natural reward cues , we selected fruit because of its appetitiveness and because it exists within the natural environment and would have inherent representations in the human brain [ Filbey et al . , 2012 ; Jiang et al . , 2015 ] .
__label__1 Similar to the cannabis cues , we presented participants with their self‐selected fruit stimulus based on the their response to “ what is your preferred fruit ? ”
__label__1 In the users , fourteen chose a banana , twelve chose an apple , thirteen chose an orange , and thirteen chose grapes .
__label__1 In the non‐users , sixteen selected a banana , seventeen selected an apple , fifteen selected an orange , and twenty selected grapes .
__label__1 Lastly , similar to the original task , a pencil was used as a neutral cue for all of the participants .
__label__1 Stimulus presentations were delivered using E‐Prime ( Psychology Software Tools ) .
__label__1 The timing of the stimulus presentation was synchronized with trigger pulses from the magnet to ensure precise temporal integration of stimulus presentation and fMRI data acquisition . fMRI Data Analysis Pre‐processing The functional imaging time series was pre‐processed using SPM8 ( Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience , London , UK ) .
__label__1 Before starting analyses , the first seven volumes of each EPI run were discarded to allow the MR signal to reach steady state .
__label__1 Pre‐processing of these volumes started with motion correction using SPM's realignment module [ Friston et al . , 1995 ] .
__label__1 This was followed by slice timing correction , which corrected for temporal differences in acquisition time of the BOLD signal across slices within each volume .
__label__1 The resultant time series was then smoothed using a 6 mm full width half maximum ( FWHM ) Gaussian kernel .
__label__1 First‐level analyses Preprocessed time series for each participant were analyzed using multiple linear regression as implemented in FILM ( FMRIB's Improved Linear Model ) , a component of FSL .
__label__1 Regressors for the linear model were generated using FEAT by convolving the cue states ( Cue Present , Craving Rating , Cue Washout ) of each cue type ( cannabis cues , neutral object cues and fruit cues ) with a double gamma hemodynamic response function .
__label__1 Parameter estimates for the regressors were used to generate z‐maps based on three contrasts of interest : Cue ON cannabis versus Cue ON neutral object ; Cue ON cannabis versus Cue ON fruit ; and Cue ON fruit versus Cue ON neutral object .
__label__0 Group level analyses Participant contrast maps were registered to their own MRI T1 weighted MPRAGE structural images , and then co‐registered to the MNI 152 template space using FLIRT ( FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool ) .
__label__1 Group analysis of contrasts was performed in FEAT using FLAME ( FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects ) to estimate a mixed effects model of task‐related activation differences for each of the three contrasts of interest ( as a Gaussianized t / F statistic ) .
__label__1 Groups were defined by cannabis usage status ( user / non‐user ) .
__label__1 Contrast maps were generated for each usage status .
__label__1 Resulting maps were height‐thresholded at a Z‐value of 2.3 .
__label__1 We used FEAT's cluster‐thresholding method , which estimated activated clusters ’ significance level ( from Gaussian random field theory ) compared with the cluster probability threshold [ Worsley et al . , 1996 ] ) of P ≤ 0.05 .
__label__1 Because a height‐threshold of z = 2.3 may result in large clusters despite adequately controlling for false‐positives , we also used a cluster defining voxel threshold of P ≤ 0.001 per recommendations by Woo et al . [ 2014 ] for the enhancement of anatomical specificity .
__label__1 In addition to simple group level maps , within the cannabis users , group level contrasts were generated for several variables of interest .
__label__1 To determine the relationship between the neural response in brain areas and subjective craving , group maps were regressed separately against total MCQ scores ( baseline craving ) and in‐scanner cannabis craving ratings .
__label__1 To determine if the neural response in brain areas are modulated by cannabis use behavior , group maps were regressed separately against reported grams of cannabis use per day and THC / creatinine levels from the abstinent state .
__label__1 To determine the clinical relevance of the neural response to cannabis cues , group maps were regressed separately against MWC scores and MPS scores .
__label__1 We expected positive associations between neural response to cues and subjective craving , cannabis use behavior and clinical symptoms of CUD .
__label__0 A Robust Sparse-Modeling Framework for Estimating Schizophrenia Biomarkers from fMRI Background Our goal is to identify the brain regions most relevant to mental illness using neuroimaging .
__label__1 State of the art machine learning methods commonly suffer from repeatability difficulties in this application , particularly when using large and heterogeneous populations for samples .
__label__1 New Method We revisit both dimensionality reduction and sparse modeling , and recast them in a common optimization-based framework .
__label__1 This allows us to combine the benefits of both types of methods in an approach which we call unambiguous components .
__label__1 We use this to estimate the image component with a constrained variability , which is best correlated with the unknown disease mechanism .
__label__0 Results We apply the method to the estimation of neuroimaging biomarkers for schizophrenia , using task fMRI data from a large multi-site study .
__label__1 The proposed approach yields an improvement in both robustness of the estimate and classification accuracy .
__label__1 Comparison with Existing Methods We find that unambiguous components incorporate roughly two thirds of the same brain regions as sparsity-based methods LASSO and elastic net , while roughly one third of the selected regions differ .
__label__1 Further , unambiguous components achieve superior classification accuracy in differentiating cases from controls .
__label__1 Conclusions Unambiguous components provide a robust way to estimate important regions of imaging data . 1 .
__label__0 Materials and Methods We will consider the linear model Ax = b + n where A is a m × n data matrix with n > m , containing samples as rows , and variables as columns ; b is the phenotype encoded into a vector of labels such as case or control ; the solution x is the unknown model parameters that relate A to b ; and n is a noise vector about which we have only statistical information .
__label__1 We will also assume the means have been removed from b and the columns of A to simplify the presentation .
__label__1 The rows of A are provided by the contrast images from individual study subjects , so a predictor x selects a weighted combination of voxels ( i.e . , columns of A ) which relates the imagery to the case-control status .
__label__1 By examining the weightings in this combination we hope to learn more about the spatial distribution of causes or effects of the disease , which we will term the “ mechanism ” in this paper .
__label__1 The model is depicted in Fig . 1 ( a ) , where we depict the true solution x as the mechanism whereby brain activity relates to the measured phenotypes .
__label__1 Of course there are far more unknown variables than samples , hence our linear system is underdetermined and there will be many possible x which solve the system .
__label__1 One way to address this problem is to impose prior knowledge about the biological mechanism , such as a preference for sparser x , and select the solution which best fulfills this preference .
__label__1 We will review this approach in a later section .
__label__1 Another approach is to restrict our analysis to components of the solution which may be more easily estimated , such as via dimensionality reduction ; an intuitive example of this approach is to group voxels into low-resolution regions .
__label__1 These alternatives are depicted in Fig . 1 ( b ) , as extremes on a continuum of possible methods , where the goal of this paper is to find intermediate information which utilizes the benefits of both extremes . 2.1 .
__label__1 Dimensionality Reduction To see how dimensionality reduction can apply to the estimation of mechanism , consider the Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) of A = USVT , where S is a diagonal matrix of singular values σi , and U and V contain the left and right singular vectors ui and vi .
__label__1 In Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) the focus is on this expansion itself , however our focus here is on the mechanism which we model by x .
__label__1 If we plug USVT into Ax = b and apply the transformation UT to both sides , we get a diagonalized system with decoupled equations of the form .
__label__1 This equation tell us that , while we can't calculate the true x in the underdetermined case , we can calculate components of x corresponding to nonzero singular values .
__label__1 One way to view this property is by considering that these components are constant for all possible x given our linear system .
__label__1 In other words , calculates the same value for any solution in the set { x | Ax = b } .
__label__1 In terms of our application , this means while we can't identify the true mechanism x , we can extract reliable components of it .
__label__1 For example , we might be able to coarsely identify large regions containing important activity , without being able to pinpoint particular voxels within those regions .
__label__1 Of course the SVD selects vectors based on orthogonal directions of ranked data variation , which may not be best suited to provide information about the disease mechanism .
__label__1 We will address this later by optimizing the choice of component , but first we will formally consider this property of constant components so that we may extend it later to incorporate prior knowledge . 2.2 .
__label__1 Unambiguous Components without Prior Knowledge In this section we will introduce the idea of unambiguous components in the noise-free case without prior knowledge .
__label__1 The concept is demonstrated geometrically in Fig . 2 ( a ) , where the useful information in A forms the matrix rowspace ; this contains the dimensions over which we have a diversity of data which we can compare to the phenotype b .
__label__1 Dimensions perpendicular to the rowspace form the nullspace , directions over which our data does not vary .
__label__1 For example if our dataset was composed of subjects with the same age , then we cannot perform a regression to see how disease risk relates to age .
__label__1 In terms of components of the data , if c is a loading vector and ai is a sample ( row of A ) , then cTai is potentially useful information when c is in the rowspace , and useless information ( in fact always zero ) when c is in the nullspace .
__label__1 An equivalent perspective , depicted in Fig . 2 ( b ) , is the geometry of the solution set to the regression model .
__label__1 This is the affine set SEC , composed of an offset ( the least-length solution x0 ) plus a vector from the nullspace .
__label__1 The subscript “ EC ” refers to x being only equality-constrained ( i.e . , we have imposed no prior knowledge yet ) .
__label__1 The rowspace vectors yield estimable components of x given the data , while nullspace vectors give the dimensions of ambiguity we have about x .
__label__1 We will formulate this relationship rigorously next .
__label__1 Recall that the rowspace of A is defined as the set of all possible linear combinations of rows , i.e . , .
__label__1 We can equivalently view this as a set whose members take on a constant value over SEC .
__label__1 In other words , they form the set of unambiguous components for SEC .
__label__1 We state this simple but important fact in Theorem 1 .
__label__1 Theorem 1 . cTx = μ for all x ∈ SEC , where μ is a constant .
__label__1 The following two statements are equivalent : Proof It is straightforward to note that , as ATy = c , we have cTx = yTAx = yTb ≡ μ .
__label__1 However it will be useful to our subsequent extension to note the fact that the rows-pace is the orthogonal complement to the nullspace , and can be also written as .
__label__1 Equivalently , any vector z in the nullspace may be described as a difference between solutions , i.e . , z = x1 – x2 , where x1 , x2 ∈ SEC .
__label__1 Therefore the rowspace may also be written as , which explicitly states the equivalence in Theorem 1 .
__label__1 The principal components of A corresponding to the r nonzero singular values must be in the rowspace .
__label__1 Again , given a singular-value decomposition A = USVT , we have VSUTy = c for , and hence , where the ui for i ∈ { 1 , . . . , r } form a basis for the rowspace .
__label__1 So principal components are unambiguous components .
__label__1 Later we will also consider how to optimize the choice of component such that it also computes a score which is maximally useful for an application ( such as to identify important image regions for classification of disease ) .
__label__1 But first we will extend the concept of unambiguous components to incorporate prior knowledge .
__label__1 Our focus on components of the mechanism x rather than of the data ai allows us to incorporate prior knowledge which applies to x into the method , such as the presumption of a sparse biological mechanism .
__label__1 In effect , we will utilize prior knowledge to further restrict the variation in x and potentially increase the estimable components of x . 2.3 .
__label__1 LASSO and Elastic Net In this section we will review closely-related estimation methods which utilize prior knowledge , to provide an intuitive basis for our mathematical formulation .
__label__1 The Maximum A Posteriori ( MAP ) estimate xMAP is the solution which maximizes the posterior probability P ( x | b ) over x .
__label__1 Using Bayes ’ theorem , we can form the equivalent problem , arg maxx P ( b | x ) P ( x ) , which utilizes the likelihood P ( b | x ) ( essentially the distribution for n ) , and the prior probability distribution P ( x ) .
__label__1 It is the form of this prior distribution which we refer to as the prior knowledge .
__label__1 A common approach is to take the log of this objective to get a penalized regression problem .
__label__1 With a Gaussian distribution for n and a Laplace distribution for x , taking the log yields the most well-known version of LASSO , .
__label__1 LASSO was originally proposed in the form , subject to , with the other version sometimes described as the Lagrangian form .
__label__1 It can be shown that for any λ , a α1 exists such that these optimization problems have the same minimizer , x1 .
__label__1 We can similarly form the feasibility problem ( an optimization problem which stops when any feasible point is found , hence we simply use a zero for the objective as it is irrelevant ) , In this paper we will focus on sets of the general form of this feasible set we will denote as SDR .
__label__1 In terms of the statistical distributions , the constraints on the norms amount to constraints on the probabilities , as in The subscript DR refers to the combination of denoising and regularization constraints .
__label__1 It can also be shown that x1 which solves the previous versions , will provide a member of this set .
__label__1 Therefore , we may write the LASSO problem as The elastic net can be viewed as a variation on LASSO , where ( under the Bayesian framework ) the Laplace prior distribution for the prior is replaced by a product of Laplace and Gaussian distributions .
__label__1 Taking the log of the posterior distribution leads to the well-known problem .
__label__1 As with LASSO , we may achieve the same solution using different optimization problems .
__label__1 We wish to use the same constraints as earlier , so we form the related problem , Recall that LASSO seeks any single solution within SDR .
__label__1 In that case , α1 and α2 are chosen as small as possible so the set is ( hopefully ) a singleton .
__label__1 Elastic net , on the other hand , seeks the least length solution in SDR , where we may choose α1 and α2 more loosely , to trade-off desirable properties of this solution .
__label__1 These are depicted in Fig . 2 ( d ) , where the LASSO solution , x1 is formed by tightening the bounds on the two sets ( one representing the prior and one representing the noise ) to minimal intersection .
__label__1 The elastic net solution , by contrast , relaxes the constraints on the two sets forming the larger set SDR , and selection of the least length solution in this intersection .
__label__1 Next we will extend the unambiguous component idea to utilize SDR , thereby incorporating prior knowledge into the framework .
__label__1 Finally , note that the norms ∥ · ∥ 1 and ∥ · ∥ 2 may be replaced with other choices of norms representing other forms of prior knowledge , such as the ℓ ∞ - norm , which imposes hard limits on the unknowns or the error , and which might result from box constraints or a minimax regression .
__label__1 More complex forms of penalties are used in the elastic net , and methods utilizing mixed norms such as group LASSO .
__label__1 The methods and theoretical results in this paper are generally the same as long as the choice fulfills the mathematical properties of a norm ( though this is not a strict requirement ) . 2.4 .
__label__1 Unambiguous Components Subject to Prior Knowledge Earlier , we introduced unambiguous components as components of the unknown solution , which computed a constant score over all possible solutions .
__label__1 Now we will extend this concept to replace the set of possible solutions ( SEC ) with a set of highly-probable solutions , for which we will use SDR .
__label__1 We will also extend the requirement that the score be constant to a requirement that their variation is limited within a fixed bound .
__label__1 So in effect , given a pool of solutions , which we may view as the most likely hypotheses for the underlying mechanism , we will seek components which compute approximately-constant scores for every likely mechanism .
__label__1 We incorporate prior knowledge as well as bounds on the score by relaxing the rowspace with the following generalization , Here we have relaxed the ambiguity to potentially allow a positive bound ϵ , as well as replaced SEC with SDR .
__label__1 Note that we were able to remove the absolute value in Eq . ( 8 ) because membership in RS ( ϵ ) requires the inequality hold for all x1 , x2 ∈ SDR , hence if it holds for , , it must also hold for , where and .
__label__1 To highlight the view of this set as a generalization of the rowspace , we state the following simple generalization of Theorem 1 , without proof , Theorem 2 c ∈ RS ( ϵ ) for all x ∈ SDR , where μ is a constant .
__label__1 The following two statements are equivalent : Note that while this formulation appears quite simple , it will generally not be possible to describe RS ( ϵ ) in a closed form or analytically determine whether a vector is a member of RS ( ϵ ) .
__label__1 However we may use convex optimization theory to formulate RS ( ϵ ) as a system of inequalities .
__label__1 We defined RS ( ϵ ) via the test cTx1 – cTx2 ≤ ϵ , which may also be written as cT ( x1 – x2 ) ≤ ϵ .
__label__1 We may use optimization to directly perform this test as follows , If the optimal value p ≤ ϵ , then we were unable to find any pair of solutions to demonstrate an ambiguity in the component score greater than ϵ , and hence c ∈ Rs ( ϵ ) .
__label__1 Similar methods have been proposed elsewhere to use optimization to test boundedness and uniqueness of solutions to systems with particular forms of prior knowledge ; in those cases the test was performed over individual variables , whereas we will use a test for a general component c here .
__label__1 SDR is a convex set so this is a straightforward convex optimization problem for either maximization or minimization , and so we can be assured of finding a global optima with an efficient algorithm .
__label__1 If we replace SDR with SEC we have the equality-constrained linear program , Unless c is in the rowspace of A , this optimization problem will be unbounded .
__label__1 So the optimality condition for Eq . ( 10 ) is the now-familiar requirement that a solution can be found to ATy = c .
__label__1 It is not useful to relax the ambiguity in the equality-constrained case ( there , p is either zero or infinite ) , but for SDR we can form general conditions for c ∈ RS ( ϵ ) incorporating a relaxed upper limit p ≤ ϵ .
__label__1 The analogous set of conditions achieved using SDR instead of SEC , and allowing a non-zero ϵ , is the following , as we will show with Theorem 3 , This is the generalization of the rowspace condition ATy = c to RS ( ϵ ) .
__label__1 We show this with the following theorem , Theorem 3 If there exists a y , y ′ , λ1 , λ2 and such that c is a solution to Eqs . ( 11 ) , then c ∈ Rs ( ϵ ) .
__label__1 Proof We can test the limits of cTx with the optimization problem of Eq . ( 9 ) with S = SDR , By forming the dual of the optimization problem in Eq . ( 12 ) , we can get an upper bound on the optimal .
__label__1 The dual optimization problem is where ∥ · ∥ * is the dual norm of ∥ · ∥ .
__label__1 For example the dual norm for the ℓ1 - norm is the ℓ ∞ - norm ( we provide this general result to allow for other choices of norms if desired ) .
__label__1 The weak duality condition , which always holds , tells us that p ≤ d .
__label__1 By constraining the objective of Eq . ( 13 ) to be bounded by ϵ , which would mean c ∈ RS ( ϵ ) , we get the conditions of Eqs . ( 11 ) .
__label__1 Note that strong duality holds for convex optimization problems as well as many non-convex problems under a broad set of conditions , the most well-known being Slater's condition .
__label__1 When strong duality holds , the converse of Theorem 3 holds as well , and so our conditions hold for all elements of RS ( ϵ ) .
__label__1 We will presume this is the case .
__label__1 Next we will consider the choice of useful components which fulfill the conditions of Eqs . ( 11 ) . 2.5 .
__label__1 Optimizing Components The motivation and strategy of our approach are summarized in Fig . 3 .
__label__1 For a hypothetical example , we give several potential solutions to Ax = b which we denote as x ( i ) , where Ax ( i ) = b for all i .
__label__1 Recall each solution is a potential mechanism .
__label__1 For example , potential solution x ( 1 ) suggests the mechanism is based on activity at voxel k2 , while potential solution x ( 4 ) suggests the mechanism is based on activity at voxel k1 .
__label__1 Choosing any single solution such as the MAP solution is risky as it may lead us to the wrong voxel if incorrect .
__label__1 We can analyze the risk of a choice of solution by looking at its correlation with other high-probability solutions .
__label__1 If we treat the choice of solution as an alternative candidate for a component , we may equivalently evaluate this risk by examining the marginal distribution of the score computed by this component .
__label__1 In Fig . 3 we depict multiple options for components ; c ( 1 ) is the MAP solution , while c ( 2 ) calculates the an average over a large region .
__label__1 Fig . 3 also gives the distributions for the scores computed by these components ( i.e . , the range of correlations with potential solutions ) , where we see that these two result in broad distributions .
__label__1 Such broad distributions imply a wide possible variation in correlation with the different possible solutions , meaning these components are not very unambiguous , and hence are poor representatives of the set of high-probability solutions .
__label__1 Our strategy is depicted in Fig . 3 by the distribution for P ( c * Tx ) , where we set desired limits on the spread of the correlations , and use optimization to choose an optimal c * which fulfills these requirements .
__label__1 We can implement this strategy , therefore , using the conditions we derived in the previous section , recalling the relationship between the constraint sets and the distributions of Eq . ( 4 ) .
__label__1 Further , in order to choose the unambiguous component which is most useful for identifying properties of the mechanism , not only do we seek a component which is unambiguous , we also wish for the correlation with potential solutions to be maximized .
__label__1 To motivate this approach , consider the following robust strategy .
__label__1 Suppose instead of seeking an unambiguous component , we simply sought a component which had high correlations with all possible x ∈ SDR using the following minimax strategy , Here we seek the c for which the worst-possible correlation with high-probability solutions x ∈ SDR is maximized .
__label__1 If we exchange the maximization and minimization to get minxϵSDRmax ∥ c ∥ = 1 cTx , then we can analytically solve the inner maximization to get minx ∈ SDR ∥ x ∥ 2 , which is a variation on the elastic net of Eq . ( 6 ) .
__label__1 So the elastic net can be viewed as a robust strategy to choose a vector c which maximizes the worst-case correlation with possible mechanisms , defined by SDR .
__label__1 For an unambiguous component , the correlations cTx will be approximately equal for all x ∈ SDR by design .
__label__1 Therefore , we can simply choose an unambiguous component with maximum correlation using the following optimization ( which we will call the UMAX problem , for Unambiguous Maximum correlation ) , where x̂ is any solution in SDR , such as the LASSO solution x1 .
__label__1 We also relaxed the unit length constraint to an inequality constraint ∥ c ∥ ≤ 1 , making the optimization convex .
__label__1 In the extreme case where SDR is small and only contains close approximations to x1 , the optimal c will converge to x1 .
__label__1 Optimization also provides an opportunity to impose additional properties on the component vector c .
__label__1 In particular , we may independently impose sparsity of our component ( not to be confused with the sparsity prior which applies to the mechanism ) .
__label__1 In Eq . ( 16 ) , we trade o a degree of sparsity on c and correlation with the mechanism , based on a choice of regularization parameter η .
__label__1 For comparison , the following provides a similar optimization without the imposition of prior knowledge , This component is simply the best choice according to our heuristic which can be found within the rowspace .
__label__1 Techniques which select combinations of principal components such as sparse PCA or supervised PCA , essentially form a variation of Eq . ( 17 ) . 3 .
__label__0 Dopamine-related disruption of functional topography of striatal connections in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia Importance Despite the well-established role of striatal dopamine in psychosis , current views generally agree that cortical dysfunction is likely necessary for the emergence of psychotic symptoms .
__label__0 The topographical organization of striatal-cortical connections is central to gating and integration of higher-order information , so a disruption of such topography via dysregulated dopamine could lead to cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia .
__label__1 However , this hypothesis remains to be tested using multivariate methods ascertaining the global pattern of striatal connectivity and without the confounding effects of anti-dopaminergic medication .
__label__0 Objective To determine whether the pattern of brain connectivity across striatal subregions is abnormal in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia , and whether this abnormality relates to psychotic symptoms and extrastriatal dopaminergic transmission .
__label__0 Design and Participants In this multimodal , case-control study , we obtained resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) data in 18 unmedicated patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy controls .
__label__0 A subset of these ( 12 and 17 , respectively ) underwent Positron Emission Tomographic ( PET ) imaging with the dopamine D2 - receptor radiotracer [ 11C ] FLB457 , before and after amphetamine .
__label__1 Data were acquired between June 16 , 2011 , and February 25 , 2014 .
__label__0 Main Outcomes ( 1 ) Group differences in the striatal connectivity pattern ( assessed via multivariable logistic regression ) across striatal subregions , and the relationship between the multivariate striatal connectivity pattern ( 2 ) with extrastriatal baseline D2 - receptor binding potential and its change following amphetamine ( BPND and ΔBPND ) , and ( 3 ) with severity of positive symptoms evaluated with the PANSS scale .
__label__1 Results Patients exhibited an abnormal pattern of striatal connectivity , which included abnormal caudate connections with a distributed set of associative cortex regions ( p = 0.0036 ) .
__label__1 In patients , more deviation from the multivariate pattern of striatal connectivity found in controls correlated specifically with more severe positive symptoms ( p = 0.0021 ) .
__label__1 Striatal connectivity also correlated with baseline BPND across cortical and extrastriatal subcortical regions ( p = 0.0116 , Bonferroni-corrected ) but not with ΔBPND .
__label__0 Conclusions and Relevance Using a multimodal , circuit-level interrogation of striatal-cortical connections , we provide a first demonstration that the functional topography of these connections is globally disrupted in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia .
__label__1 These findings suggest that striatal-cortical dysconnectivity may underlie the effects of dopamine dysregulation on the pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms .
__label__0 Here , we investigated the pattern of resting-state functional connectivity across subregions of the striatum in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls using a multivariate approach .
__label__1 Our main aims were to test ( 1 ) whether the functional topography of striatal connections is altered in schizophrenia , and whether such abnormalities correlate with ( 2 ) severity of psychotic symptoms and with ( 3 ) amphetamine-induced dopamine release and D2 receptor ( D2R ) density .
__label__0 METHODS Participants Unmedicated patients with schizophrenia ( n = 19 ) and healthy controls ( n = 24 ) were recruited at New York State Psychiatric Institute ( NYSPI ) and through advertisements .
__label__1 All participants provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the NYSPI and Yale University .
__label__1 Inclusion criteria for healthy controls were : absence of ( 1 ) any DSM-IV Axis-I diagnosis and of ( 2 ) psychotic illness in first-degree relatives .
__label__1 Inclusion criteria for patients were : ( 1 ) lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia , schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder ( based on the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies and consensus diagnosis ) ; ( 2 ) no antipsychotics for 3 weeks before study enrollment ; ( 3 ) no violent behavior .
__label__1 Common exclusion criteria were significant medical illnesses , misuse of substances other than nicotine , positive urine drug screen , pregnancy and nursing .
__label__0 PET and task-based fMRI data on 28 of the 42 subjects was previously published .
__label__0 Symptom severity was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms ( SAPS ) , and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) .
__label__1 The Hollingshead scale , the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery were also obtained .
__label__0 Resting-state fMRI data acquisition Participants completed 2 runs of 165 volumes each on a Philips 1.5T scanner .
__label__1 They were instructed to relax and keep their eyes open .
__label__1 Participants were spoken to before and after each sequence to ensure wakefulness .
__label__1 Whole-brain functional echo-planar images were obtained using an 8 - channel coil ( 3 - mm isotropic voxels ; eMethods ) . fMRI preprocessing Preprocessing followed standard procedures in SPM8 and ‘ scrubbing ’ procedures for resting-state fMRI ( eMethods ) .
__label__1 ‘ Scrubbing ’ cutoffs were established based on a larger dataset for two indices of motion-related data quality reflecting the rate of change in brain-wide signal ( DVARS ) and total instantaneous framewise displacement ( FD ) , respectively .
__label__1 One patient was excluded due to excessive motion .
__label__1 Temporal band-pass filtering , spatial smoothing , and voxelwise z-scoring of time series were applied .
__label__0 Region-of-interest ( ROI ) definition Striatal and extrastriatal ROIs were manually drawn on individual T1 - weighted scans as defined previously .
__label__1 The striatum was divided into 5 subregions : ( 1 ) ventral striatum , ( 2 ) anterior ( pre-commissural ) caudate , ( 3 ) posterior ( post-commissural ) caudate , ( 4 ) anterior putamen , and ( 5 ) posterior putamen .
__label__0 Unsmoothed fMRI data from each subregion was averaged across the containing voxels ( collapsing across hemispheres ; eMethods ) and z-scored to construct seed timeseries .
__label__1 Extracting the first eigenvariate instead of the mean yielded almost identical results , indicating high functional homogeneity within subregions .
__label__1 Ipsilateral and contralateral connectivity were highly consistent within subregions ( Supplement ) . fMRI data analysis Subject-level analyses consisted of a Generalized Linear Model ( GLM ) in SPM8 including the following regressors : ( 1 – 5 ) spatially averaged timeseries for each of the 5 striatal subregions ( seeds ) , ( 6 – 7 ) timeseries for white-matter and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) regions-of-no-interest ( eMethods ) , ( 8 – 19 ) six head motion ( realignment ) parameters and their first derivatives ( all band-pass filtered ) , and ( 20 – 21 ) run and global intercepts .
__label__1 One dummy variable was additionally included to censor each artifactual set of adjacent volumes exceeding either the DVARS or FD cutoffs .
__label__1 The resulting regression coefficient ( beta ) maps for each striatal subregion , representing connection strengths for each brain voxel with one striatal subregion while controlling for the other four ( and the nuisance variables ) , were used subsequently .
__label__1 Multivariate fMRI analyses Our primary goal was to test whether the overall pattern of striatal connectivity predicted group membership using logistic regression .
__label__1 We used a multivariate approach rather than univariate analyses because the latter can only test connectivity between individual seeds and target regions but not the overall ( multivariate ) pattern of connectivity across seeds .
__label__1 Our purpose in using logistic regression , however , was not as a diagnostic classifier , but rather as a test of multivariate differences in connectivity .
__label__1 Exploratory analyses ( Supplement ) used a multivariate recursive-feature-elimination support-vector-machine ( RFE-SVM ) classifier for the former purpose .
__label__1 First , whole-brain connectivity beta maps for each striatal subregion were parcellated into Brodmann areas ( BAs ) and subcortical nuclei using the Tailarach Daemon atlas in the WFU PickAtlas toolbox ( henceforth referred to as target regions ) , after excluding striatal voxels .
__label__1 Second , a data-reduction step retained only target regions exhibiting significant connectivity with any of the striatal subregions ( p ≤ 0.005 , uncorrected , in ≥ 20% of the voxels ) in either group ; 29 regions met these criteria ( for individual striatal subregions 1 – 5 the number of target regions to meet criteria were 0 , 24 , 2 , 5 , and 4 , respectively ) .
__label__1 Although these selection criteria were unbiased towards any subregion , they yielded more target regions for the anterior caudate given its stronger widespread connectivity .
__label__1 Next , logistic regression was used to predict group membership based on connection strengths for striatal-target pairs ( i.e . , individual mean connectivity betas for each target region by striatal subregion ) .
__label__1 Because including all pairs each as a predictor variable would result in an underdetermined model , we used model building with step-forward selection to progressively include sets of predictor variables , with each of five possible sets consisting of all connectivity betas for target regions significantly associated with a given striatal subregion .
__label__1 First , models consisting of predictors from one set at a time were analyzed , and the set resulting in the lowest p-value was retained .
__label__1 Additional sets of variables were retained in the model if they significantly improved the model fit ( p < 0.05 , likelihood-ratio test ) .
__label__1 The likelihood-ratio test for the final model was our a priori test of group differences in connectivity patterns ( other p-values were only used for data-reduction and model-building steps ) .
__label__1 Once the final model was determined , the subject-wise predicted log odds of belonging to the healthy group based on the multivariate connectivity pattern was used as a summary index of degree of abnormality in the striatal connectivity pattern for further correlational analyses with clinical and PET data ( note that these analyses were unbiased as the ordering of the log odds across individuals was orthogonal to all clinical and PET data except for group membership , which was controlled for appropriately ; eMethods ) .
__label__1 These correlational analyses used parametric tests except when the data were not normally distributed ( based on a Lilliefors test ) , in which case non-parametric tests were used .
__label__0 Spearman ’ s rank ( partial ) correlations were used to assess the relationship between connectivity and severity of positive symptoms within patients , based on the PANSS positive-subscale-total scores ( PANSS-PT ) , while controlling for negative symptoms as measured by the PANSS negative-subscale-total scores ( PANSS-NT ) .
__label__0 Robust multiple linear regression ( iteratively-reweighted least squares with bisquare-weighting function ) was used to assess the relationship between connectivity and PET data ( baseline BPND or ΔBPND , see below ) across all participants while controlling for group and nuisance variables .
__label__1 Spearman rank correlations were used for exploratory analyses of the MATRICS composite score .
__label__1 Effects surviving a p-value of 0.05 are reported .
__label__1 Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used when necessary .
__label__1 Finally , the number of artifactual volumes regressed out for each participant was also used as an fMRI-data-quality score .
__label__1 PET preprocessing and data analysis A detailed description of PET procedures and results was previously published .
__label__1 Participants underwent two PET scans with the D2 radiotracer [ 11C ] FLB457 on an Siemens HR + scanner at Yale University : a baseline scan and a second scan 3 h after oral administration of amphetamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) .
__label__1 Arterial plasma was collected to form metabolite-corrected input functions .
__label__1 Kinetic modeling used a two-tissue compartment model that incorporated a set of shared parameter estimates across predefined ROIs .
__label__1 Binding potential ( BPND ) and its relative change from baseline following amphetamine ( ΔBPND ) were estimated in each ROI excluding the striatum – striatal BPND cannot be quantified with [ 11C ] FLB457 due to its slow washout in this high D2R density region .
__label__1 Both BPND and ΔBPND values were highly correlated across regions ( mean r ~ 0.8 ) .
__label__1 Thus , as a data-reduction step we performed principal component analyses ( PCA ) with varimax rotation , separately for BPND and ΔBPND , across regions .
__label__1 Horn ’ s parallel analyses yielded a 1 - factor solution for baseline BPND ( corresponding to D2R density across all regions ) and a 1 - factor solution for ΔBPND ( corresponding to dopamine release across all regions ) .
__label__1 For correlational analyses , individual factor scores were calculated as the weighted sum of factor loadings by the PET measures ( BPND or ΔBPND ) across ROIs .
__label__1 A KCNJ6 gene polymorphism modulates theta oscillations during reward processing Event related oscillations ( EROs ) are heritable measures of neurocognitive function that have served as useful phenotype in genetic research .
__label__1 A recent family genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) by the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism ( COGA ) found that theta EROs during visual target detection were associated at genome-wide levels with several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , including a synonymous SNP , rs702859 , in the KCNJ6 gene that encodes GIRK2 , a G-protein inward rectifying potassium channel that regulates excitability of neuronal networks .
__label__1 The present study examined the effect of the KCNJ6 SNP ( rs702859 ) , previously associated with theta ERO to targets in a visual oddball task , on theta EROs during reward processing in a monetary gambling task .
__label__0 The participants were 1,601 adolescent and young adult offspring within the age-range of 17 – 25 years ( 800 males and 801 females ) from high-dense alcoholism families as well as control families of the COGA prospective study .
__label__1 Theta ERO power ( 3.5 – 7.5 Hz , 200 – 500 ms post-stimulus ) was compared across genotype groups .
__label__1 ERO theta power at central and parietal regions increased as a function of the minor allele ( A ) dose in the genotype ( AA > AG > GG ) in both loss and gain conditions .
__label__1 These findings indicate that variations in the KCNJ6 SNP influence magnitude of theta oscillations at posterior loci during the evaluation of loss and gain , reflecting a genetic influence on neuronal circuits involved in reward-processing .
__label__1 Increased theta power as a function of minor allele dose suggests more efficient cognitive processing in those carrying the minor allele of the KCNJ6 SNPs .
__label__1 Future studies are needed to determine the implications of these genetic effects on posterior theta EROs as possible “ protective ” factors , or as indices of delays in brain maturation ( i.e . , lack of frontalization ) . 1 .
__label__0 Methods 2.1 .
__label__1 Sample The sample consisted of 1,601 participants ( 800 males and 801 females ) between 17 and 25 years of age from the prospective sample of the COGA study .
__label__0 The participants were offspring from families ascertained in previous phases of COGA : ( 1 ) multiplex alcohol dependent families ( AD ) , many with multiple alcoholism-affected family members , and ( 2 ) community comparison families ( CC ) drawn from the general population .
__label__1 Participants enter the study when they are between the ages of 12 – 22 and are reassessed every two years with age-appropriate clinical , behavioral and neurophysiological assessments .
__label__1 For additional details of the sample characteristics , see .
__label__1 For this study , participants within the age range of 17 – 25 years were selected ; each individual was represented only once in the sample , at their earliest assessment within this age range .
__label__1 The number of subjects in each subgroup is shown in Table 1 .
__label__1 The sample predominantly included participants with European ancestry ( EA : 65.08% ) and African ancestry ( AA : 32.29 ) , in addition to a small fraction with Hispanic ancestry ( HA : 2.62% ) .
__label__1 Data from six collection centers have been included in this study : SUNY Downstate Medical Center at Brooklyn , New York ; University of Connecticut Health Science Center ; Washington University School of Medicine in St .
__label__1 Louis ; University of California at San Diego ; University of Iowa , and Indiana University School of Medicine .
__label__1 Recruitment and assessment procedures have been described elsewhere and are also available at this website : https : / / zork5 . wustl.edu / coganew / data / instruments.html .
__label__1 Subjects were instructed to refrain from using alcohol and substances for at least 5 days prior to EEG recording .
__label__1 Subjects were excluded from neurophysiological assessment if they had any of the following : ( 1 ) recent substance or alcohol use ( i.e . , positive breath-analyzer test ) , ( 2 ) hepatic encephalopathy / cirrhosis of the liver , ( 3 ) history of head injury , seizures or neurosurgery , ( 4 ) uncorrected sensory deficits , ( 5 ) use of medication known to influence brain functioning , and ( 6 ) other acute / chronic medical illnesses that affects brain function . 2.2 .
__label__1 Monetary Gambling Task The monetary gambling task ( MGT ) used in this study is illustrated in Figure 1 .
__label__1 Each trial begins with a choice stimulus ( CS ) , with two numbers ( representing monetary values in US cents ) of 10 ( left box ) and 50 ( right box ) , displayed for 800 ms .
__label__1 The participants select a bet of either 50¢ or 10¢ , and receive feedback of either loss or gain for the selected amount ( outcome stimulus , OS ) .
__label__1 The task details have been described in our previous publications .
__label__1 The inter-stimulus interval between a CS and OS , and between an OS and the next CS is 1500 ms .
__label__1 The task involves a total of 172 trials , each with one of four possible outcomes : Loss 50 , Loss 10 , Gain 50 , and Gain 10 .
__label__1 The number of outcome events for loss / red and gain / green trials ( OS ) are equal ( i.e . , 50% loss and 50% gain trials regardless of the amount within each outcome ) , and the order of trial sequence is predetermined , pseudo-randomized , and identical for all participants .
__label__1 However , the participants are not aware of the probability or sequence of the trials .
__label__1 Although the loss and gain events are predetermined , the final outcome trials varied across the participants as they are free to choose either of the amounts in each trial . 2.3 .
__label__1 EEG Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Identical experimental procedures and EEG acquisition systems were used at all neurophysiology collection sites with high inter-laboratory consistency in recordings .
__label__1 Subjects were seated comfortably 1 meter from a monitor in a dimly lit sound-attenuated RF-shielded booth ( Industrial Acoustics , Inc . , Bronx , NY , USA ) , and wore a 61 - channel electrode cap ( Electro-Cap International , Inc . , Eaton , OH , USA ) based on the Extended 10 – 20 System ( Fig . 2 ) , with a reference electrode at the tip of the nose and with a ground electrode at the forehead .
__label__0 The electrooculogram ( EOG ) was recorded by a supraorbital vertical electrode and by a horizontal electrode on the external canthus of the left eye .
__label__1 Electrode impedances were maintained below 5 kΩ .
__label__1 Electrical activity was amplified 10,000 times using SynAmps2 amplifiers ( Compumedics USA , Charlotte , NC ) and was recorded continuously over a bandwidth between near-DC ( 0 Hz ) and 100.0 Hz on a Neuroscan system ( Versions 4.3 – 4.5 ; Compumedics USA , Charlotte , NC ) at a sampling rate of 500 Hz .
__label__0 The EEG data were resampled offline to 256 Hz for the analyses .
__label__1 Then the waveforms were bandpass filtered offline with 0.05 Hz ( low pass ) and 55 Hz ( high pass ) .
__label__1 EOG correction procedures were not applied .
__label__1 However , the trials with waveforms exceeding ± 100 µV ( primarily due to eye movement artifacts ) and other artifacts ( e.g . , low frequency ( DC ) drifts and shifts and high frequency noise above 50 Hz ) were excluded from the analyses .
__label__1 EROs were extracted from the trial epochs of outcome stimuli ( 1000 ms post stimulus ) which contained the feedback of either loss or gain condition ( i.e . , the epochs following colored frames in Figure 1 ) .
__label__1 The ERO data for the subjects whose ERP waveforms were morphologically aberrant were also further removed from the analyses .
__label__1 Only the trials containing loss and gain conditions for the bigger amount ( 50¢ ) were analyzed in the current study , as our previous work showed topographic similarity of theta power for both amounts within loss and gain conditions and more trials for the 50¢ conditions .
__label__1 Each subject had a minimum of 15 artifact free trials for the ERO analyses . 2.4 .
__label__1 ERO Signal Processing using S-Transform Time-frequency ( TF ) data were derived using the S-transform signal processing method , introduced by .
__label__1 The S-transform has been explained in our previous papers .
__label__1 The S-transform is derived from short-time Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform , and has a greater flexibility , anti-noise performance , and utility in the processing of non-stationary and complex signals compared to other traditional methods , such as short-time Fourier transform and Wigner-Ville distribution .
__label__1 This method has been applied in several recent studies to analyze time-frequency signals of event-related oscillation .
__label__1 In the current study , total ERO theta power ( which is a combination of both phase-locked and non-phase-locked activity ) was computed from the outcome trials of the larger loss and gain conditions ( 50¢ ) .
__label__1 Specifically , theta power ( 3.5 – 7.5 Hz ) within the TFR corresponding to the 200 – 500 ms post-stimulus time window underlying both N2 and P3 components during ‘ loss 50 ’ and ‘ gain 50 ’ conditions was extracted at frontal ( F3 , FZ , F4 ) , central ( C3 , CZ , C4 ) , and parietal ( P3 , PZ , P4 ) regions .
__label__1 The average number of trials were 26.21 and 28.43 for the loss and gain condition , respectively . 2.5 .
__label__1 Genotyping Genotyping was performed at Washington University School of Medicine in St .
__label__1 Louis on an OpenArray platform , and at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis on the Sequenom MassArray system on a larger group of COGA subjects of which the sample described here is a subset .
__label__1 OpenArray genotyping is a multiplex TaqMan assay platform .
__label__1 The OpenArray Genotyping Plate Configurator was used to design assays .
__label__1 Arrays were scanned on the OpenArray NT imager and genotypes were called using the OpenArray SNP Genotyping analysis software .
__label__1 Sequenom Assays ( iPLEX Gold ) were designed using MassArray Assay Design Software ( Sequenom , San Diego , CA ) .
__label__1 Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) was computed separately in European Americans and African Americans , and cluster data were re-evaluated if HWE was significant at p < 0.05 .
__label__1 All SNPs were cleaned for Mendelian inheritance using PEDCHECK .
__label__1 SNP allele frequencies and heterozygosities were computed in PLINK using data on founders only included in the larger group .
__label__1 Ethnic stratification was assessed with SNPrelate using 64 ancestry-informative SNPs , as part of a larger 96 SNP panel developed at the Rutgers University DNA and Cell Repository ( RUID ™ ) .
__label__1 Further details on the genotyping data is available elsewhere .
__label__1 The KCNJ6 SNP assayed and used in this study , rs702859 , is a synonymous SNP in exon 4 found to be associated with theta EROs to target stimuli in a visual oddball task in our previous GWAS at a genome-wide level of significance .
__label__1 This SNP had the nucleotides ‘ A ’ ( adenine ) as the major allele and ‘ G ’ ( guanine ) as the minor allele , and the participants were classified into one of three genotype groups based on the number of minor allele ( s ) : 0 ( AA ) , 1 ( AG / GA ) , and 2 ( GG ) . 2.6 .
__label__1 Statistical Analyses Log-transformed ERO theta power , representing frontal ( F3 , FZ , F4 ) , central ( C3 , CZ , C4 ) , and parietal ( P3 , PZ , P4 ) electrodes , was compared across genotypes using repeated measures analysis of variance ( RM-ANOVA ) of the general linear model ( GLM ) by using ( i ) the genotype ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) as between subjects factor , ( ii ) task condition ( loss , gain ) and region ( frontal , central , parietal ) as within-subjects factors , and ( iii ) ethnic stratification ( PC1 , PC2 ) , age , gender , and family type as covariates in the model ( see Table 2 ) .
__label__1 RM-ANOVA results were extracted from the multivariate test statistics as the ERO data for the within-subjects factors did not adhere to sphericity assumptions ( i.e . , the equality of the variances of the differences between levels of the repeated measures factor such as region ) .
__label__1 In other words , an appropriate alternative for the sphericity assumption while analyzing the EEG data is to use multivariate tests within a repeated-measures design , as used in the current study .
__label__1 F-values and p-values of Pillai ’ s Trace were used .
__label__1 Further , on the figure illustrating the means of the EROs separated by genotype , region , and condition , the Bonferroni adjusted p-values of significant pairwise multiple comparisons have been provided [ see Fig . 3 ] . 3 .
__label__0 Acute D3 Antagonist GSK598809 Selectively Enhances Neural Response During Monetary Reward Anticipation in Drug and Alcohol Dependence Evidence suggests that disturbances in neurobiological mechanisms of reward and inhibitory control maintain addiction and provoke relapse during abstinence .
__label__1 Abnormalities within the dopamine system may contribute to these disturbances and pharmacologically targeting the D3 dopamine receptor ( DRD3 ) is therefore of significant clinical interest .
__label__0 We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the acute effects of the DRD3 antagonist GSK598809 on anticipatory reward processing , using the monetary incentive delay task ( MIDT ) , and response inhibition using the Go / No-Go task ( GNGT ) .
__label__0 A double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover design approach was used in abstinent alcohol dependent , abstinent poly-drug dependent and healthy control volunteers .
__label__1 For the MIDT , there was evidence of blunted ventral striatal response to reward in the poly-drug-dependent group under placebo .
__label__1 GSK598809 normalized ventral striatal reward response and enhanced response in the DRD3 - rich regions of the ventral pallidum and substantia nigra .
__label__1 Exploratory investigations suggested that the effects of GSK598809 were mainly driven by those with primary dependence on alcohol but not on opiates .
__label__1 Taken together , these findings suggest that GSK598809 may remediate reward deficits in substance dependence .
__label__1 For the GNGT , enhanced response in the inferior frontal cortex of the poly-drug group was found .
__label__1 However , there were no effects of GSK598809 on the neural network underlying response inhibition nor were there any behavioral drug effects on response inhibition .
__label__1 GSK598809 modulated the neural network underlying reward anticipation but not response inhibition , suggesting that DRD3 antagonists may restore reward deficits in addiction .
__label__0 In vitro studies demonstrate the highest density of DRD3s within the ventral striatum of the human brain , whereas in vivo human positron emission tomography ( PET ) studies demonstrated maximal DRD3 density within the ventral pallidum ( VP ) , followed by the substantia nigra ( SN ) and ventral striatum ( VS ) , with lower levels in thalamus and dorsal striatum .
__label__1 Exposure to drugs of abuse results in upregulation of DRD3 in rodent models of addiction .
__label__1 Upregulated DRD3 density has been found within the VS and SN in a postmortem study of cocaine dependence while upregulated nigral DRD3s correlated positively with impulsivity and risky decision making in stimulant dependence .
__label__1 Trends for upregulated ventral pallidal DRD3 have been found in both alcohol dependence and heavy stimulant use .
__label__1 Consequently , there is much interest in this receptor as a target for drug therapy .
__label__1 DRD3 antagonists have shown promise in preclinical studies , reducing self-administration , cue-induced drug-seeking , and conditioned place preference .
__label__1 In clinical populations , the novel DRD3 antagonist GSK598809 transiently reduced craving in nicotine dependence and attentional bias for food cues in low restrained eaters .
__label__1 The exact mechanism by which DRD3 antagonists achieve these effects is currently unknown , although there is evidence that the DRD3 is an autoreceptor controlling the synthesis and release of dopamine .
__label__1 Blockade of DRD3 with GSK598809 may therefore increase extra-synaptic dopamine .
__label__1 The ICCAM Platform study is a multicenter research study that aimed to ( 1 ) identify brain networks underlying addiction to alcohol , cocaine , and opiates and relapse vulnerability and ( 2 ) identify potential new treatments for addiction based on their ability to modulate these networks .
__label__0 Here we present the effects of GSK598809 on networks underlying the anticipation of reward , using the monetary incentive delay task ( MIDT ) and response inhibition using the Go / No-Go task ( GNGT ) .
__label__1 We hypothesized that reward and inhibitory control disturbances would be found in abstinent drug-dependent individuals and that GSK598809 would mitigate such disturbances .
__label__0 MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants Participants were recruited as part of the ICCAM multicenter study .
__label__0 Detailed description of recruitment and participant characteristics are described elsewhere .
__label__0 Briefly , substance-dependent individuals were recruited according to the following criteria : aged 20 – 64 years , meeting DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association , 2000 ) criteria for current or prior alcohol , cocaine or opiate dependence , abstinent for at least 4 weeks , free from any current primary axis - 1 mental health disorder , no history of severe enduring mental illness , no psychoactive medications , no serious physical health problems , no neurological disease , and no contraindications for MRI scanning .
__label__0 Healthy controls ( HC ) were recruited according to the same criteria except that they had no current or history of dependence to any drug except nicotine .
__label__0 Eighty-eight participants completed both placebo and GSK598809 sessions : a HC group ( n = 35 ) , an abstinent alcohol-dependent ( AD ) ( n = 20 ) and an abstinent poly-drug-dependent ( PD ) group ( n = 33 ) .
__label__1 Five people were excluded from the MID analysis , and 14 from the GNG analysis leaving final Ns of 83 and 74 , respectively ( see Supplementary Materials for details ) .
__label__1 The HC group was matched with the AD and PD groups for age , sex , smoking status , and handedness and additionally with the AD group , but not the PD group , for IQ and years of education ( see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ) .
__label__1 AD and PD groups differed significantly for age for the MID analysis , with a trend for a difference for the GNG analysis ( p = 0.06 ) .
__label__1 Procedures and Tasks Procedures are described in detail elsewhere .
__label__1 Briefly , the ICCAM study involved five separate scanning sessions ( one screening , including fMRI scanning to familiarize participants with the scanner environment and tasks , and four drug testing sessions ) .
__label__1 Placebo and GSK598809 ( 60 mg ) were administered in a double-blind manner with a crossover design .
__label__1 Owing to concerns over study dropout and loss of placebo data , a weighted randomization was used with the placebo session administered in study session 2 or 3 , whereas GSK598809 was administered in session 4 or 5 ( with the other two sessions testing other drugs as part of the ICCAM platform ) .
__label__1 The mean ( SD ) inter-session interval between placebo and GSK598809 sessions was 34.39 days ( 40.91 ) ( MIDT ) and 36.15 days ( 42.72 ) ( GNGT ) , with no difference between groups ; MID ( F ( 2.80 ) = 0.25 , p = 0.78 ) , GNG ( F ( 2,71 ) = 0.03 , p = 0.98 ) .
__label__1 Scans occurred 2 h after administration of drug or placebo and tasks were practiced before scanning .
__label__1 All participants had an alcohol breathalyzer reading of 0.0% .
__label__1 Participants were urine screened .
__label__1 A positive test for cannabis was allowed owing to its long half-life provided there was no use in the previous week .
__label__1 Participants tested negative for all other drugs , with two allowed exceptions ( see Supplementary Materials ) .
__label__1 Tasks Both the MIDT and GNGT are described in detail within Supplementary Materials .
__label__1 The MIDT was modified from and was designed to probe reward sensitivity .
__label__1 Participants could win or lose money ( or neither win nor lose ) depending upon how quickly they reacted to a target stimulus that was predicted by a win , loss , or neutral cue .
__label__1 The task was designed such that win accuracy would be 66% and £10 would be won at each session .
__label__1 The GNGT was an event-related task adapted from , consisting of a series of letter Xs and letter Ys .
__label__0 Participants were instructed to respond as fast as they could to each letter ( Go trial ) except when the letter was the same as the previous letter ( No-Go trial ) .
__label__1 Analysis of Behavioral Data For the MIDT , reward-neutral reaction time ( RT ) was analyzed .
__label__1 For the GNGT , percentage accuracy for Go trials and No-Go trials and RT for Go trials were analyzed .
__label__1 All analyses used mixed ANOVAs with drug session as the within-subject factor and group as the between-subject factor .
__label__1 Age was included as a mean-adjusted covariate in all analyses .
__label__0 Analysis of fMRI Data Details of data acquisition and preprocessing are in Supplementary Materials .
__label__1 For the MIDT , analysis focused on the ‘ cue and anticipation ’ phase and was modeled as a mini-block beginning at the cue onset and ending at the onset of the target stimulus ( see Supplementary Materials for details ) .
__label__1 The contrast of interest is the average of the ‘ reward cue anticipation ’ compared with ‘ neutral cue anticipation ’ across both runs .
__label__1 For the GNGT , successful inhibitions of No-Go trials ( ‘ stops ’ ) and unsuccessful No-Gos ( ‘ errors ’ ) were modeled against an implicit baseline of Go trials .
__label__1 Stops that were preceded by a Go trial that also did not have a response were considered ‘ fake inhibitions ’ and were modeled separately as conditions of no-interest .
__label__1 The task was powered to look at ‘ stops ’ rather than ‘ errors ’ , therefore only the ‘ stops > go ’ contrast is explored further .
__label__1 Realignment parameters and movement outliers ( scan-to-scan displacement of > 3 mm ) were added to the models as nuisance regressors .
__label__1 A region of interest ( ROI ) approach was used .
__label__1 ROIs of the VS , VP , and SN were chosen for the MIDT owing to their key roles in reward processing and evidence of abnormalities within these regions in addiction .
__label__1 Additionally , as reviewed above , these regions are particularly rich in DRD3s and therefore are potential targets for GSK598809 effects .
__label__1 For the GNGT , bilateral inferior frontal gyri ( IFG ) and anterior cingulate cortex were chosen owing to their key role in motor inhibition and abnormal recruitment in addiction .
__label__1 While not key ROIs for this task , exploratory investigations were also carried out with the DRD3 - rich regions of VS , VP , and SN .
__label__1 Mean reward-neutral ( MID ) and stop-go ( GNG ) contrast estimates were extracted from the relevant ROIs for each participant and entered into mixed ANOVAs ( see Supplementary Materials for details ) .
__label__1 A Bonferroni ’ s correction for the three regions investigated for each task was applied , with significance set at p < 0.017 .
__label__1 Additional exploratory whole-brain investigations were carried out using a voxel-wise threshold of p < 0.05 , Family-Wise Error Corrected ( see Figure 1 for ROIs and Supplementary Materials for further details ) .
__label__1 Correlational analyses were additionally carried out to investigate the relationships between ROI brain response and performance , reward and impulsivity variables , ROI brain response and duration of abstinence , and drug effects on ROI response and performance ( see Supplementary Materials for details ) .
__label__1 Twenty-nine analyses were carried out and Bonferroni-corrected significance was set at p < 0.0017 .
__label__0 Rare damaging variants in DNA repair and cell cycle pathways are associated with hippocampal and cognitive dysfunction : a combined genetic imaging study in first-episode treatment-naive patients with schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder where changes in both hippocampus and memory-related cognitive functions are central .
__label__1 However , the exact relationship between neurodevelopmental-genetic factors and hippocampal-cognitive dysfunction remains unclear .
__label__1 The general aim of our study is to link the occurrence of rare damaging mutations involved in susceptibility gene pathways to the structure and function of hippocampus in order to define genetically and phenotypically based subgroups in schizophrenia .
__label__0 In the present study , by analyzing the exome sequencing and magnetic resonance imaging data in 94 first-episode treatment-naive schizophrenia patients and 134 normal controls , we identified that a cluster of rare damaging variants ( RDVs ) enriched in DNA repair and cell cycle pathways was present only in a subgroup including 39 schizophrenic patients .
__label__0 Furthermore , we found that schizophrenic patients with this RDVs show increased resting-state functional connectivity ( rsFC ) between left hippocampus ( especially for left dentate gyrus ) and left inferior parietal cortex , as well as decreased rsFC between left hippocampus and cerebellum .
__label__1 Moreover , abnormal rsFC was related to the deficits of spatial working memory ( SWM ; that is known to recruit the hippocampus ) in patients with the RDVs .
__label__0 Taken together , our data demonstrate for the first time , to our knowledge , that damaging rare variants of genes in DNA repair and cell cycle pathways are associated with aberrant hippocampal rsFC , which was further relative to cognitive deficits in first-episode treatment-naive schizophrenia .
__label__1 Therefore , our data provide some evidence for the occurrence of phenotypic alterations in hippocampal and SWM function in a genetically defined subgroup of schizophrenia .
__label__0 Materials and methods Samples There were total 234 participants including 97 first-episode treatment-naive patients with schizophrenia and 137 healthy controls .
__label__1 Patients with schizophrenia were recruited at the Mental Health Centre of the West China Hospital , Sichuan University , China .
__label__1 Healthy volunteers were recruited from the community .
__label__1 The study was approved by the ethical committee in West China Hospital of Sichuan University .
__label__1 All participants were Han Chinese and provided written informed consent for their participation in this study .
__label__1 Clinical and memory assessments All patients were interviewed by a trained psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV ( SCID ) .
__label__1 DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were used for diagnosis .
__label__0 Those who were initially diagnosed with schizophrenia from psychosis due to the illness duration ( less than 6 months ) were followed up for at least 6 months to meet the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia .
__label__0 Psychopathology associated with schizophrenia was evaluated using the positive and negative syndrome scale .
__label__1 Healthy controls were screened with the SCID-P non-patient version for the lifetime absence of psychiatric illnesses .
__label__1 Subjects with the existence of organic brain disorders , alcohol or drug abuse , pregnancy or any severe physical illness , such as brain tumor or epilepsy , were excluded from the study .
__label__0 Schizophrenic patients and healthy controls completed SWM test in the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ; http : / / www.cantab.com ) and immediate and delayed ( 30 min ) logical memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale , respectively .
__label__0 MRI data acquisition Overall , 74 healthy controls and 74 patients with schizophrenia underwent structural MRI scans on a Signa 3.0 - T scanner ( General Electric , Medical Systems , Milwaukee , WI , USA ) , whereas 65 healthy controls and 55 patients were scanned to obtain brain resting-state functional MRI in the Department of Radiology at West China Hospital .
__label__1 Detailed procedures of scanning are presented in Supplementary Information , sections 7 and 8 .
__label__1 Sequencing and variant calling All samples were sequenced using the TruSeq Exome Enrichment Kit ( San Diego , CA , USA ) optimized for IlluminaHiSeq2000 sequencing .
__label__1 The pipeline of raw data processing and variants calling is present in Supplementary Figure 2 , which includes using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool alignment reads to the reference human genome ( hg19 ) ; Picard tools ( http : / / picard.sourceforge.net / ) to collect quality statistics and fix read group problem ; GATK for IN / DEL alignment ; Samtools ( http : / / samtools.sourceforge.net / ) to filter out low-quality reads ; and GATK to perform SNP and INDEL calling .
__label__1 Validation of selected variants was conducted by Sanger sequencing .
__label__1 Data analysis We use PLINK and KGGSeq ( http : / / statgenpro.psychiatry.hku.hk / limx / kggseq / doc / UserManual.html ) to perform individual and variants ' quality control .
__label__1 We use software KGGSeq to integrate databases to annotate the minor allele frequency of variants , including Hapmap and 1000 Genome .
__label__1 The cutoff frequency was set at 0.1% for rare variance .
__label__1 Methods implemented in PLINK / Seq ( http : / / atgu.mgh.harvard.edu / plinkseq / ) were employed for single site and gene-based association analysis .
__label__1 After filtering , we performed GO enrichment analysis in 2895 mutations within 2442 genes in cases and 4484 mutations within 3481 genes in controls using GeneMANIA ( http : / / www.genemania.org / ) . The results of enrichment indicated that two GO ( GO : 0006281 and GO : 0007049 ) only present in cases .
__label__1 We identified more mutations in controls ( that is , 2895 mutations within 2442 genes in schizophrenic patients and 4484 mutations within 3481 genes in healthy controls ) mainly because , in present study , the sample size in controls ( 134 ) is bigger than cases ( 94 ) .
__label__1 The bigger sample size in controls provides the higher chance to identify mutations .
__label__1 The weighted gene coexpression network analysis ( WGCNA ) was used for expression profile , all of which was carried out by the WGCNA R package .
__label__1 All of Brain expression data from different points in life were acquired from a published study ( The Human Brain Transcriptome ) .
__label__1 Sample size and statistical power were conducted by the statistical software , Exome Power Calculation ( http : / / darth.ssg.uab.edu : 8080 / epc / ) . rsFC of bilateral hippocampus and six hippocampal subregions was calculated by seed-to-voxel analysis using Statistical Parametric Mapping ( SPM8 , http : / / www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk / spm ) and data-processing assistant for resting-state functional MRI from resting-state functional MRI ( Supplementary material ) .
__label__1 The time courses averaged over all voxels of each hippocampus and six hippocampal subregions were extracted .
__label__1 Pearson's correlation coefficients ( r ) between time courses of left / right hippocampus and all other voxels were calculated and transformed to Fisher's z-scores to derive rsFC maps .
__label__1 Thus , 67 349 pairs of functional connectivity were calculated between right hippocampus and the other voxels of the brain , whereas 67 370 pairs of functional connectivity were computed between left hippocampus and the other voxels of the brain .
__label__1 Statistical tests on the functional connectivity maps of hippocampus between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls were performed using analysis of covariance with sex , age and education years , and volume of hippocampus as covariates in SPM8 .
__label__1 The significant threshold was set at P < 0.05 , corrected for multiple comparisons based on Monte Carlo simulations .
__label__1 Subsequently , the mean Z-value of each cluster with a significant functional connectivity ( FC ) difference was extracted and were compared by analysis of variance followed by post hoc test ( least significant difference ) in SPSS 18.0 , across patients with RDVs , patients without RDVs and healthy controls ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) , significant level of P values were set at less than 0.05 .
__label__1 Analysis of covariance followed by post hoc test were applied to test the differences of functional connectivity and memory functions among patients with RDVs , patients without RDVs and healthy controls .
__label__1 Partial correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the functional connectivities of bilateral hippocampus ( and six hippocampal subregions ) and cognitive , that is , memory functions , with age , sex and education years ( and structural hippocampal volume ) as covariance ( Supplementary material ) .
__label__1 Furthermore , Fisher's Z-transformation was used to transform the correlation coefficients ( r value ) to Z-score , and Z-test was used for testing the differences of correlations between groups .
__label__1 Corrections for multiple comparisons were applied as appropriate .
__label__1 Heritability of brain activity related to response inhibition : a longitudinal genetic study in adolescent twins The ability to inhibit prepotent but context - or goal-inappropriate responses is essential for adaptive self-regulation of behavior .
__label__0 Deficits in response inhibition , a key component of impulsivity , have been implicated as a core dysfunction in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD and addictions .
__label__1 Identification of genetically transmitted variation in the neural underpinnings of response inhibition can help to elucidate etiological pathways to these disorders and establish the links between genes , brain , and behavior .
__label__1 However , little is known about genetic influences on the neural mechanisms of response inhibition during adolescence , a developmental period characterized by weak self-regulation of behavior .
__label__0 Here we investigated heritability of ERPs elicited in a Go / No-Go task in a large sample of adolescent twins assessed longitudinally at ages 12 , 14 , and 16 .
__label__1 Genetic analyses showed significant heritability of inhibition-related frontal N2 and P3 components at all three ages , with 50 to 60% of inter-individual variability being attributable to genetic factors .
__label__1 These genetic influences included both common genetic factors active at different ages and novel genetic influences emerging during development .
__label__1 Finally , individual differences in the rate of developmental changes from age 12 to age 16 were significantly influenced by genetic factors .
__label__1 In conclusion , the present study provides the first evidence for genetic influences on neural correlates of response inhibition during adolescence and suggests that ERPs elicited in the Go / No-Go task can serve as intermediate neurophysiological phenotypes ( endophenotypes ) for the study of disinhibition and impulse control disorders . 1 .
__label__0 Method 2.1 .
__label__1 Participants Subjects were adolescent twins participating in a longitudinal study of Genetics , Neurocognition , and Adolescent Substance Abuse ( GNASA ) .
__label__1 All participants were recruited from the local population using a state birth records database , therefore , the sample is largely representative of the general population .
__label__1 Exclusion criteria were minimal and included a history of serious head trauma and health conditions precluding a laboratory visit or the ability to perform the experimental tasks ( e.g . severe visual impairment or mental retardation ) .
__label__1 The first assessment ( baseline ) was conducted at age 12 , and follow up assessments were conducted at ages 14 and 16 .
__label__1 The Continuous Performance Task ( CPT ) described below was administered to a total of 743 subjects at age 12 , 614 subjects at age 14 , and 404 subjects at age 16 ( for a more detailed description of the sample , see Table 1 ) .
__label__1 Zygosity was determined using a set of 160 DNA markers , an interview administered to the twins ’ parents , and research assistants ’ ratings of twins ’ physical similarity .
__label__1 The study was approved by Washington University Institutional Review Board , and written informed assent and consent were obtained from adolescent participants and their parents , respectively , after complete description of the study to the subjects and their parents . 2.2 .
__label__0 Materials and procedure Participants were administered a slightly modified Go / No-Go version of the Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) that has been shown to be a reliable measure of response inhibition .
__label__1 A series of letters was presented sequentially , one at a time , for 0.2 s with inter-stimulus interval of 2 s ( Fig . 1 ) .
__label__1 The subjects were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to a letter X preceded by a letter O ( O-X combination ) by pressing a button on a response pad with the right index finger , but to withhold their response when the letter O was followed by any other letter than X ( O-non-X combination ) .
__label__1 Response speed and accuracy were equally emphasized .
__label__1 A total of 400 letters were presented , of which 80 ( 20% ) were cue stimuli ( the letter “ O ” ) , 40 ( 10% ) were Go stimuli ( X following O ) , 40 ( 10% ) were No-Go stimuli ( any letter other than X following O ) , and the remaining 240 stimuli were distracters ( 12 letters not including O or X ) .
__label__1 Thus , the O-X combination represented a Go trial , whereas any O-not-X combination such as O-Z , O-K , etc . represented a No-Go trial , and there were a total of 40 O-X ( Go ) and 40 O-non-X ( No-Go ) trials in the task presented in a pseudo-random order .
__label__1 The letter O served as a warning cue informing the subject that the next stimulus is likely to be a Go signal and thus triggered a motor preparation and response prepotency .
__label__1 A No-Go stimulus ( any letter other than X ) presented after O required withholding of the pre-activated response .
__label__1 It is important to note that equal probability of Go and No-Go stimuli ensured that Go versus No-Go differences are not confounded with oddball effects that are typically observed when stimuli differ in their frequency . 2.3 .
__label__0 EEG recording and ERP analysis The EEG was recorded from 30 scalp locations according to the extended 10 – 20 system using an elastic cap with Ag / AgCl electrodes and a ground electrode on the forehead , with high - and low-pass filters set at 0.05 and 100 Hz , respectively .
__label__1 The left mastoid served as reference , and an averaged mastoid reference was digitally computed off-line using the right mastoid recording as a separate channel .
__label__1 Vertical electro-oculogram recording was used for eyeblink artifact correction using a regression-based procedure .
__label__1 After screening for artifacts , EEG signals were subjected to 30 Hz low-pass filtering , and 1000 ms epochs time-locked to the response were extracted ( from - 200 to 900 ms relative to the stimulus onset ) , baseline-corrected using a 200 ms baseline , and averaged separately for correct Go and No-Go trials , i.e . correct button presses and withholding of the response , respectively ( trials with missed responses to Go stimuli and false alarm responses to No-Go stimuli were excluded ) .
__label__1 The P3 peak was detected as the most positive voltage value within 300 – 500 ms window , and scored as absolute amplitude relative to baseline .
__label__1 The NoGo N2 peak was detected as the most negative voltage value within 190 – 360 ms window following the stimulus .
__label__1 N2 amplitude was scored as peak-to-peak difference between N2 and the amplitude of the immediately preceding positive trough as in previous studies .
__label__1 The use of different scoring methods for P3 and N2 was driven by the following considerations : P3 in the present task is a high-amplitude late component that can be reliably evaluated relative to the pre-stimulus baseline .
__label__1 In contrast , N2 is a smaller component overlapping with the ascending limb of the larger P3 component .
__label__1 Therefore , absolute N2 amplitude is strongly influenced by the rate of increase in P3 positivity , such that earlier onset and / or steeper increase in P3 lead to greater reduction of absolute N2 amplitude .
__label__1 Measuring N2 relative to the preceding positive trough mitigates this confounding as indicated by lower correlation between peak-to-peak N2 and No-Go P3 amplitudes ( r = 0.11 ) relative to the correlation between absolute N2 amplitude and No-Go P3 amplitude ( r = 0.43 ) , i.e . a reduction from 18% to 1% of shared variance . 2.4 .
__label__1 Genetic analysis and assessment of heritability Genetic analyses of twin data were conducted by fitting linear structural equation models ( SEM ) using the Mx package , which is a standard approach in twin genetic research .
__label__1 Since our data included longitudinal observations , we fit a trivariate Cholesky model ( see ) with measurements taken at ages 12 , 14 , and 16 entered as separate variables ( Fig . 5A ) .
__label__1 This multivariate approach allows one to estimate heritability of ERP phenotypes at each age , to estimate the extent of genetic overlap across ages ( i.e . to what extent the same genetic factors influence these phenotypes at different ages ) and whether there are novel genetic influences at later ages , and to test for age differences in heritability .
__label__1 Structural equation models of twin data assume that phenotypic variance arises from the following factors : additive genetic influences ( A ) , non-additive genetic influences ( D ) including within-locus allelic interaction ( dominance ) and between-locus interaction ( epistasis ) , environmental influences shared by family members ( C ) , and individually unique ( unshared ) environmental influences ( E ) .
__label__1 It is important to note that A , D , and C increase similarity within twin pairs , whereas E decreases it .
__label__1 When using only data from twin pairs reared together , it is only possible to test three of these four components simultaneously , and a decision regarding whether to test an ADE or an ACE model is made based upon the observed twin correlations ( see ) .
__label__1 Heritability , which can be estimated using these models , is the percentage of the total variance of the trait attributable to genetic factors .
__label__1 For a more detailed introduction into the genetic methods that can be applied to psychophysiological traits , we refer the reader to methodological and review papers .
__label__1 Path coefficients were estimated using the method of maximum likelihood , and the goodness of model fit was indicated by − 2 times the log likelihood ( − 2LL ) .
__label__1 As described elsewhere , the fit of nested submodels was tested by dropping individual paths from the full model ( e.g . , genetic overlap across assessments , or novel genetic influences at later ages ) , with the significance of individual paths tested by comparing the fit of the restricted submodel with the fit of the more general model using a χ2 test with degrees of freedom corresponding to the difference in the degrees of freedom between two models ( e.g . , df = 1 if only one parameter is dropped in the restricted model ) .
__label__1 If dropping a path significantly reduced the goodness of fit ( the change in χ2 was significant ) , the path was retained in the model , otherwise the more parsimonious model was chosen ( i.e . the one that accounted for the variance equally well , but with a fewer number of parameters ) .
__label__1 The fit of the nested submodels was also assessed through Akaike ’ s Information Criterion ( AIC ) , where AIC = χ2 − 2df ( see ) .
__label__1 Lower AIC values indicate better fit .
__label__1 In the case of longitudinal data , structural equation modeling permits not only the assessment of heritability at each age , but also the estimation of the extent of the overlap between genetic factors influencing the trait at different ages .
__label__1 For example , genetic factors influencing an ERP variable at age 12 may also influence it at ages 14 and 16 , which results in a significant genetic correlation across ages .
__label__1 Such genetic correlations , along with environmental correlations , give rise to cross-age phenotypic correlations , i.e . longitudinal stability .
__label__1 However , in addition to these age-invariant influences , there may be novel genetic influences emerging at later ages due to e.g . developmental changes in gene expression .
__label__1 These genetic factors contribute to the overall heritability of a trait but not to genetic correlation across ages .
__label__1 Such novel genetic ( and environmental ) influences may explain the fact that cross-age phenotypic correlation is far from perfect .
__label__1 The Cholesky models utilized in the present analyses assessed the significance of both genetic continuity and novel genetic influence across adolescence .
__label__1 To test for significant differences in heritability across age , we compared the goodness of fit of alternative Cholesky models in which heritability was constrained to be equal or allowed to vary across ages .
__label__1 To examine genetic and environmental influences on the extent of developmental changes , we computed individual age difference scores for ERP variables by subtracting values at age 12 from the corresponding values at age 16 and used them as new phenotypes in genetic analysis .
__label__1 The main advantage of this approach is that it does not make any assumptions about the shape of the developmental trajectory ( an alternative approach would be using a biometric growth modeling , however , with only three time points modeling the developmental trajectory could be inaccurate ) .
__label__1 A detailed description of genetic model fitting and comparison of alternative models is presented in the Supplementary Material . 3 .
__label__1 In Vivo Imaging of Translocator Protein , a Marker of Activated Microglia , in Alcohol Dependence Neuroinflammation may be a critical component of the neurobiology of alcohol use disorders , yet the exact nature of this relationship is not well understood .
__label__1 This work compared the brain and peripheral immune profile of alcohol dependent subjects and controls .
__label__1 Brain levels of 18 - kDa translocator protein ( TSPO ) , a marker of microglial activation and neuroinflammation , were measured with [ 11C ] PBR28 positron emission tomography imaging in 15 healthy controls and 15 alcohol dependent subjects .
__label__0 Alcohol dependent subjects were imaged 1 - 4 days ( n = 14 ) or 24 days ( n = 1 ) after their last drink .
__label__1 Linear mixed modeling of partial volume corrected [ 11C ] PBR28 data revealed a main effect of alcohol dependence ( p = 0.034 ) , corresponding to 10% lower TSPO levels in alcohol dependent subjects .
__label__1 Within this group , exploratory analyses found a negative association of TSPO levels in hippocampus and striatum with alcohol dependence severity ( p < 0.035 ) .
__label__1 Peripheral immune response was assessed in a subset of subjects by measuring cytokine expression from monocytes cultured both in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide .
__label__1 Peripheral monocyte response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation was lower in alcohol dependent subjects compared to controls for the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL - 6 and IL - 8 .
__label__1 Thus , alcohol dependent individuals exhibited less activated microglia in brain and a blunted peripheral pro-inflammatory response compared to controls .
__label__1 These findings suggest a role for pharmaceuticals tuning the neuroimmune system as therapeutics for alcohol dependence .
__label__0 Methods Subjects Fifteen alcohol dependent subjects ( 11 men , 4 women ) and fifteen healthy control subjects ( 11 men , 4 women ) matched for age , sex , and single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs6971 genotype were recruited from the local population to participate in one [ 11C ] PBR28 PET scan including arterial blood sampling and one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan .
__label__1 Prior to scanning , all subjects were genotyped for the rs6971 SNP as previously described .
__label__1 This polymorphism affects the affinity of [ 11C ] PBR28 for the TSPO site .
__label__1 T / T homozygotes ( Low Affinity Binders ) were excluded from the study .
__label__1 Alcohol dependent subjects met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence with no axis I disorder other than nicotine dependence , with no current or past significant medical or neurological disorders and no psychotropic medication use over the previous month .
__label__1 Cigarette use was evaluated by self report .
__label__1 Subjects with prior alcohol detoxifications using benzodiazepines were not eligible , since they would be more likely to require benzodiazepines during detoxification and these drugs are active at the TSPO site .
__label__0 During screening , alcohol dependence severity was evaluated with the Alcohol Dependence Scale , alcohol craving was surveyed with the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire , and alcohol use over the previous month was collected with the Timeline Follow-Back ( TLFB ) .
__label__1 Alcohol dependent subjects were admitted to the Connecticut Mental Health Center Clinical Neuroscience Unit and imaged at 1 - 4 days ( n = 14 ) or 24 days ( n = 1 ) after their last drink .
__label__1 This time frame was selected to most closely examine microglia in alcohol dependence in the absence of alcohol but before major brain changes occur following alcohol abstinence .
__label__1 While on the unit , the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment was administered every 6 hours until scores were stably 0 .
__label__1 None of the subjects in this study required benzodiazepine treatment .
__label__1 Healthy controls had no history of significant major medical disorders or head trauma and did not meet DSM-IV criteria for current or past psychiatric or substance abuse diagnosis other than nicotine use .
__label__1 In addition , control subjects reported drinking fewer than eight alcoholic drinks per week .
__label__1 For all female subjects , negative pregnancy tests were established during screening and prior to radiotracer administration on the day of the scans .
__label__1 All procedures were approved by the Yale University School of Medicine Human Investigation Committee and the Radiation Safety Committee .
__label__1 Written informed consent , approved by the Yale University School of Medicine Human Investigation Committee , was obtained from all subjects prior to participation in this study .
__label__1 Imaging Data Acquisition [ 11C ] PBR28 was produced as previously described , resulting in high specific activities of 294 ± 188 MBq / nmol .
__label__1 PET data were acquired with a High Resolution Research Tomograph ( HRRT ; Siemens ) , and head motion data were acquired with an optical motion-tracking tool ( Vicra , NDI Systems ) .
__label__0 PET imaging sessions began with acquisition of a 6 min 137Cs transmission scan for attenuation correction of the emission data .
__label__1 PET data acquisition began simultaneously with administration of 551 ± 174 MBq [ 11C ] PBR28 as a slow bolus over 1 min , with data acquisition lasting 120 min .
__label__1 The metabolite-corrected arterial input function was measured as previously described .
__label__0 Magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) data were acquired for anatomical localization of [ 11C ] PBR28 uptake .
__label__1 MR data were acquired with a 3T Trio Scanner ( Siemens Medical Systems , Erlangen , Germany ) with a weighted gradient-echo ( MPRAGE ) sequence featuring the following parameters : ( TE = 3.3 ms ; TI = 1,100 ms , TF = 2,500 ms , FA = 7 ° ) giving 1 mm3 isotropic resolution .
__label__1 Imaging Data Processing and Analysis Dynamic list-mode PET data were histogrammed into discrete time frames up to 5 min and reconstructed with the MOLAR algorithm .
__label__0 To transform PET data into MR space , a summed image of the first 10 min of PET data was registered to the subject-specific T1 - weighted MRI using a mutual information algorithm with six degrees of freedom ( FLIRT , FSL 3.2 ; Analysis Group ; FMRIB , Oxford , UK ) .
__label__1 The native MRI was then co-registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) template space with a nonlinear transformation algorithm ( BioImage Suite ; http : / / www.bioimagesuite.com ) for Region of Interest ( ROI ) definition .
__label__1 The dynamic PET data were corrected for partial volume effects with previously published methods using SPM12 - segmented tissue masks .
__label__1 The time-activity curves of radioactivity concentration in tissue were extracted from the regions of cerebellum , frontal cortex , hippocampus , and striatum , since these are important regions affected by alcohol-induced neurodegeneration and dysregulated neuroimmune function .
__label__1 For PET data , the primary outcome measure of this study was the total distribution volume ( VT ) , which is the ratio at equilibrium of [ 11C ] PBR28 concentration in tissue to [ 11C ] PBR28 concentration in arterial plasma .
__label__1 The VT is indirectly proportional to the number of TSPO sites available for [ 11C ] PBR28 binding .
__label__1 Multilinear analysis ( MA1 ; ) with t * = 30 min was used to estimate VT as previously validated .
__label__1 For visualization purposes , voxel-wise parametric images were also calculated with an algorithm constraining the MA1 parameters to reduce noise following spatial smoothing with an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel .
__label__1 Endotoxin Stimulation of Peripheral Monocytes Briefly , venous blood samples were acquired on the day of the PET scan for 11 alcohol dependent subjects and 9 healthy controls .
__label__1 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated and placed in culture medium RPMI - 1640 .
__label__1 After initial incubation over 1 h , cells were stimulated with either 10 ng / mL lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or 50 μL phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , and further incubated for an additional 24 h .
__label__1 Cytokine concentrations were assayed with MILLIPLEX panel assay , and fold-change in cytokine expression for each cytokine within each subject was reported as the ratio of average cytokine concentration in LPS-stimulated samples to average cytokine concentration in PBS-added ( non-stimulated ) samples .
__label__1 A detailed description of these methods is available in Supplementary Methods .
__label__1 Statistics [ 11C ] PBR28 VT values were statistically analyzed with a linear mixed modeling approach .
__label__1 To test the null hypothesis of no difference in [ 11C ] PBR28 VT between the alcohol dependent and healthy control groups , a model was constructed with rs6971 genotype as a fixed factor , group as a between-subjects factor and region as a within-subjects factor .
__label__1 Post-hoc linear contrasts were generated to examine regional differences in [ 11C ] PBR28 VT between alcohol dependent subjects and healthy controls .
__label__1 A power analysis using preliminary data before the study began determined a sample size of 30 subjects ( 15 in each group ) to provide 80% probability of detecting significant differences in [ 11C ] PBR28 VT between the two groups .
__label__1 As an exploratory analysis , possible associations between [ 11C ] PBR28 VT were examined for all regions with reported drinks per day over the previous month , Alcohol Dependence Scale score , and Alcohol Craving Questionnaire Score in each brain region .
__label__1 For this analysis , correction for rs6971 genotype was implemented by separating the subjects by genotype , and then creating a z-score for each variable ( regional [ 11C ] PBR28 VT , drinks per day over the previous month , Alcohol Dependence Scale score , and craving score ) within each genotype group .
__label__1 Standard linear regression analysis techniques were then performed on these ‘ standardized ’ variables .
__label__1 This procedure is analogous to previous reports that ‘ correlated ’ each variable with genotype and ran regression analysis on standardized residuals of this correlation , which effectively created a z-score by genotype .
__label__1 The results of this analysis were not corrected for multiple comparisons due to the exploratory nature of these analyses .
__label__1 A linear mixed model approach was used to test the null hypothesis of no differences in fold-change of cytokine expression between alcohol dependent subjects and healthy controls .
__label__1 Since different effects were expected for pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines , a separate model was constructed for each class of cytokines using group as a between-subjects factor and cytokine as a within-subjects factor .
__label__1 Post-hoc linear contrasts were generated to examine individual cytokines for differences between alcohol dependent subjects and healthy controls .
__label__1 Statistical analyses were all performed with R 3.1.1 .
__label__0 Increased habenular connectivity in opioid users is associated with an α5 subunit nicotinic receptor genetic variant Background and Objectives Opioid use disorder ( OUD ) is a chronic disorder with relapse based on both desire for reinforcement ( craving ) and avoidance of withdrawal .
__label__1 The aversive aspect of dependence and relapse has been associated with a small brain structure called the habenula , which expresses large numbers of both opioid and nicotinic receptors .
__label__1 Additionally , opioid withdrawal symptoms can be induced in opioid-treated rodents by blocking not only opioid , but also nicotinic receptors .
__label__1 This receptor co-localization and cross-induction of withdrawal therefore might lead to genetic variation in the nicotinic receptor influencing development of human opioid dependence through its impact on the aversive components of opioid dependence .
__label__0 Methods We studied habenular resting state functional connectivity with related brain structures , specifically the striatum .
__label__0 We compared abstinent psychiatric patients who use opioids ( N = 51 ) to psychiatric patients who don ’ t ( N = 254 ) to identify an endophenotype of opioid use that focused on withdrawal avoidance and aversion rather than the more commonly examined craving aspects of relapse .
__label__1 Results We found that habenula – striatal connectivity was stronger in opioid-using patients .
__label__1 Increased habenula-striatum connectivity was observed in opioid-using patients with the low risk rs16969968 GG genotype , but not in patients carrying the high risk AG or AA genotypes .
__label__1 Conclusions We propose that increased habenula – striatum functional connectivity may be modulated by the nicotinic receptor variant rs16969968 and may lead to increased opioid use .
__label__1 Scientific Significance Our data uncovered a promising brain target for development of novel anti-addiction therapies and may help the development of personalized therapies against opioid abuse .
__label__0 To determine the role of the habenula in opioid use and whether the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor SNP rs16969968 is associated with the possible habenular mechanisms of opioid use , we studied the resting state functional connectivity ( RSFC ) between the habenula and the striatum using functional MRI ( fMRI ) in psychiatric inpatients with and without opioid use at The Menninger Clinic , a psychiatric clinic in Houston , TX .
__label__0 Methods Participants Participants were psychiatric inpatients from a larger study at the Menninger Clinic in Houston , TX , USA ( McNair Initiative for Neuroscience Discovery – Menninger / Baylor , or MIND-MB project .
__label__1 All participation was voluntary with approximately 72% of eligible patients consenting to participate .
__label__1 Psychiatric disorder diagnoses were assessed using the research versions of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders ( SCID-I / II ) .
__label__0 The SCID-I and SCID II were administered by master ’ s level researchers after reviewing pertinent psychiatric and psychosocial evaluations as well as consulting with the attending psychiatrist .
__label__0 Most inpatients showed co-occurring psychiatric illnesses , with the most common diagnoses being major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , anxiety disorders ( ANX ) , personality disorders ( PD ) , and substance use disorders ( SUD ) .
__label__0 We used the World Health Organization ASSIST scale , which contains 10 subscales for specific drugs to study opioid use .
__label__0 We used the ASSIST scale to divide patients into two groups : low versus moderate / high opioid use ( called non-users versus users from now on ) .
__label__1 From an original group of 316 patients , two were removed for missing ASSIST scale data .
__label__1 Of the remaining 314 patients , nine patients were removed for missing or low quality MRI data , leaving a final sample of 305 patients ( Table 1 ) .
__label__0 Procedures were approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board and the Research and Development Committee of the MEDVAMC .
__label__1 All patients had been drug-free at least since time of admission and were imaged an average of 4.3 days following clinic admission .
__label__1 Imaging Informed consent was obtained prior to scanning in a 3T Siemens Trio MR scanner in the Core for Advanced MR Imaging at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , TX , USA .
__label__0 A 4.5 min structural MPRAGE sequence ( TE = 2.66 ms , TR = 1200 ms , flip angle = 12 ° , 256 × 256 matrix , 160 one mm axial slices at 1 × 1 × 1 mm voxels ) was collected , followed by a 5 min resting state scan ( RSFC : TE = 40 ms , TR = 2 s , flip angle = 90 , 3.4 × 3.4 × 4 mm voxels ) .
__label__0 During the resting state scan , subjects were instructed to relax .
__label__1 A large “ X ” was displayed on the screen during the resting state scan .
__label__1 RSFC data were pre-processed using the CONN Functional Connectivity Toolbox .
__label__1 The preprocessing pipeline consisted of realignment to the first time series image , slice-timing correction , structural segmentation and normalization to the MNI EPI template , functional normalization , ART-based outlier detection using default settings , and smoothing with an 8 mm full width at high maximum ( FWHM ) Gaussian smoothing kernel ( although importantly , the habenula ROI was not smoothed ) .
__label__1 The main region of interest ( ROI ) was the striatum , defined as the sum of caudate , putamen , and globus pallidus .
__label__1 Additional ROIs for exploratory analyses included the inferior , medial , and superior frontal gyri ( iFG , mFG , sFG ) , insula , nucleus accumbens , septum verum , locus coeruleus , amygdala , and anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) and were created in AFNI using the MNI atlas Figure 1A and C–E ) .
__label__1 Those regions were chosen because they are known to be important for habenular circuits .
__label__1 Left and right habenula ROIs were generated for each subject using SPM 8 ( http : / / imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk / imaging ) .
__label__1 Functional images were downsampled to 3 × 3 × 3 to try to mitigate partial volume issues derived from the habenula size being comparable to voxel size .
__label__1 Each habenula was identified using brain landmarks and a 3 × 3 × 3 mm cube was manually placed for each individual subject ( Figure 1B ) .
__label__1 RSFC data were then analyzed using the CONN functional connectivity toolbox .
__label__1 White matter , cerebrospinal fluid , realignment , and scrubbing were considered variables of no interest confounders .
__label__1 Statistics Fisher ’ s z-transformed correlation coefficients between the different seeds for each subject were used in statistical analyses .
__label__1 ANOVA was used to test the primary outcome : RSFC between the habenula ( separated in right and left ) and the striatum .
__label__1 Next we subdivided the striatum into its constituent parts : right and left caudate , globus pallidus , and putamen .
__label__1 Because gender was found to be different between groups , we then used ANCOVA to control for the effect of gender after finding initial differences in habenula-whole striatum .
__label__1 ANCOVA was also used to further explore differences in RSFC activation in striatal sub-regions .
__label__1 Since we were interested in the possible relationship between opioid use and habenular connectivity , the high co-use of different drugs of abuse was dealt with by stepwise regression .
__label__1 First , we separated patients into users and non-users of each drug .
__label__1 The WHO-ASSIST questionnaire was used to assess drug use .
__label__1 The ASSIST is divided into ten subcategories ( tobacco , alcohol , cannabis , cocaine , amphetamine , inhalants , sedatives , hallucinogens , opioids , and other ) .
__label__1 With the exception of alcohol , each sub-category of drug was divided into groups of low ( scores of 0 – 3 ) and pooled moderate to high ( 4 + ) use .
__label__1 Alcohol use was scored as low ( 0 – 10 ) and moderate to high ( 11 + ) , as defined in the ASSIST questionnaire .
__label__1 Individual patients could be a “ user ” of more than one drug .
__label__1 We tested whether opioid use would predict the habenula-striatum RSFC when the effect of additional drugs was considered by entering each drug in a stepwise multiple regression analysis .
__label__1 We then investigated possible genotype differences within the opioid users and non-users on the Right habenula / Left caudate RSFC .
__label__1 We used ANCOVA to test Right habenula / Left caudate RSFC after separating participants according to their rs16969968 genotype .
__label__1 We pooled those with an AG or AA genotype , since the phenotype seems to be dominant for the A allele .
__label__1 In this case , we used population structure , despite the patients being ethnically homogenous ( 97% Caucasian ) , and sex as covariates .
__label__1 Ten ancestry informative markers ( AIMs ) were genotyped and used to calculate population structure .
__label__1 Data from the current participant sample were compared to the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain–Human Genome Diversity Panel ( CEPH-HGDP ) samples ( 1,035 subjects of 51 populations ) as previously described .
__label__1 It has been shown before that 94.6% of the maximum informativity value is obtained using these ten AIMs .
__label__1 Finally , in a series of exploratory experiments we studied the connectivity between the habenula and several brain regions known or hypothesized to be related to habenular activity ( iFG , mFG , sFG , insula , striatum , nucleus accumbens , septum verum , locus coeruleus , amygdala , and ACC ) .
__label__1 These data are presented as exploratory since we did not perform any corrections for multiple comparisons .
__label__1 Automatic schizophrenic discrimination on fNIRS by using complex brain network analysis and SVM Background Schizophrenia is a kind of serious mental illness .
__label__1 Due to the lack of an objective physiological data supporting and a unified data analysis method , doctors can only rely on the subjective experience of the data to distinguish normal people and patients , which easily lead to misdiagnosis .
__label__0 In recent years , functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) has been widely used in clinical diagnosis , it can get the hemoglobin concentration through the variation of optical intensity .
__label__0 Methods Firstly , the prefrontal brain networks were constructed based on oxy-Hb signals from 52 - channel fNIRS data of schizophrenia and healthy controls .
__label__1 Then , Complex Brain Network Analysis ( CBNA ) was used to extract features from the prefrontal brain networks .
__label__1 Finally , a classier based on Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) is designed and trained to discriminate schizophrenia from healthy controls .
__label__0 We recruited a sample which contains 34 healthy controls and 42 schizophrenia patients to do the one-back memory task .
__label__1 The hemoglobin response was measured in the prefrontal cortex during the task using a 52 - channel fNIRS system .
__label__1 Results The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory classification with the accuracy of 85.5% , 92.8% for schizophrenia samples and 76.5% for healthy controls .
__label__1 Also , our results suggested that fNIRS has the potential capacity to be an effective objective biomarker for the diagnosis of schizophrenia .
__label__1 Conclusions Our results suggested that , using the appropriate classification method , fNIRS has the potential capacity to be an effective objective biomarker for the diagnosis of schizophrenia .
__label__0 Methods DataSet description Ten to twenty system channel map for the 52 channels The dataset was provided by Peking University Sixth Hospital .
__label__1 The fNIRS measurements were conducted with a 52 multichannel fNIRS System ( ETG - 4000 , Hitachi Medical Co . , Japan ) .
__label__1 In the system , 33 probes ( 17 emitters and 16 detectors ) were stabilized on the scalp and arranged as a 3 × 11 array , which was positioned according to the international 10 – 20 system .
__label__1 The recording channels were established between each pair of emitters and detectors , which resulted in 52 channels total .
__label__1 Specifically , the detector between Channel 5 and 6 was located at Fz , Channel 46 and 49 were placed in Fp2 and Fp1 , and the emitters which were close to Channel 43 and 52 were fitted around T4 and T3 , respectively .
__label__1 Fz , Fp2 , Fp1 , T4 and T3 are the reference electrode positions in the international 10 - 20 system , shown in Fig .   1 .
__label__1 Thus , the fNIRS probe set covered the entire prefrontal cortex and some regions of the superior temporal cortex .
__label__1 The relative changes in oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb were measured using a reflectance mode with two different wavelengths ( 695 and 830 nm ) of near-infrared light .
__label__1 The relative changes in total-Hb were equal to the sum of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb .
__label__1 The temporal resolution of fNIRS was set to 0.1 s .
__label__0 The dataset included 42 patients with schizophrenia ( mean age : 31 ± 12 years , female / male : 26 / 16 ) and 34 ageand sex-matched healthy controls ( mean age : 33 ± 10 years , female / male : 20 / 14 ) .
__label__1 All subjects were right-handed and native Chinese speakers .
__label__0 The diagnosis for schizophrenia was based on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ) .
__label__1 The healthy controls were enrolled through the local community and then assessed to confirm no history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders .
__label__1 This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of Peking University Sixth Hospital .
__label__1 All subjects provided written informed consent after the experimental procedure had been fully explained .
__label__1 The time variance in the data retrieval The experiment was performed in a quiet environment .
__label__1 All subjects were required to maintain emotionally stability prior to the experiment and to avoid moving the head as much as possible during the measurement .
__label__0 We designed a one-back memory task .
__label__1 The task comprised a 5s pre-scan and a 25s waiting period , a 70s task period , and a 50s post-task baseline period .
__label__1 We can see it in Fig .   2 .
__label__1 During the pre - and post-task baseline periods , the subjects were required to stare the screen .
__label__1 During the task period , they were instructed to press a button with their right index finger whether or not the current image presented on the screen was the same as the previously shown one .
__label__1 The images were changed every 2s and the rendering time was 0.5s , there were a total of 29 figures shown .
__label__1 A detailed description of this experimental procedure could be found in elsewhere .
__label__1 Schizophrenic discrimination method The framework of schizophrenia discrimination The process of schizophrenia discrimination includes preprocessing the fNIRS data , constructing brain network , feature extraction , training the classifier , cross validation and testing .
__label__1 The flowchart of schizophrenia discrimination process is shown in Fig .   3 .
__label__1 In this paper , CBNA is used to extract the feature eigenvalues and SVM is used as the classifier .
__label__1 Preprocessing data Original oxy hemoglobin concentration The fourier transform of original oxy hemoglobin concentration of normal and schizophrenia people Oxy hemoglobin concentration before and after low-pass filtering The original fNIRS data of a schizophrenia patient is shown in Fig .   4 , the blue line plots the oxy hemoglobin concentration variation of healthy person .
__label__1 In order to reduce the effects of the high frequency noise , low-pass filtering is used to do data preprocessing .
__label__1 Before low-pass filtering , We first use Fast Fourier transform to do spectrum analysis to find which frequency the fNIRS exists in .
__label__1 Figure   5 shows the Fast Fourier transform result of original oxy hemoglobin concentration variation of healthy person and schizophrenia patient , blue line represents the healthy person and red line represents the schizophrenia patient .
__label__1 It is obviously that the frequency of fNIRS signal mainly exists in 0.0 – 0.5 HZ , so a low-pass filter with the cut-off frequency 0.5 Hz is designed to do the filtering .
__label__1 The result of the low-pass filtering is shown in Fig .   6 .
__label__1 The blue line represents original data and red line represents processed data .
__label__1 It can be seen that the curve after low-pass filter is smoother than before , some high frequency noise is reduced .
__label__1 This reduced the effects of high frequency noise and improved the classification accuracy .
__label__1 Construct the brain network The flow chart of functional brain network construction The process of a functional brain network construction is shown in Fig .   7 .
__label__1 During the construction process , defining the edge and node of the brain network are two important steps .
__label__1 Nodes in the brain network correspond to the measured 52 channels of fNIRS .
__label__1 The Pearson correlation coefficient of fNIRS time series between different nodes is usually calculated to quantify the relationship between them .
__label__1 The edge is defined by setting an appropriate threshold to binarize the connection relationship of the nodes .
__label__1 The Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated as follows , take the i th and j th channel ’ s fNRIS data as variable X , Y ( i , j = 1,2 … 52 , i ≠ j ) , the Pearson correlation coefficient is r i , j , then Where c o v ( X , Y ) is the covariance , σ X , σ Y are the standard deviation , μ X , μ Y are the mean of variable X and Y respectively .
__label__1 The Pearson correlation coefficient of two variables X and Y is equal to the covariance divided by the product of the standard deviation of the two variables .
__label__1 Pearson correlation coefficient matrix of a schizophrenic patient after color rendering From the calculation process of Pearson correlation coefficient , we can get a Pearson correlation coefficient matrix with a row and column which have 52 dimensions for a subject .
__label__1 Each element in the matrix is a Pearson correlation coefficient value .
__label__1 When i = j , the Pearson correlation coefficient is 1 .
__label__1 Here we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of 76 subjects and constructed 76 correlation coefficient matrices .
__label__1 Fig .   8 shows the result of Pearson correlation coefficient matrix of a schizophrenic patient after color rendering .
__label__1 After quantizing the relationship between 52 channels , we got the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix , it is necessary to choose an appropriate threshold T in order to construct the edge of the nodes .
__label__1 Whether there is an edge connection between two nodes is depend on the Pearson correlation between two channels.If the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient is greater than the threshold , there is an edge between the corresponding nodes , and vice versa .
__label__1 We use sparsity as a measurement of the threshold T .
__label__1 Sparsity is the ratio of the actual number of edge to the possible maximum number of edge in matrix .
__label__1 There is no quantitative relationship between sparsity S and threshold T .
__label__1 If the sparsity of the binarized matrix is set to 50% , when binarizing the Pearson correlation matrix , T is the median of the ascending correlation coefficient .
__label__1 When the correlation coefficient is greater than the median , it has edge and vice verse .
__label__1 The actual number of edge is just half of the maximum possible one .
__label__1 In the study of the brain network , most researchers use sparsity with fixed interval to study the topological properties of the brain network with multiple thresholds .
__label__1 Here we set the sparsity range from 1 to 50% to ensure the sparseness of the network .
__label__1 After binarization , we get the binary matrix which is corresponding to the brain network matrix .
__label__1 Thus we get the brain network of 76 subjects .
__label__1 Feature extraction based on CBNA Result of eigenvectors constructed with the attribute of node degree when the threshold is set to 0.21 After get the brain network of 76 subjects , the basic attribute index of the network is calculated by using the formula of basic attribute value in complex network theory .
__label__1 The basic attributes we used here are the degree of node , clustering coefficient , local efficiency and global efficiency .
__label__1 In this way we get a 52 - dimensional eigenvector of the above four attributes .
__label__1 Since the threshold is changed from 0.01 to 0.5 with an interval of 0.01 , it is necessary to select eigenvector with significant differences in each attribute from the 50 thresholds to make subsequent classification decisions .
__label__1 After reduce the dimension of eigenvector of each attribute , we find there is a significant difference of the node degree when the threshold is set to 0.21 .
__label__1 Thus , we choose the attribute of the node degree at threshold 0.21 to construct the final eigenvector .
__label__1 Fig .   9 shows the result of eigenvectors constructed with the attribute of node degree when the threshold is 0.21 .
__label__1 It can be seen that the eigenvector between the healthy control and schizophrenic has significance difference .
__label__1 SVM-based classifier The SVM is a learning machine for a two-class classification problem .
__label__1 It is proposed by Vapnik as an extension of statistical learning theory .
__label__1 Due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and could acquire high accuracy in the classification , SVM has been widely used in many areas .
__label__1 SVM conceptually implements the idea that vectors are non-linearly mapped to a high dimension feature space .
__label__1 In the feature space , a linear separation surface is created to separate the training data by minimizing the margin between the vectors of the two classes .
__label__1 The training ends with the definition of a decision surface that divides the space into two sub-spaces .
__label__1 Each sub-space corresponds to one class of the training data .
__label__1 Once the training is completed , the test data are mapped to the feature space .
__label__1 A class is then assigned to the test data depending on which sub-space they are mapped to .
__label__1 In this paper , a SVM toolkit named libsvm written by Lin Chih-Jen from Taiwan University is used .
__label__1 A radial basis function is selected as a kernel function and parameters are kept as default values .
__label__1 Cross validation is frequently used in classification problems , which mainly divided into K fold cross validation and the leave-one-out cross validation .
__label__1 Here we use the leave-one-out cross validation to evaluate the classification result .
__label__1 Suppose there are N samples , leave-one-out cross validation continues N rounds , each round one sample will be as a test sample , the rest N − 1 samples are as the training sample .
__label__1 After N rounds of cross validation , each round will get a classification accuracy .
__label__1 Finally , the average classification accuracy will be acquired for N rounds . leave-one-out cross validation can effectively reduce the classification accuracy error caused by the inefficient sample .
__label__1 Here the dataset we used include 34 healthy persons and 42 schizophrenic patients .
__label__1 In the leave-one-out cross validation , the dataset is separated into 76 samples , every sample will be as a test sample and the rest 75 samples will be a training set , continues 76 rounds .
__label__1 Aberrant salience network functional connectivity in auditory verbal hallucinations : a first episode psychosis sample Auditory verbal hallucinations ( AVH ) often lead to distress and functional disability , and are frequently associated with psychotic illness .
__label__0 Previously both state and trait magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies of AVH have identified activity in brain regions involving auditory processing , language , memory and areas of default mode network ( DMN ) and salience network ( SN ) .
__label__1 Current evidence is clouded by research mainly in participants on long-term medication , with chronic illness and by choice of seed regions made ‘ a priori ’ .
__label__0 Thus , the aim of this study was to elucidate the intrinsic functional connectivity in patients presenting with first episode psychosis ( FEP ) .
__label__0 Resting state functional MRI data were available from 18 FEP patients , 9 of whom also experienced AVH of sufficient duration in the scanner and had symptom capture functional MRI ( sc fMRI ) , together with 18 healthy controls .
__label__1 Symptom capture results were used to accurately identify specific brain regions active during AVH ; including the superior temporal cortex , insula , precuneus , posterior cingulate and parahippocampal complex .
__label__1 Using these as seed regions , patients with FEP and AVH showed increased resting sb-FC between parts of the SN and the DMN and between the SN and the cerebellum , but reduced sb-FC between the claustrum and the insula , compared to healthy controls.It is possible that aberrant activity within the DMN and SN complex may be directly linked to impaired salience appraisal of internal activity and AVH generation .
__label__1 Furthermore , decreased intrinsic functional connectivity between the claustrum and the insula may lead to compensatory over activity in parts of the auditory network including areas involved in DMN , auditory processing , language and memory , potentially related to the complex and individual content of AVH when they occur .
__label__0 Materials and methods Participants Eighteen individuals diagnosed with FEP were recruited from the Early Intervention Service and Youth Service , Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust within 12 months of initial diagnosis and treatment onset .
__label__1 FEP was defined as the first presentation of DSM-IV schizophrenia , schizophreniform disorder , schizoaffective disorder or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified , confirmed using M.I.N.I .
__label__1 International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I . 6.0 ) .
__label__1 All had at least one episode of AVH every other day .
__label__0 Age , gender and handedness matched healthy controls ( HC ) ( n = 18 ) were recruited from the local community via advertisements .
__label__1 HC had no personal history of mental illness or current mental health problems , and no first-degree relative with a history of psychotic disorder as defined by self-report .
__label__1 Exclusion criteria for both groups included a history of any neurological disorder , seizures , or significant head injury , any contraindications for MRI and any significant risk history including suicide risk and violence ( as assessed by the clinical team ) .
__label__1 Ethical approval was obtained from the NHS HRA ( reference 13 / WM / 0277 ) Ethics Committee .
__label__1 All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study .
__label__1 Procedure , MRI acquisition and preprocessing Information on demographic and clinical variables including age , gender , marital status , duration of treated and untreated psychosis , and current medication was recorded for patients .
__label__0 AVH were comprehensively assessed for both frequency and quality using the Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire—Revised ( BAVQ-R ) , Topography of Voices Rating Scale ( TVRS ) , Voice Power Differential Scale ( VPD ) , and Auditory Hallucinations Subscale of Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale ( PSYRATS ) .
__label__0 MRI acquisition Patients underwent neuroimaging including fMRI-symptom capture , resting state and structural MRI at the Birmingham University Imaging Centre using a 3 T Philips Achieva MRI scanner , whilst the HC completed the resting state and structural scan .
__label__0 Patients completed a 10 - min fMRI symptom capture run wherein 200 volumes of BOLD-fMRI were acquired ( TE = 30 ms , whole-brain coverage , TR = 3 s , voxel size 3 mm × 3 mm × 2 mm , field of view 192 × 192 × 100 , flip angle 90 ° , matrix 64 × 64 ) .
__label__1 Throughout this scan , participants had their right thumb resting on a button ; and they were instructed to press and hold this for the duration of any AVHs experienced .
__label__0 Participants completed a 10 - min resting state scan when they were in the scanner in a state of wakeful rest with their eyes closed .
__label__0 Two hundred volumes of BOLD-fMRI were acquired ( TE = 30 ms , whole-brain coverage , TR = 3 s , voxel size 3 mm × 3 mm × 2 mm , field of view 192 × 192 × 100 , flip angle 90 ° , matrix 64 × 64 ) .
__label__0 T1 - weighted images ( TR = 8.4 ms , TE = 3.8 ms , flip angle = 8 ° , FOV = 288 × 232 × 175 mm , voxel size 1mm3 ) were acquired for each participant for image registration .
__label__1 Participants wore headphones and earplugs throughout both scan runs to attenuate the noise of the scanner .
__label__1 Preprocessing Anatomical and functional MRI scans were preprocessed with statistical parametric mapping software ( SPM 8 , Friston , The Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology , London , UK ; http : / / www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk / spm ) and the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI Advanced Edition ( DPARSFA ) V3.1 ( http : / / rfmri.org / DPARSF ) .
__label__1 Preprocessing of symptom capture data : Preprocessing of the acquired images included slice time correction , realignment , co-registration with the anatomical image , spatial normalisation using a Montreal Neurological Institute template scan , and smoothing using 8 - mm full-width-at-half-maximum 3D Gaussian kernel .
__label__1 If excessive movement was noted of realignment , defined as a translation of > 1 voxel ( 3 mm × 3 mm × 2 mm ) or rotation of > 2 degrees , artefact repair was performed to correct for it using the ArtRepair toolbox .
__label__1 Preprocessing of resting state scans : The first ten volumes from each scan were excluded as dummy scans to allow stability of longitudinal magnetisation .
__label__1 The images were then reoriented and corrected for slice timing differences , with the middle slice being used as a reference slice .
__label__1 Both the T1 and the functional images were reoriented in order to improve co-registration accuracy .
__label__1 Brain extraction was then performed on the T1 images in order to remove the skull before co-registration to the functional images and to improve the co-registration algorithm .
__label__1 The T1 images were then coregistered to the functional images and segmented into grey matter , white matter ( WM ) , and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) partitions .
__label__1 The Friston 24 - parameter model was then used to obtain six head motion parameters , six head motion parameters one time-point before , and the 12 corresponding squared items and input them into our model as nuisance regressors .
__label__1 Any time-points that had a framewise displacement of more than 0.5 as well as one time-point before them and two time-points after them were regressed out .
__label__1 The WM and the CSF masks that were created during segmentation were then combined and their time series was calculated .
__label__1 Then , their first five principal components were calculated and entered as nuisance regressors in the model ( CompCor ) .
__label__1 Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Algebra ( DARTEL ) was used to create a group specific template to which all of the images were normalised to .
__label__1 An affine transformation of the images to the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) stereotactic space using the parameters estimated in DARTEL was performed .
__label__1 Finally , the images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width at half maximum .
__label__1 Data analysis Statistical analyses of demographic and clinical data were performed using SPSS ( SPSS version 24 , Chicago , IL , USA ) .
__label__1 After testing for the normality of the distributions , continuous variables were compared using t-tests and categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests .
__label__1 Significance was set at p < 0.05 .
__label__1 Symptom capture analysis General linear model analysis was used on the pre-processed images .
__label__1 For each subject , one contrast vector ( AVH minus rest ) was specified to evaluate the effect of AVH ( button pressed ) relative to the baseline ( button not pressed ) with the six movement parameters ( three translation and three rotation ) from pre-processing entered as nuisance regressors .
__label__1 This produced a contrast image for each subject that was then entered into a second level , random-effects analysis , using a one-sample t-test .
__label__1 A group comparison of activation during AVH and at rest was then conducted .
__label__1 A cluster was considered as significant at p < 0.01 ( uncorrected ) and an extent criterion of k = 60 to reduce the likelihood of identifying false positive clusters .
__label__1 The uncorrected threshold was chosen to reduce the likelihood of type 2 error .
__label__1 Seed-based FC analysis The brain regions that were identified in the symptom capture study were included as regions of interest ( ROI ) for the FC analyses .
__label__1 ROI were created using spherical peak coordinates with a radius of 4 mm .
__label__1 Four millimetre radius was chosen over 6 mm , more frequently used , in the aim of adding specificity to regions chosen .
__label__1 Pearson ’ s correlations coefficients between the time series of each seed region with voxels of the rest of the brain were then calculated for each ROI .
__label__1 A Fisher transformation was then used to convert these voxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficients into whole-brain z-values for each participant to conduct second-level analyses in SPM8 .
__label__1 The FC maps from individual participants were separately analysed using one-sample t-test for the entire sample with cluster level significance level set at p < 0.05 ( family-wise error ( FWE ) corrected ) .
__label__1 The results from the one sample t-test were used to derive search volume masks for the FC to constrain subsequent between group analysis .
__label__1 The masks represented regions with significant instantaneous positive correlation or anticorrelation with the seed region .
__label__1 Between group analyses were conducted using an unpaired t-test with significance set at p < 0.05 ( FWE corrected ) .
__label__1 All group level analyses were carried out using SPM8 software and the toolboxes MarsBar ( http : / / marsbar.sourceforge.net ) and xjview ( http : / / www.alivelearn.net / xjview8 ) .
__label__1 In the patient group , bivariate correlations were used to examine the influence of current antipsychotic medications ( chlorpromazine equivalent ) , and duration of illness on the mean coefficients within the clusters that emerged as significant from the two-sample t-tests .
__label__1 The scores on severity of hallucinations ( TVRS , VPD , PSYRATS ) were correlated with the mean coefficients within the clusters that were significantly different between patients and controls .
__label__1 The significance level was set at p < 0.05 ( FWE corrected across all comparisons ) .
__label__0 Changes in Gray Matter Density , Regional Homogeneity , and Functional Connectivity in Methamphetamine-Associated Psychosis : A Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Study Background Using regional homogeneity ( ReHo ) blood oxygen level-dependent functional MR ( BOLD-fMRI ) , we investigated the structural and functional alterations of brain regions among patients with methamphetamine-associated psychosis ( MAP ) .
__label__0 Material / Methods This retrospective study included 17 MAP patients , 16 schizophrenia ( SCZ ) patients , and 18 healthy controls .
__label__0 Informed consent was obtained from all patients before the clinical assessment , the severity of clinical symptoms was evaluated prior to the fMRI scanning , and then images were acquired and preprocessed after each participant received 6 - min fRMI scanning .
__label__0 The participants all underwent BOLD-fMRI scanning .
__label__1 Voxel-based morphometry was used to measure gray matter density ( GMD ) .
__label__0 Resting-state fMRI ( rs-fMRI ) was conducted to analyze functional MR , ReHo , and functional connectivity ( FC ) .
__label__1 Results GMD analysis results suggest that MAP patients , SCZ patients , and healthy volunteers show different GMDs within different brain regions .
__label__1 Similarly , the ReHo analysis results suggest that MAP patients , SCZ patients , and healthy volunteers have different GMDs within different brain regions .
__label__1 Negative correlations were found between ReHo - and the PANSS-positive scores within the left orbital interior frontal gyrus ( L-orb-IFG ) of MAP patients .
__label__0 ReHo - and PANSS-negative scores of R-SFG were negatively correlated among SCZ patients .
__label__0 The abnormal FC of R-MFG showed a negative correlation with the PANSS score among MAP patients .
__label__1 Conclusions The abnormalities in brain structure and FC were associated with the development of MAP .
__label__0 Material and Methods Participants We recruited right-handed men ages 18 ~ 45 years , and placed them into 3 groups : MAP ( n = 19 ) , SCZ ( n = 19 ) , and control ( n = 18 ) .
__label__0 MAP was diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases - 10 ( ICD - 10 ) research criteria .
__label__0 The inclusion criteria for the MAP group were as follows : ( a ) they volunteered to detox from METH ; ( b ) they met the criteria of substance-associated psychosis of ICD - 10 , but their course standard could be more than 1 month ; ( c ) direct laboratory evidence ( urine , blood , and hair ) proved that they had a history of METH abuse ; ( d ) they achieved the medium or serious level in ≥ t items of delusion , hallucinatory behavior , grandiosity , suspiciousness / persecution , and unusual thought content .
__label__1 The exclusion criteria were as follow : ( a ) subjects had a history of SCZ , mood disorders , neurosis , or mental retardation ; ( b ) they had a history of serious somatic diseases or organic brain diseases , such as stroke or brain injury ; ( c ) they presented a seropositive test for HIV ; ( d ) they were incompatible for MRI ; ( e ) they abused harmful substances other than METH and nicotine ; ( f ) they were delirious ; ( g ) they had a history of epileptic seizure or had a family history of epilepsy ; ( h ) they had used benzodiazepines 1 week prior to fMRI examination ; ( i ) their head translation or rotation was more than 3 mm / 3 ° .
__label__0 The inclusion and exclusion criteria of SCZ patients were similar to the MAP group , except that they met the criteria for SCZ according to ICD - 10 .
__label__1 Informed consent from all participants was obtained before the neuroimaging and other clinical assessments .
__label__1 This retrospective study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and the Institutional Review Board , and all participants signed the informed consent before participating in this study .
__label__1 Data collection and follow-up Personal information on demographics , history of psychoactive drug use , and history of body / mental disease were collected .
__label__1 In addition , detailed information on METH use and its relationship with onset and disappearance of psychotic symptoms was obtained after interviewing the patients .
__label__1 Moreover , the history of psychiatric disorders and serious somatic diseases were recorded .
__label__1 Participants were followed up for 6 months after their first interview .
__label__0 Clinical evaluation The diagnoses of MAP and SCZ were confirmed by 2 senior attending psychiatrists , and the severity of the clinical symptoms was assessed prior to the fMRI scan using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) .
__label__1 MRI acquisition The MRI scans were performed on a 3.0T Signa HDxt scanner ( GE Healthcare , America ) with an 8 - channel head coil MRI scanner at the Department of Psychology , Qiqihar Mental Health Center .
__label__0 The anatomical MRIs were administered with T1 - weighted sequence for 300 s using the fast spin echo sequence .
__label__1 Parameters for the OAx T1 FLAIR were shown as : repetition time ( TR ) = 2300 ms , echo time ( TE ) = 2.96 ms , field of vision ( FOV ) = 256 × 256 cm , image matrix = 256 × 256 , voxel dimensions = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm , layer thickness = 1.0 mm , layer gap = 0.0 mm , and 192 layers in total .
__label__0 Then , rs-fMRIs were obtained by 400 - second-BOLD-fMRI scanning with echo planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence , and the scanning orientation was parallel to the anatomical MRI .
__label__1 All participants were required to close their eyes , lie down , rest without thinking , and keep their head still .
__label__1 The parameters were set as follow : TR = 2000 ms , TE = 30 ms , flip angle ( FA ) = 90 ° , FOV = 220 × 220 mm , image matrix = 64 × 64 , layer thickness = 4.0 mm , and 33 layers in total .
__label__0 For each participant , the fMRI scanning lasted for approximately 6 min .
__label__1 Image preprocessing All the images were reconstructed and transformed to NIFTI by using the software SPM8 ( http : / / www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk / spm / software / spm8 / ) running on the MATLAB 2011b .
__label__0 Structural image preprocessing and the gray matter density ( GMD ) were performed using the same software , while the functional image preprocessing , individual ReHo calculation and whole-brain functional connectivity ( FC ) were analyzed using DPARSF 2.0 software ( http : / / www.nitrc.org / projects / dparsf ) .
__label__1 GMD The structural images were divided into cerebrospinal fluid , gray matter ( GM ) , and white matter using the unified segment .
__label__1 According to non-linear methods , the segmented subareas were spatially normalized to standard brain space , and were smoothed by a 6 × 6 × 6 FWHM Gaussian kernel to obtain a GM concentration map .
__label__1 The GMD density was analyzed using Marsbar software .
__label__1 Individual ReHo For functional image preprocessing , the first 10 volumes of the EPI sequence were discarded to avoid signal instability .
__label__1 Slice timing was conducted to correct the remaining volumes , and head realign was used to reject abnormal participants who had more than 3 mm of motion or 3.0 ° of rotation .
__label__1 The realigned sequences were spatially normalized to the MNI ( Montreal Neurological Institute ) coordinate and voxels were resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm3 .
__label__1 Then , images were band-pass filtered ( 0.01 – 0.08 Hz ) to reduce low-frequency drift and physiological high-frequency noise , including breath and heart beats .
__label__1 Then , signals were regressed out before ReHo computation , including head parameter in 6 dimensions , white matter , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , and global brain .
__label__1 Individual ReHo was calculated with the Kendall ’ s coefficient concordance ( KCC ) method .
__label__1 ReHo maps were normalized by dividing KCC among each voxel by the averaged ReHo of the entire brain and were smoothed by a 4 × 4 × 4 FWHM Gaussian kernel to avoid the spatial noise and the false data caused by spatial normalization .
__label__1 Seed ROI FCM According to the analysis of ReHo , group differences in ReHo were found , and points with peak values in sub-regions were defined as seeds .
__label__1 Spheres with a 6 - mm radius and with the seeds as the center were designated as the regions of interest ( ROIs ) .
__label__1 Each voxel in an ROI was calculated as the mean value according to the time sequence .
__label__1 Pearson ’ s correlation analysis was performed to obtain the whole-brain correlation maps , and Fisher Z translation was calculated to receive whole-brain functional connectivity maps ( FCM ) .
__label__1 Statistical analysis For GMD , ReHo , and FC analyses , one-way ANOVA was initially conducted in the SPM8 to explore whether there were significant differences among the 3 groups : MAP , SCZ , and controls .
__label__1 Post hoc analysis was performed in SPSS 18.0 to detect the group differences within ROIs between paired subgroups .
__label__1 At last , correlation analysis was administrated for 3 parameters and PANSS score in patient groups .
__label__1 The statistical threshold for one-way ANOVA in GMD analysis was set at P < 0.001 and clusters size > 40 .
__label__1 For ReHo comparison , the corrected data according with a combination criterion of voxel-wise P value less than 0.001 and cluster sized greater than 6 voxels were regarded as statistically significant , which was the same in the FC analysis .
__label__0 Abnormal degree centrality in chronic users of codeine-containing cough syrups : A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study Codeine-containing cough syrups ( CCS ) have become one of the most popular drugs of abuse in young population worldwide .
__label__1 However , the neurobiological mechanisms underlying CCS-dependence are yet ill-defined .
__label__1 Therefore , understanding the brain abnormalities in chronic users of CCS is crucial for developing effective interventions .
__label__1 The present study depicted the intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of whole-brain functional networks at the voxel level in chronic users of CCS .
__label__0 In addition , the degree centrality ( DC ) changes were correlated to the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ( BIS - 11 ) total score , dose , duration of CCS use , and the age at first use of cough syrups .
__label__0 The current study included 38 chronic CCS users and 34 matched control subjects .
__label__0 All patients were evaluated using the BIS - 11 .
__label__0 Next , resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs-fMRI ) datasets were acquired from these CCS users and controls .
__label__1 Whole-brain connectivity was analyzed using a graph theory approach : degree centrality ( DC ) .
__label__1 CCS-dependent individuals exhibited low DC values in the left inferior parietal lobule and the left middle temporal gyrus , while high DC values were noted in the right pallidum and the right hippocampus ( P   <   0.01 , AlphaSim corrected ) .
__label__1 Also , significant correlations were established between average DC value in the left inferior parietal lobule and attentional impulsivity scores and the age at first CCS use .
__label__0 The rs-fMRI study suggested that the abnormal intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of whole-brain functional networks may provide an insight into the neural substrates of abnormalities in the cognitive control circuit , the reward circuit , and the learning and memory circuit in CCS-dependent individuals .
__label__1 Highlights The abuse of CCS has gained a severe foothold among young individuals worldwide .
__label__1 DC is one of the more reliable and compelling measures among several nodal network metrics .
__label__1 The present study depicted intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of whole-brain functional networks in CCS-dependent individuals .
__label__1 CCS-dependent individuals showed altered DC in the right pallidum , right hippocampus , left IPL and left middle temporal gyrus .
__label__1 Significant correlations were established between average DC value in the left IPL and attentional impulsivity scores and the age at first CCS use .
__label__0 Materials and methods Participants This prospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital .
__label__1 Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects .
__label__0 A total of 72 right-handed participants , including 34 control subjects and 38 CCS-dependent individuals , were enrolled in this study .
__label__0 The CCS-dependent individuals were recruited from the patients seeking treatment at the Addiction Medicine Division of the Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital .
__label__1 All the patients were screened based on the DSM-IV criteria from medical history and underwent a urine test and an interview on the same day .
__label__0 All participants regularly smoked cigarettes but did not use any type of psychotropic agents prior to the rs-fMRI scan .
__label__1 The exclusion criteria for all participants included central nervous system diseases , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , prior significant head trauma , positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) status , diabetes , hepatitis C , other major medical illness , and left-handedness .
__label__1 The inclusion criteria for the control subjects was the absence of diagnosis of any type of substance abuse or dependence .
__label__0 Impulsivity assessment BIS - 11 was used for assessing the impulsivity .
__label__1 This 30 - item self-rated scale has three oblique factors : attentional / cognitive that measures the toleration for cognitive complexity and persistence ; motor that estimates the tendency to act on the spur of the moment ; and non-planning impulsivity , which evaluates the lack of sense of the future .
__label__1 Items are rated from 1 ( rarely / never ) to 4 ( almost always / always ) .
__label__1 To determine the overall impulsiveness scores , all items are summed ; high scores indicate remarkable impulsivity .
__label__0 BIS - 11 is a valid and reliable instrument for healthy Chinese and psychiatric populations .
__label__0 Data acquisition All MRI datasets were obtained using a Philips Achieva 1.5   T Nova dual MR scanner at the Department of Medical Imaging , Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital .
__label__0 These datasets included rs-fMRI dataset and T1 - weighted structural images .
__label__0 The rs-fMRI dataset [ 22 axial slices , repetition time ( TR ) / echo time ( TE )   =   2000   ms / 50   ms , matrix   =   64   ×   64 , field of view ( FOV )   =   230   ×   230   mm2 , slice thickness   =   4.5   mm without gap , flip angle   =   90 ° ] was acquired using an echo planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence .
__label__0 Each functional run contained 240 volumes ( 8   min ) [ the slices were approximately along the anterior commissure-posterior commissure ( AC-PC ) line and covered approximately 230 to 60 in the inferosuperior direction ] , and the subjects were asked to lie quietly with their eyes closed and avoid eye movement or thinking of anything specific or falling asleep while in the scanner , during the rs-fMRI data acquisition .
__label__0 Sagittal structural images ( 160 sagittal slices , TR / TE   =   25   ms / 4.1   ms , thickness   =   1.0   mm , no gap , in-plane resolution   =   231   ×   232 , FOV   =   230   ×   230   mm , flip angle   =   30 ° ) were acquired using a fast field echo ( FFE ) three-dimensional ( 3D ) T1 - weighted sequence .
__label__1 Data pre-processing and DC calculation Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State Functional MR Imaging toolbox ( http : / / www.restfmri.net.sci-hub.cc / forum / DPARSF , ) was used for the post-processing of the imaging data .
__label__1 Before pre-processing , the first 10 volumes were discarded for each subject so that magnetization reached a steady state and subjects adapted to the MRI scanning noise .
__label__0 Then , the remaining 230 fMRI images were obtained with slice time correction for the acquisition time delay and realignment of the head motion correction .
__label__0 One patient and two control subjects , who showed head motion > 1.5   mm or 1.5 ° during image acquisition , were excluded in subsequent analysis .
__label__1 All realigned images were normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) template by applying the echo planar imaging ( EPI ) template at a 3   ×   3   ×   3   mm3 resolution .
__label__1 The normalized functional image was subjected to spatial smoothing [ 6   mm half high full-width ( FWHM ) Gaussian kernel ] .
__label__1 Finally , the imaging data were processed to remove the linear trends and filtered using typical temporal bandpass ( 0.01 – 0.08   Hz ) to reduce the low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise .
__label__1 For calculating the DC , we performed voxel-wise voxel-based whole-brain correlation analysis on the pre-processed fMRI data , as described previously .
__label__1 The time course of each voxel in each brain was correlated to every other voxel time course in the GM mask .
__label__1 Thus , we could acquire a n   ×   n matrix of Pearson's correlation coefficients between any pair of voxels , where n is the voxel number of the GM mask .
__label__1 Next , we transformed the Pearson's correlation data into normally distributed Fisher Z-scores and constructed the whole-brain functional network by thresholding each correlation at r   >   0.25 .
__label__1 The threshold was the default setting while constructing the DC map .
__label__1 Only positive Pearson's correlation coefficients were considered in the present study .
__label__1 For a given voxel , the DC was calculated as the sum of the significant connections at the individual level .
__label__1 As described by previous studies , DC represents the number of direct connections for a given voxel in the voxel-based graphs .
__label__1 It has been widely used to represent the node characteristics of large-scale brain intrinsic connectivity networks .
__label__1 Statistical analysis The differences in age , education , and nicotine use between the CCS-dependent and control groups were assessed by two-sample two-tailed t-tests using SPSS statistical software .
__label__1 A two-tailed Pearson's chi-square test was performed to determine the differences in the gender between the two groups .
__label__1 To examine the between-group differences in the DC using zDC maps , a two-sample t-test was performed between the two groups using REST .
__label__1 A correction for multiple comparisons was performed by Monte Carlo simulation using the AlphaSim program , ( http : / / afni.nimh.nih.gov ) .
__label__1 The AlphaSim program was implemented in the REST software by combining the height threshold of P   <   0.001 and an extent threshold of P   <   0.01 , which corresponded to a corrected P   <   0.01 .
__label__1 The average DC values of all voxels in the significantly different regions demonstrated by voxel-based analysis were extracted independently using the extract time series in REST and entered into SPSS .
__label__1 Then , a Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to clarify the relationships between abnormal DC values of significantly different regions and clinical characteristics in CCS-dependent patients , including the duration of CCS usage , age at first CCS use , and BIS - 11 scores ; the significance levels were set at P   <   0.05 ( two-tailed ) .
__label__0 Interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings Hemispheric integration and specialization are two prominent organizational principles for macroscopic brain function .
__label__1 Impairments of interhemispheric cooperation have been reported in schizophrenia patients , but whether such abnormalities should be attributed to effects of illness or familial risk remains inconclusive .
__label__1 Moreover , it is unclear how abnormalities in interhemispheric connectivity impact hemispheric specialization .
__label__0 To address these questions , we performed magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) in a large cohort of 253 participants , including 84 schizophrenia patients , 106 of their unaffected siblings and 63 healthy controls .
__label__0 Interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization were calculated from resting-state functional connectivity , and compared across groups .
__label__0 Results showed that schizophrenia patients exhibit lower interhemispheric connectivity as compared to controls and siblings .
__label__1 In addition , patients showed higher levels of hemispheric specialization as compared to siblings .
__label__1 Level of interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization correlated with duration of illness in patients .
__label__1 No significant alterations were identified in siblings relative to controls on both measurements .
__label__1 Furthermore , alterations in interhemispheric connectivity correlated with changes in hemispheric specialization in patients relative to controls and siblings .
__label__1 Taken together , these results suggest that lower interhemispheric connectivity and associated abnormalities in hemispheric specialization are features of established illness , rather than an expression of preexistent familial risk for schizophrenia .
__label__1 Highlights Schizophrenia patients show lower interhemispheric connectivity ( IC ) compared to siblings and controls .
__label__1 Lower IC is associated with higher hemispheric specialization ( HS ) in patients .
__label__1 Siblings do not show changes on IC and HS relative to controls .
__label__1 Connectivity metrics ( IC , HS ) correlate with duration of illness in patients .
__label__0 Material and methods Participants A total of 253 participants , including 84 schizophrenia patients , 106 of their unaffected siblings and 63 healthy controls , were recruited at the University Medical Center Utrecht between September 2004 and April 2008 , as part of the Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis ( GROUP ) study .
__label__1 The GROUP study was conducted by four university psychiatric centers and their affiliated mental health care institutions in the Netherlands .
__label__1 The medical ethics committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht approved the current study .
__label__1 All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation .
__label__0 For all participants , presence or absence of current and lifetime psychopathology was established using the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History ( CASH ) .
__label__1 This semi-structured interview is designed to obtain comprehensive information on current and past signs and symptoms of major psychiatric disorders , premorbid functioning , sociodemographic status , treatment , and course of illness .
__label__1 Patients were included if they met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition ( DSM-IV ) criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder .
__label__0 Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) .
__label__1 The dosage of antipsychotic medication patients were taking at the time of scanning were converted to a chlorpromazine equivalent dosage .
__label__1 Demographic and clinical information of the three groups of participants ( controls , siblings , schizophrenia N   =   63 , 106 , 84 ) .
__label__1 Table 1 Controls Siblings Patients Statisticsa Age 29.16   ±   7.59 29.50   ±   7.65 29.86   ±   5.27 F ( 2,250 )   =   0.18 , p   =   .83 Sex ( M / F ) 29 / 34 49 / 57 70 / 14 χ ( 2 ) 2   =   31.95 , p   <   .001 IQ 113.76   ±   15.66 105.96   ±   17.10 95.99   ±   15.21 F ( 2,250 )   =   20.54 , p   <   .001 Handedness ( right / left / mixed ) 44 / 8 / 1 94 / 6 / 6 70 / 5 / 4 χ ( 2 ) 2   =   5.63 , p   =   .23 Scanner ( #1 / #2 ) 28 / 28 59 / 47 49 / 33 χ ( 2 ) 2   =   1.28 , p   =   .53 Illness duration ( years ) b – – 5.91 ( 4.12 ) – Chlorpromazine dosage ( mg / day ) – – 300 ( 200 , 600 ) – PANSS total – – 48.38   ±   14.89 – PANSS positive – – 11.58   ±   5.42 – PANSS negative – – 12.23   ±   4.35 – PANSS general psychopathology – – 24.57   ±   7.05 – Group comparison of continuous variables ( Age , IQ ) are tested with one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) .
__label__1 Nominal variables ( sex , handedness , scanner ) were compared using chi-square statistics .
__label__1 Distribution of illness duration and medication is skewed , therefore median and inter-quartile range was reported .
__label__1 Patients and siblings originated from 120 unique families and included 48 patient-sibling pairs or triplets .
__label__0 The control group comprised 63 subjects from 57 families .
__label__1 A family identification code ( family ID ) was assigned to every subject to keep track of their pedigrees .
__label__0 Siblings and healthy controls were excluded for any current or previous psychotic disorder .
__label__0 In addition , controls were examined with the Family Interview for Genetic Studies , to exclude a family history of psychotic disorders ( in first - or second-degree relatives ) .
__label__1 Exclusion criteria for all participants included a history of head trauma or major medical or neurological illness .
__label__1 All participants were between 18 and 60   years of age at the time of inclusion .
__label__1 Demographics and clinical information are described in Table 1 .
__label__0 Data acquisition MRI scans were acquired on two 1.5   T Philips Achieva scanners at the University Medical Center Utrecht , with the same acquisition protocol .
__label__1 The scanner information was included as a covariate in further group-comparisons .
__label__0 For each subject , resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) time series were acquired with a three dimensional ( 3D ) echo shifting with a train of observations ( PRESTO ) acquisition scheme .
__label__0 The PRESTO protocol combines the echo shifting technique with multiple gradient echoes per excitation to allow for a repetition time shorter than echo time .
__label__1 The acquisition parameters were : TR / TE   =   21.1 / 31.1   ms ; flip angle   =   90 ° ; field of view   =   256   ×   256   mm2 , voxel size   =   4   ×   4   ×   4   mm3 , 900 time frames , consisting of 32 slices covering whole brain .
__label__0 In addition , a T1 - weighted scan was collected as anatomical reference with the following scanning parameters : TR / TE   =   30 / 4.6   ms ; flip angle   =   30 ° ; field of view   =   256   ×   256   mm2 , voxel size   =   1   ×   1   ×   1.2   mm3 .
__label__0 Data preprocessing Resting-state fMRI data were preprocessed using the Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging ( DPABI ) toolbox on MATLAB v .
__label__1 R2016a ( Mathworks ) .
__label__1 For every subject , the first 10 functional volumes were removed to allow for signal stabilization .
__label__1 The rest of the functional images were realigned , co-registered with their individual anatomic image , and corrected for nuisance variables ( six rigid realignment parameters , signal drift , averaged signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid ) using a linear regression model .
__label__1 Band-pass filtering ( 0.01 – 0.1   Hz ) was applied to fMRI time-series to reduce effects of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise .
__label__1 Subsequently , the functional scans were spatially normalized to MNI space using a symmetric group-specific T1 template , and resampled to 3   ×   3   ×   3   mm3 voxels .
__label__1 Spatial smoothing was applied to normalized images with a 4   mm full-width half-maximum ( FWHM ) Gaussian kernel .
__label__1 In view of recent findings on the influence of in-scanner head motion on fMRI signals , images with excessive movement ( frame-wise displacement > 0.5   mm ) and 1 backward and 2 forward scans relative to the marked frame , were scrubbed .
__label__1 The scrubbing procedure negated group-differences in head motion ( before scrubbing χ ( 2 ) 2   =   6.20 , p   =   .04 and after scrubbing χ ( 2 ) 2   =   4.09 , p   =   .13 , Supplementary Table 1 ) , and did not lead to differences on the number of images rejected among the three subject groups ( χ ( 2 ) 2   =   3.54 , p   =   .17 ) .
__label__1 The Harvard-Oxford atlas was applied to whole-brain functional data in order to parcellate the brain into 112 bilateral regions ( 48 cortical and 8 subcortical regions per hemisphere ) .
__label__1 Region names , abbreviations , anatomic classification ( frontal , temporal , parietal , occipital lobe , cingulate cortex and subcortical regions ) and functional hierarchy ( primary sensorimotor regions , unimodal , heteromodal association areas , ( para ) limbic and subcortical regions ) are referenced in Supplementary Table 2 .
__label__1 The functional hierarchy subdivision scheme is based on previous studies .
__label__1 Regional time-series were averaged across voxels , and cross-correlated for each pair of brain regions using Pearson's correlation .
__label__1 Correlation coefficients were converted to z scores using Fisher's z transformation , serving as a measure of functional connectivity strength between two regions .
__label__1 Interhemispheric connectivity The level of functional connectivity between 56 regions in one hemisphere and their corresponding areas in the other hemisphere is used here as the measure of interhemispheric connectivity .
__label__1 Interhemispheric connections between homotopic regions are among the strongest functional associations in cortical-cortical interactions and have reliably been identified in both healthy and clinical populations .
__label__1 As a supplementary analysis , group-differences in heterotopic interhemispheric connectivity and left and right intrahemispheric connectivity were examined in the same manner as homotopic interhemispheric connectivity .
__label__1 Moreover , to assess the consistency of interhemispheric connectivity measurements between studies , we performed an additional analysis examining the correlation in regional interhemispheric connectivity in controls between this study and the study of .
__label__1 Hemispheric specialization Hemispheric specialization is calculated here as the difference in connectivity strength between intrahemispheric and heterotopic interhemispheric connections of each brain region .
__label__1 Homotopic interhemispheric connections were not used in the calculation of hemispheric specialization so that we could examine relationship between hemispheric specialization and interhemispheric connectivity in the following analysis .
__label__1 A positive value of hemispheric specialization indicates that a region or hemisphere is preferentially connected to other regions within its own hemisphere , whereas a negative value suggests that a region or hemisphere is more strongly connected to regions in the contralateral hemisphere .
__label__1 The method used to compute hemispheric specialization using intrinsic functional connectivity has been described in previous studies using a voxel-based analysis .
__label__1 Statistical analysis Effects of group and covariates on interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization were assessed using linear-mixed effect models .
__label__1 For interhemispheric connectivity , fixed-effects include : group status ( controls , siblings , patients ) , age , sex , handedness ( right / left / mixed ) , scanner ( #1 / #2 ) and head motion .
__label__1 To control for potential group-differences in global connectivity , mean connectivity strength of all non-homotopic connections ( i.e . , all intrahemispheric and heterotopic interhemispheric connections ) was included as a fixed-effect term ( global FC ) .
__label__1 Family ID , encoding the subjects ' pedigree information , was included as random-effect term to control for family ties between subjects ( Eq . ( 1 ) ) .
__label__1 The model has 237 observations ( number of subjects with complete information ) , and 10 fixed term predictors ( constant , group_sibling , group_patient , age , gender_female , handedness_left , handedness_mixed , scanner _ #2 , motion , global FC ) , leaving   =   237 – 10   =   227 residual degrees of freedom .
__label__1 Equation 1 : For hemispheric specialization , group status , age , sex , handedness , scanner and head motion were again included as fixed-effect terms .
__label__1 Additionally , we included hemisphere as a fixed factor to examine potential differences in connectivity patterns between the two hemispheres .
__label__1 Random effect terms include family ID and subject ID nested within family ID .
__label__1 The number of fixed term predictors is 10 ( constant , group_sibling , group_patient , age , gender_female , handedness_left , handedness_mixed , scanner _ #2 , motion , hemisphere_RH ) , and residual degrees of freedom is 237   ×   2 ( hemisphere ) – 10   =   464 .
__label__1 Equation 2 : Linear-mixed effects analysis was first applied to overall interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization ( p   <   .05 ) , and then to each of 56 regional measurements , controlling for multiple comparisons ( p   <   .05 , Bonferroni corrected ) .
__label__1 Overall and regional measurements with significant group effects were subjected to post-hoc bivariate comparisons between each pair of subject groups ( p   <   .05 ) .
__label__1 Relationship between interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization To test whether schizophrenia-related changes in interhemispheric connectivity co-vary with alterations in hemispheric specialization , we calculated the mean difference between controls and patients on both measurements for each brain region .
__label__1 Pearson's correlation analysis was performed on group-differences of interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization across regions ( p   <   .05 ) .
__label__1 The same analysis was performed for siblings as compared to patients , and for controls compared to siblings .
__label__1 Correlation between connectivity alteration and clinical factors To examine the potential clinical relevance of connectivity changes in patients , the level of interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization were correlated with illness duration and PANSS total scores in patients ( p   <   .05 ) .
__label__1 Moreover , antipsychotic medication was examined as a potential confounder of functional connectivity measurements by correlating daily medication in chlorpromazine equivalent dose with interhemispheric connectivity and hemispheric specialization .
__label__0 Bayesian computational markers of relapse in methamphetamine dependence Methamphetamine use disorder is associated with a high likelihood of relapse .
__label__1 Identifying robust predictors of relapse that have explanatory power is critical to develop secondary prevention based on a mechanistic understanding of relapse .
__label__1 Computational approaches have the potential to identify such predictive markers of psychiatric illness , with the advantage of providing a finer mechanistic explanation of the cognitive processes underlying psychiatric vulnerability .
__label__0 In this study , sixty-two recently sober methamphetamine-dependent individuals were recruited from a 28 - day inpatient treatment program , and completed a Stop Signal Task ( SST ) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
__label__1 These individuals were prospectively followed for 1   year and assessed for relapse to methamphetamine use .
__label__1 Thirty-three percent of followed participants reported relapse .
__label__1 We found that neural activity associated with two types of Bayesian prediction error , i.e . the difference between actual and expected need to stop on a given trial , significantly differentiated those individuals who remained abstinent and those who relapsed .
__label__1 Specifically , relapsed individuals exhibited smaller neural activations to such Bayesian prediction errors relative to those individuals who remained abstinent in the left temporoparietal junction ( Cohen's d   =   0.91 ) , the left inferior frontal gyrus ( Cohen's d   =   0.57 ) , and left anterior insula ( Cohen's d   =   0.63 ) .
__label__1 In contrast , abstinent and relapsed participants did not differ in neural activation to non-model based task contrasts or on various self-report clinical measures .
__label__1 In conclusion , Bayesian cognitive models may help identify predictive biomarkers of relapse , while providing a computational explanation of belief processing and updating deficits in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder .
__label__0 Highlights Methamphetamine-dependent individuals ( MDI ) face a high rate of relapse after treatment .
__label__1 Can a Bayesian learning modeling and fMRI be used to identify markers of relapse ?
__label__1 MDI who relapsed within 1   year have smaller activation to Bayesian model-based prediction errors .
__label__1 Such neural pattern was observed in left temporo-parietal junction , IFG , and anterior insula .
__label__0 MDI more likely to relapse show weaker tracking of uncertainty and updating of their belief model .
__label__0 Methods Participants The study protocol was approved by the UCSD Human Research Protections Program and all subjects gave written informed consent .
__label__0 Sixty-two ( 21% female ) recently sober methamphetamine-dependent individuals were recruited from a 28 - day inpatient Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program at the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System and Scripps Green Hospital ( La Jolla , CA ; cross-sectional analysis of these data published elsewhere ) .
__label__0 All study procedures , including the neuroimaging session examining brain and behavior responses during the SST , occurred during the third or fourth week of treatment for all participants ( i.e . , all had been abstinent from methamphetamine or any other drugs , including alcohol , for 3 – 4   weeks ) .
__label__1 To maintain sobriety during the program , participants were screened for the presence of drugs via random urine toxicology or whenever they left the facility , and were terminated from the program if tested positive .
__label__0 Participants also performed the North American Adult Reading Test as a measure of verbal intelligence , and completed self-report measures of personality and affective measures previously associated with stimulant addiction vulnerability , including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ( BIS - 11 ) , the Sensation Seeking Scale ( SSS-V ) , and the Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) .
__label__0 Lifetime DSM-IV Axis I and II diagnoses at baseline were assessed with the Semi Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism and based on consensus meetings with the supervising clinician and trained study personnel , including a Masters-level research assistant and postdoctoral-level psychologist ( see Supplementary Text 1 for exclusion criteria ) .
__label__0 Methamphetamine dependence , and not DSM - 5 diagnosis of methamphetamine use disorder , was assessed because DSM-IV was in effect at the start of the study .
__label__1 Participants were contacted one year later for a brief structured phone interview to assess for any use of methamphetamine , level of use , and time of relapse .
__label__1 At baseline , we also assessed for use and abuse / dependence criteria for other drugs ( i.e . , sedatives , hallucinogens , marijuana , cocaine or opiates ) in the past year , as part of a larger longitudinal study , which also followed individuals with other primary drugs of abuse .
__label__0 For all participants in this study , methamphetamine was confirmed as participants ' drug of choice .
__label__1 Relapse was defined as use of methamphetamine at any point during the follow-up period , while some participants may have additionally relapsed to any of these other substances ( not assessed at follow-up ) .
__label__0 Based on interview responses , thirty-nine methamphetamine-dependent individuals remained abstinent from methamphetamine from the time of treatment to one-year follow-up .
__label__1 Nineteen individuals reported that they relapsed .
__label__1 Four participants could not be tracked .
__label__0 Stop signal task Participants completed a stop-signal task ( 6 blocks of 48 trials ) while undergoing fMRI .
__label__1 On 216 go trials ( 75% of all trials ) , they had to press as fast as possible the left button when an ‘ X ' appeared or the right button when an ‘ O ' appeared .
__label__1 On 72 stop trials ( 25% of all trials ) , they heard a tone shortly after onset of the go stimulus , which instructed them not to press either button .
__label__1 Each trial lasted around 1300   ms , and trials were separated by a 200 - ms inter-stimulus intervals ( blank screen ) .
__label__1 Individuals ' reaction time ( time from stimulus onset to button press ) provided a natural jitter .
__label__1 The sequence of trial types presented was pseudo-randomized .
__label__1 Finally , prior to scanning , participants completed the SST outside the scanner to determine their mean ‘ Go ’ reaction time ( MRT ) .
__label__1 This measure was then used to determine the stop signal delay ( SSD ) for six different types stop trial of increasing difficulty , providing a subject-dependent jittered reference function .
__label__1 Specifically , stop signals were delivered in equal amounts at MRT - 0   ms , MRT - 100   ms , MRT - 200   ms , MRT - 300   ms , MRT - 400   ms , and MRT - 500   ms providing an individually customized range of difficulty ; see Supplementary Text 2 for task instructions ) .
__label__1 Bayesian model of the inhibitory response expectation To model behavior , we used a Bayes-optimal Dynamic Belief Model , which has been robustly established to capture behavioral adjustments in the SST in both healthy individuals and substance users .
__label__1 The model assumes that one 1 ) updates the prior probability of encountering stop trials , P ( stop ) , on a trial-by-trial basis based on trial history , and 2 ) adjusts behavior as a function of P ( stop ) with higher predicted P ( stop ) prompting slower Go RT and higher likelihood of correctly stopping on a stop trial .
__label__1 Mathematically , on each trial k , Pk ( stop ) is the mean of the predictive distribution p ( rk | sk - 1 ) , which is a mixture of the previous posterior distribution and a fixed prior distribution , with α and 1   −   α acting as the mixing coefficients , respectively , and where Sk   =   ( s1 , … , sk ) is 1 on stop trials and 0 on go trials : with the posterior distribution being updated according to Bayes ' Rule : A .
__label__1 P ( stop ) as a function of trial sequence .
__label__1 Top : for the sequence of go ( green dots , outcome   =   0 ) and stop ( blue dots , outcome   =   1 ) trials , Bayesian prior belief about encountering a stop trial ( P ( stop ) , red line ) , as predicted by the Dynamic Belief Model .
__label__1 P ( stop ) increases after each stop trial , and decreases after each go trial .
__label__1 Bottom : The corresponding signed prediction error ( SPE , red line , solid ) , SPE   =   stimulus outcome − P ( stop ) , and unsigned prediction error ( UPE , blue , dashed ) , SPE   =   | stimulus outcome − P ( stop ) | .
__label__1 B .
__label__1 Model fit for both methamphetamine dependent individuals who maintained abstinence over a 1   year ( black ; n   =   39 ) and those who relapsed within 1   year of treatment ( red ; n   =   19 ) ; data collapsed across all subjects for relapsed and abstinent groups separately , where Go trials were binned by P ( stop ) and average RT calculated for each bin separately ; as predicted by our Bayes optimal decision-making model , a significant positive relationship was observed between individuals ' Go reaction times ( RT ) and trial-wise P ( stop ) model estimates in each group ; black and red lines represent best linear regression fit to mean go reaction time for each group .
__label__1 Error bars   =   SEM .
__label__1 Fig . 1 In this study , model parameters for the beta distribution p0 ( r ) and α were kept constant across all participants , based on prior simulations that sought to optimize behavioral fit at the group level , i.e . , maximizing the goodness-of-fit of the linear regression of P ( Stop ) on RT across all participants ( see Supplementary Text 3 ) .
__label__1 A fixed setting of p0   =   Beta ( a   =   2.5 , b   =   7.5 ; s   =   a   +   b   =   10 ; mean   =   0.25 ) was used , and alpha was fit to participants ' data ( range tested : 0.25 – 1.0 ; α   =   0.5 maximized overall fit across all participants ; see Fig . 1A for P ( stop ) sequence ) .
__label__0 Image acquisition and preprocessing Using a fast event-related fMRI design , six T2 * - weighted EPI functional runs were collected for each participant , along with one T1 - weighted anatomical image .
__label__1 Each scanning session was conducted on a 3   T General Electric scanner with the following parameters : T2 * - weighted EPI , repetition time   =   2000   ms , echo time   =   40   ms , 64   ×   64 matrix , 30 4 - mm axial slices , FOV   =   220   ×   220   mm , in-plane voxel size   =   3.437 , and flip angle   =   90o .
__label__1 Each run included 256 repetitions for a length of 8   min and 32   s .
__label__0 Functional volume acquisitions were time-locked to task onset .
__label__0 During the same experimental session , we collected a T1 - weighted image ( MPRAGE , TR   =   11.4   ms , TE   =   4.4   ms , flip angle   =   10 degree , FOV   =   256   ×   256 , 1   mm3 voxels ) to be used for anatomical reference .
__label__0 All structural and functional image processing and analysis was performed with the Analysis of Functional Neuroimages ( AFNI ) software package , and MRI x-y slices were reconstructed into AFNI BRIK format .
__label__0 Echoplanar images underwent automatic coregistration to the anatomical image and each participant dataset was visually inspected to confirm successful alignment .
__label__1 Outlier voxels were identified in the aligned images based on whether a given time point greatly exceeded the mean number of voxel outliers for the time-series .
__label__1 Time points with high numbers of outlier voxels were excluded from subsequent analyses .
__label__1 First-level fMRI analyses In a first general linear model ( GLM ) , Go , Stop Success / SS , and Stop Error / SE trials were distinguished and convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function ( Go Error trials were scarce and not included in these analyses ) .
__label__1 Each was entered as both categorical and P ( stop ) - modulated regressor ( i.e . , Go , SS , SE , GoxPk ( stop ) , SSxPk ( stop ) , and SExPk ( stop ) ) .
__label__1 To more specifically isolate neural activity related to belief updating processes vs uncertainty tracking , a second GLM was created with two types of trial-wise Bayesian prediction errors as parametric regressors , representing the discrepancy between expected likelihood of having to stop on the upcoming trial ( i.e . , P ( stop ) ) and actual trial type observed ( i.e . , Go   =   0 , Stop   =   1 ) .
__label__1 These regressors included in this order the signed prediction error ( SPE   =   outcome-P ( stop )   =   sk-Pk ( stop ) ) and the unsigned prediction error ( UPE   =   | outcome-Pk ( stop ) |   =   | sk-Pk ( stop ) | ; see Fig . 1A , bottom ) , as well as trial error ( 0   =   correct or 1   =   error ) to control for performance error related activity .
__label__1 Each of these regressors were orthogonalized with respect to the preceding one given the non-trivial collinearity between them .
__label__1 Both GLMs included the following regressors of no-interest : a baseline regressor ( inter-trial intervals ) , three linear drift regressors ( x , y , z ) , and three motion regressors ( pitch , yaw , roll ) , and Go RTs ( residualized with respect to P ( stop ) ) to control for motor response confounds .
__label__1 Images were spatially filtered ( Gaussian full width half maximum 4   mm ) to account for individual anatomical differences .
__label__1 Automated Talairach transformations were applied to anatomical images and functional images were subsequently transformed into Talairach space .
__label__1 Percent signal change ( % SC ) was determined by dividing the signal for each regressor of interest by the baseline regressor .
__label__1 Second-level analyses At the between-subject level , two types of voxelwise mixed-effects linear models ( LME ) were fit to the coefficients of our first-level GLM .
__label__1 In the first LME , we first tested for the interaction of clinical status ( abstinent vs relapsed ) and modulation of P ( Stop ) under each Go vs Stop trials ( i.e , GoxP ( stop ) vs StopxPk ( stop ) , SS and SE were averaged ) , with subject treated as random intercept effect .
__label__1 Whole brain statistical maps were obtained for the group main effect ( reflecting areas tracking a clinical status group difference in prior P ( stop ) value irrespective of trial type ) and the clinical status X P ( stop ) modulated trial type interaction .
__label__1 In order to assess for potential group difference in the modulation of trial accuracy ( i.e . , successful vs failed inhibition ) by P ( stop ) , a similar LME approach was used .
__label__1 Specifically , we obtained statistical maps for the main effect of clinical status ( reflecting potential group difference in P ( stop ) activation on Stop trials irrespective of accuracy ) and for the clinical status X P ( stop ) modulated trial type ( SE vs SS ) interaction .
__label__1 To correct for multiple comparisons , we used a cluster threshold adjustment based on Monte Carlo simulations ( generated with AFNI's 3dClustSim program ) .
__label__1 We first calculated spatial autocorrelation function ( acf ) parameters from the 1st glm model residuals , using the 3dFHWMx function ( which does not assume a purely Gaussian acf function , but rather a mixture of Gaussian and mono-exponential ) .
__label__1 The obtained parameters , averaged across participants , were fed to the 3dClustSim function to determine FWER corrected cluster size .
__label__1 Based on the simulations , a minimum cluster volume of 896   μL was found to be sufficient to correct for multiple comparisons at FWER   =   p   <   .05 with a minimum voxelwise significant threshold of p   <   .005 .
__label__1 While less conservative than using a p   <   .001 or p   <   .002 voxelwise threshold , this setting provides a balance of adequate correction for multiple comparisons while ensuring a substantial minimum cluster size .
__label__1 We also note that this threshold is still relatively conservative in light of previous work having applied this Bayesian computational model in similar populations and experimental settings , which would provide grounds for a more focused search within the brain based on regions of interest .
__label__1 Finally , within the regions identified with those LMEs , we identified those that were consistent with a potential group difference in either type of Bayesian prediction errors ( UPE or SPE ) , using our second GLM for regions of interest ( ROI ) analyses .
__label__1 Moreover , for regions consistent with a group main effect or group X trial type interaction , we specifically checked for convergence between results from the second GLM and the pattern of activation to P ( Stop ) as function of trial type ( first GLM ) .
__label__1 Specifically , regions with non-zero P ( stop ) activations of opposite signs or with the same signs across Go and Stop trials , should be consistent with a significant group difference in UPE and SPE activations , respectively .
__label__1 This is because an SPE is equal to 0 - P ( stop )   =   − P ( stop ) on Go trials , and SPE   =   1 – P ( stop ) on Stop trials , and thus negatively correlated with P ( stop ) on both type of trials .
__label__1 In contrast , UPE is equal to | 0 - P ( stop ) |   =   P ( stop ) on Go trials and to | 1 - P ( stop ) |   =   1 – P ( stop ) on Stop trials , and thus should be positively correlated on Go trials but negatively correlated with P ( stop ) on Stop trials ( see .
__label__0 Transdiagnostic Effects of Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Cue Reactivity BACKGROUND : Elevated frontal and striatal reactivity to drug cues is a transdiagnostic hallmark of substance use disorders .
__label__0 The goal of these experiments was to determine if it is possible to decrease frontal and striatal reactivity to drug cues in both cocaine users and heavy alcohol users through continuous theta burst stimulation ( cTBS ) to the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( VMPFC ) .
__label__0 METHODS : Two single-blinded , within-subject , active sham–controlled experiments were performed wherein neural reactivity to drug / alcohol cues versus neutral cues was evaluated immediately before and after receiving real or sham cTBS ( 110% resting motor threshold , 3600 pulses , Fp1 location ; N = 49 : 25 cocaine users [ experiment 1 ] , 24 alcohol users [ experiment 2 ] ; 196 total functional magnetic resonance imaging scans ) .
__label__1 Generalized psychophysiological interaction and three-way repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to evaluate cTBS-induced changes in drug cue-associated functional connectivity between the left VMPFC and eight regions of interest : ventral striatum , left and right caudate , left and right putamen , left and right insula , and anterior cingulate cortex .
__label__1 RESULTS : In both experiments , there was a significant interaction between treatment ( real / sham ) and time ( pre / post ) .
__label__1 In both experiments , cue-related functional connectivity was significantly attenuated following real cTBS versus sham cTBS .
__label__1 There was no significant interaction with region of interest for either experiment .
__label__1 CONCLUSIONS : This is the first sham-controlled investigation to demonstrate , in two populations , that VMPFC cTBS can attenuate neural reactivity to drug and alcohol cues in frontostriatal circuits .
__label__1 These results provide an empirical foundation for future clinical trials that may evaluate the efficacy , durability , and clinical implications of VMPFC cTBS to treat addictions .
__label__0 This has been demonstrated in cocaine users , alcohol users , nicotine users , marijuana users , and opioid users .
__label__1 One promising new area of research in addiction treatment development has been transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) .
__label__1 Food and Drug Administration–approved as a treatment for depression , TMS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that takes advantage of the ability of electromagnetic induction to induce neural activity in the cortex and , by extension , in subcortical regions through monosynaptic afferent projections .
__label__1 Repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) produces frequency-dependent changes in neural activity , with high-frequency stimulation typically inducing long-term potentiation of cortical excitability and low-frequency stimulation inducing long-term depression of cortical excitability .
__label__1 Theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) , a patterned form of rTMS , is based on a rhythmic bursting pattern ; it has been used to induce plasticity in preclinical preparations and can selectively increase or decrease cortical excitability in a neural circuit–specific manner in humans .
__label__1 Prior studies from our lab have shown that single pulses of TMS to the left frontal pole induce a significant change in brain activity ( as measured by the blood oxygen level–dependent signal ) in the VMPFC and the striatum .
__label__1 This has been demonstrated through the use of interleaved TMS and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in healthy , cocaine-dependent , and alcohol-dependent individuals .
__label__1 Furthermore , when continuous TBS ( cTBS ) , an inhibitory form of rTMS , is applied to the VMPFC in cocaine users , there is a selective attenuation of TMS-evoked activity in the VMPFC , striatum , ACC , and insula .
__label__1 This paradigm was also associated with a reduction in cocaine craving .
__label__1 When VMPFC cTBS is applied to alcohol users , there is also a significant attenuation of neural activity in these regions , suggesting that cTBS has transdiagnostic effects on frontostriatolimbic circuitry .
__label__1 While VMPFC cTBS appears to attenuate TMS-evoked activity in craving-related circuitry , it is not yet clear , however , if these effects generalize to behaviorally relevant engagement of this circuit , such as during drug / alcohol cue exposure .
__label__1 The goal of the present study was to determine if cTBS to the VMPFC could reduce the brain response to drug cues ( experiment 1 ) and alcohol cues ( experiment 2 ) .
__label__1 Additionally , by uniting these datasets , we sought to test the hypothesis that cTBS would have similar ( transdiagnostic ) attenuating effects on cue reactivity in these groups .
__label__0 To achieve these goals , we performed two single-blinded , active sham–controlled brain imaging and TMS experiments wherein fMRI scans were acquired immediately before and after a session of real or sham VMPFC cTBS in a cohort of individuals with cocaine use disorder ( experiment 1 ) and alcohol use disorder ( experiment 2 ) , respectively .
__label__0 METHODS AND MATERIALS Experiment 1 ( Cocaine Users ) and Experiment 2 ( Heavy Alcohol Users ) Participants .
__label__0 Non–treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent individuals ( n = 25 ) and alcohol-dependent individuals ( n = 24 ) were recruited from the Charleston , South Carolina , metropolitan area to participate in one of two single-blinded , active sham–controlled crossover studies .
__label__1 These studies were independent but were run in parallel by the same study coordinator using the same TMS equipment and facilities .
__label__1 Following informed consent procedures approved by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional Review Board , participants completed screening assessments related to MRI and TMS protocol safety , mental status , and drug use to determine study eligibility ( see Supplemental Methods for detailed inclusion / exclusion information ) .
__label__1 Eligible participants completed two MRI / rTMS visits ( each ~ 1 hour ) .
__label__1 Before each study session , a multipanel urine drug screen ( QuikVue 6 - panel urine drug screen ; Quidel , San Diego , CA ) was given .
__label__1 Participants were told ahead of time that if they had positive urine drug screen for ( meth ) amphetamine , opiates , marijuana , or benzodiazepines they would not be eligible to participate on that day and that they would have one opportunity to reschedule .
__label__1 In this study , none of the participants had to reschedule for a positive urine drug screen .
__label__1 All participants received both real and sham VMPFC cTBS ( one type per session ) and were counterbalanced for the order in which they received stimulation ( Fp1 landmark based on the International 10 – 20 system ; 110% resting motor threshold [ rMT ] ; six sessions of cTBS for each visit ; 3600 pulses total , with a 60 - second break after the first 1800 pulses ) .
__label__0 Visit 2 occurred between 7 and 14 days after visit 1 . fMRI drug / alcohol cue reactivity task data were collected immediately before and after cTBS stimulation ( Figure 1 ) , with the fMRI scan initiated within 20 minutes of receiving real or sham cTBS and completed no later than 40 minutes after cTBS to maximize presumed effects of cTBS on cortical activity .
__label__1 Self-reported cocaine or alcohol craving ( respectively ) was assessed at five time points : upon visit initiation , before the baseline fMRI scan , before the cTBS session , immediately after cTBS , and after the second fMRI scan .
__label__1 Procedures : Clinical Assessments .
__label__0 Self-report assessments included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV , Timeline Followback [ for cocaine , alcohol , marijuana , and nicotine ] , Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test , Fagerström Smoking Inventory , Beck Depression Inventory-II , and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory .
__label__0 Timeline Followback was used to evaluate past week ’ s substance use at all study visits .
__label__1 As typically done in cue-induced craving studies , study personnel ensured that craving levels were at or below baseline before participants were dismissed from each visit .
__label__0 Procedures : Drug / Alcohol Cue Reactivity fMRI Task .
__label__0 The drug / alcohol cue reactivity task that has been used by our group in the past was administered in the MRI scanner as a block design using E-Prime 2 software ( Psychology Software Tools , Inc . , Sharpsburg , PA ) .
__label__1 The total task time was 12 minutes and consisted of six 120 - second epochs .
__label__1 Each epoch included alternating 24 - second blocks of four task conditions : drug , neutral , blur , and rest .
__label__0 Respectively , these task conditions included images of cocaine - or alcohol-related stimuli customized for each group ( e.g . , crack pipe for cocaine users , liquor bottles for alcohol users ) , neutral stimuli ( e.g . , glass of water , cooking utensils , people eating dinner ) , blurred stimuli acting as visual controls by matching substance images in color and hue , and a fixation cross for alert rest periods .
__label__1 During each task block , five images were presented ( 4.8 seconds ) .
__label__1 Procedures : Neuroimaging Acquisition .
__label__1 Participants were scanned using a Siemens 3.0T TIM Trio ( Siemens Corp . , Erlangen , Germany ) MRI scanner with a 32 - channel head coil .
__label__0 High-resolution T1 - weighted structural images were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequence ( repetition time / echo time = 1900 ms / 2.34 ms ; field of view = 220 mm ; matrix = 256 × 256 voxels ; 192 slices ; slice thickness = 1.0 mm with no gap ; final resolution = 1 - mm3 voxels ) .
__label__0 Functional images were acquired with a multislice gradient-echo echo-planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence ( repetition time / echo time = 2200 ms / 35 ms ; field of view = 192 mm ; matrix = 64 × 64 voxels ; 36 slices ; slice thickness = 3 mm with no gap ; final resolution = 3 mm3 voxels ) .
__label__0 Each functional run consisted of 328 time points .
__label__1 Procedures : cTBS Protocol—Real and Sham cTBS .
__label__1 Coil position was determined using standardized coordinates from the International 10 – 20 system ( with Fp1 corresponding to the left VMPFC stimulation target ) .
__label__1 The location and orientation of each participant ’ s coil placement was indicated on a nylon cap that participants wore throughout visit 1 and both MRI / rTMS sessions .
__label__1 Participants ’ rMT was identified via the standardized Parametric Estimation by Sequential Testing procedure .
__label__1 The cTBS was administered with a figure-of-eight Cool-B65 A / P coil ( MagVenture , Farum , Denmark ) .
__label__1 Participants received two 2 - minute trains of cTBS over Fp1 ( one train = 120 seconds ; three pulse bursts at 5 Hz ; 15 pulses / s ; 1800 pulses / train ; 60 - second intertrain interval ; 110% rMT ) ( see Supplemental Methods for details of rigorous active sham ) .
__label__1 To enhance tolerability , stimulation intensity was gradually escalated in 5% increments ( from 80% to 110% rMT ) over the first 30 seconds of each train .
__label__1 Procedures : Cue Recollection During cTBS Administration .
__label__1 Before cTBS administration , participants were asked to recall the last time they used cocaine or alcohol ( respectively ) and , using a series of standardized questions from traditional Narrative Exposure Therapy practice , they were asked to describe the place they were using , a visual description of the scene , and a description of the sensory properties of the drug including taste , smell , and sensation .
__label__1 During cTBS administration , the participants were primed every 20 seconds to “ Think about that scene you described wherein you were last using cocaine / alcohol ” ( paraphrased so as to be tailored to the participant ’ s description ) .
__label__1 Data Analysis Self-reported Craving .
__label__1 Self-reported craving scores were entered into a two-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) ( treatment type [ real / sham ] × time [ pre / post ] ) and subsequent t tests to determine the effect of treatment on changes in craving .
__label__1 Neuroimaging Preprocessing .
__label__1 MRI data were preprocessed using standard protocols via SPM12 ( Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology , London , United Kingdom ) implemented in MATLAB 7.14 ( The MathWorks , Inc . , Natick , MA ) ( see Supplemental Methods for preprocessing details ) .
__label__1 Data analyses were conducted on a total of 49 participants ( 30 men ; mean age = 34 ± 11 years ; age range = 21 – 54 years ) ( see Table 1 for detailed demographics ) .
__label__1 Generalized Psychophysiological Interaction .
__label__1 Generalized psychophysiological interaction ( gPPI ) was used to investigate task-modulated patterns of FC between the VMPFC and eight regions of interest ( ROIs ) during the drug / alcohol cue reactivity task . gPPI was conducted as described by McLaren et al .
__label__1 ( see Supplemental Methods for gPPI analysis details ) .
__label__1 We computed drug / alcohol cue minus neutral cue “ contrast betas ” indicating the relative FC during drug versus neutral conditions .
__label__1 Four contrast betas were computed : prereal cTBS , postreal cTBS , presham , and postsham .
__label__1 We aimed to show that FC between the VMPFC and several striatal and salience regions would decrease during drug / alcohol cue versus neutral cue exposure following real but not sham VMPFC cTBS .
__label__1 To do this , we conducted a three-way repeated-measures ANOVA involving treatment type ( real vs . sham ) , time ( pre vs . post ) , and ROI as independent variables and drug / alcohol versus neutral contrast betas as the dependent variable .
__label__1 Subsequent t tests were then used to determine the effect of treatment on changes in drug / alcohol cue–evoked FC across regions .
__label__1 The focus on FC analysis in the present study , rather than traditional general linear model analysis , was due to the nature of TMS effects on the brain .
__label__1 To influence subcortical brain regions ( such as the striatum ) , we applied TMS to cortical targets ( such as the VMPFC ) and took advantage of the monosynaptic functional connections between cortical and subcortical regions .
__label__1 As such , we felt that measuring the efficacy of the cTBS-induced changes in frontostriatolimbic circuits should be conducted at the level of these functional connections .
__label__1 Relationship Between Clinical / Demographic Variables and FC Changes .
__label__1 To determine whether clinical and demographic variables influenced or predicted cTBS treatment outcomes , hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted with clinical and demographic variables of interest as the predictors and covariate predictors and changes in VMPFC FC after real versus sham cTBS as the outcome variable .
__label__1 Scalp-to-Cortex Distance Measurement .
__label__1 Given that the effects of TMS on cortical depolarization are proportional to the distance between the skull and cortex , we calculated the distance from the scalp to cortex on the transverse plane of magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo images for each participant using BrainRuler software , a dedicated tool for scalp-to-cortex distance measurements .
__label__1 The average distance from participant-specific placement of Fp1 to the cortex was 17.4 ± 3.7 mm for cocaine users and 16.4 ± 3.2 mm for alcohol users .
__label__1 These distances were incorporated into the analyses as covariates .
__label__0 Understanding marijuana ’ s effects on functional connectivity of the default mode network in patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis use disorder : A Pilot Investigation Nearly half of patients with schizophrenia ( SCZ ) have co-occurring cannabis use disorder ( CUD ) , which has been associated with decreased treatment efficacy , increased risk of psychotic relapse , and poor global functioning .
__label__1 While reports on the effects of cannabis on cognitive performance in patients with SCZ have been mixed , study of brain networks related to executive function may clarify the relationship between cannabis use and cognition in these dual-diagnosis patients .
__label__0 In the present pilot study , patients with SCZ and CUD ( n = 12 ) and healthy controls ( n = 12 ) completed two functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) resting scans .
__label__1 Prior to the second scan , patients smoked a 3.6% tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) cannabis cigarette or ingested a 15mg delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) pill .
__label__0 We used resting-state functional connectivity to examine the default mode network ( DMN ) during both scans , as connectivity / activity within this network is negatively correlated with connectivity of the network involved in executive control and shows reduced activity during task performance in normal individuals .
__label__1 At baseline , relative to controls , patients exhibited DMN hyperconnectivity that correlated with positive symptom severity , and reduced anticorrelation between the DMN and the executive control network ( ECN ) .
