The O
following O
two O

are O

Proof O
It O
is O
straightforward O

note O
that O

However O
it O
will O
be O
useful O
to O

note O
the O
fact O
that O

also O
written O

Equivalently O
, O
any O

where O

Therefore O
the O

may O
also O
be O
written O

explicitly O
states O

The O
principal O

to O
the O

must O
be O
in O
the O

Again O
, O
given O
a O
singular-value O

A O

we O
have O
VSUTy O

hence O

We O

we O
also O

To O
motivate O
this O
approach O

consider O
the O

Suppose O
instead O

we O
simply O
sought O
a O

we O

SDR O

If O
we O

get O

then O
we O

So O
the O

can O
be O
viewed O
as O
a O

choose O

For O
an O

be O

equal O

Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
simply O
choose O
an O

maximum O

the O

In O

disorder I-E
( I-E

is O
a O

The O

associated O
with O
a O
small O

which O
expresses O

Additionally O
, O

This O

Results O
We O
found O
that O

SVM O
conceptually O
